I&#8217;m going to [GUADEC][1] this year!

In all my travels, I&#8217;ve visited almost all 50 states in the U.S., but I&#8217;ve never travelled internationally. Now in the span of 30 days, I&#8217;ll be visiting both [Canada][2] and [Europe][1] &#8211; and both are related for GNOME events. And I&#8217;d like to say a big thank you to GNOME for helping subsidize my travel to both events.

The initial [GUADEC schedule][3] was posted this morning, and I&#8217;m excited (and nervous) that Stormy&#8217;s and my Birds of a Feather session on GNOME marketing was accepted! (Thursday, 10:00 a.m.). I was hoping to fly back home Friday morning, but now I need to find a way to stay to see [Davyd][4]&#8216;s [talk on Documentation][5] Friday morning.

In related GUADEC news, we at the [GNOME Journal][6] are publishing a GUADEC special edition. Are you going to GUADEC? Have an interesting idea for an article &#8211; maybe from a talk you want to attend to learn about (and share about with the GNOME Journal audience!) or someone you might want to interview face to face while at Gran Canaria? Let us know, [more info is available here][7].

I&#8217;ll be seeing you in July in Gran Canaria.
