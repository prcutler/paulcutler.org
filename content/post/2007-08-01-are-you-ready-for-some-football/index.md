My favorite time of the year is quickly approaching, as we are just over a month away from the start of the college football season, and the NFL is now in full swing with training camps.

I&#8217;ve started to watch a few baseball games this year (especially when the Twins are on in HD), but nothing compares to football for me.

I was surprised to see last night that the newly formed Big Ten Network that launches Aug. 30th, will be included on the basic tier of DirecTV. And here I was already to shell out $10 / month for the sports package. I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t, as NFL Ticket just hit my bill. I&#8217;ll be interested to see how much HD bandwidth the Big Ten Network gets, as they keep talking about how they&#8217;re launching with the most HD content of any new TV channel. DirecTV&#8217;s new satellite doesn&#8217;t come online until October with more HD capacity, so this will be interesting to see.

In related news, I&#8217;ve gotten my hands on a few Packer tickets this year &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t pass up the opportunity to see Favre play knowing this is probably his last year. (But we say that every year, don&#8217;t we?)

10 days until the first preseason game! Are _**you**_ ready for some football?
