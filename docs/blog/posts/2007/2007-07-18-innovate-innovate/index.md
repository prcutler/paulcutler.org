Innovate! Innovate! Innovate! Innovate!

[GUADEC][1], the annual GNOME user and developer conference, is in full swing in England right now. One of my favorite times of the year as a GNOME user, all the GNOME developers get together and blog about all the cool stuff they&#8217;re working on, or want to be working on.

I continue to be personally excited about Havoc&#8217;s vision for enabling an online desktop. This isn&#8217;t the first time he&#8217;s discussed this, or I&#8217;ve blogged about. First, go read the [keynote presentation][2] from GUADEC. I strongly agree with this vision of the future, and get excited just thinking about it.

Havoc&#8217;s blog links to a new wiki page for the [Online Desktop][3]. Right now, it&#8217;s one simple page covering the philosophy, and hosting the presentation and screencast mockups. (This is a small thing, but what I like about this wiki page is that it&#8217;s GNOME branded. This isn&#8217;t a Red Hat thing &#8211; this is a thing that all GNOME users and developers should give some thought to, tying back to the GNOME 3.0 / Project Topaz discussions).

Havoc&#8217;s [expounds on the keynote in his blog][4]. He shares his high level thoughts around the privacy issue, data hosting, and proprietary nature of some of the web services users would want to use. Well worth a read.

I&#8217;m enjoying the other GUADEC updates via Planet GNOME, and I thought the [Multi-user Desktop presentation][5] was well worth the read.

I need to continue to be more active in GNOME, and one of these years attend GUADEC.
