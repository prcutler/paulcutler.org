A constant staple of this blog’s life over the last 10-plus years have been the constant breaks and then the “I haven’t blogged in forever!” blog posts. And here we are again.

After starting my journey to learn to program, I went a couple of months and then we sold the house and moved. That really did occupy a large chunk of time, but then all the usual excuses set in. I’ve been telling myself the last couple of months I would start and never do.  Now we are just six weeks away from the football season and if I don’t learn Python, I can never build the application I want to automate the scoring of my football pool.

Nothing like the NFL season starting to get you motivated. I’ve re-enrolled in [Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)][1] at Coursera and have decided to use Python 3.x over Python 2.x. I’m also going to work my way through [Think Python (2nd Edition) by Allen B. Downey][2], which also focuses on Python 3. I have a few ideas for what I’ll do next, but I need to do it one step at a time.

I’ve also been doing more research on how I’m going to pull the NFL stats in, but more on that later. I’m just happy to be motivated again!
