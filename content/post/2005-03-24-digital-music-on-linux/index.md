So Apple has been in the news all week, as their DRM has been stripped &#8211; but what hasn&#8217;t necessarily been said is that is hasn&#8217;t been stripped, as as much as the Apple iTunes solution implemented on Linux doesn&#8217;t apply the DRM. Technically, it&#8217;s almost impossible to apply the DRM at the server level, and when pyMusique downloads a song on a Linux box, the DRM isn&#8217;t applied as it&#8217;s not a native iTMS client like on Windows or Mac.

[I whole heartedly agree with this interview][1] with Cody Brocious, one of the 3 developers of pyMusique (along with DVD Jon) on Linux. It&#8217;s not the DRM issue &#8211; it&#8217;s the fact, as a Linux user, I don&#8217;t have any options today to buy digital music on the platform I choose to use.

I&#8217;d accept their DRM if they supported Linux. No question.

I&#8217;ve used Napster and MusicNow &#8211; I&#8217;ve bought over 20 albums in the last 6 months online. We need a commerical Linux solution for digital music.
