A big thank you to the [EFF][1] and Sen. [Chris Dodd][2] for helping to kill the Telecom Immunity bill yesterday in the Senate. The EFF has been at the forefront of this issue from day one, and Sen. Dodd&#8217;s leadership and bravery in taking a stand yesterday threatening to filibuster this bill until it died caused Sen. Reid to pull it at this point in time.

[Boing Boing&#8217;s Cory Doctorow][3] sums it up well:

> Here&#8217;s the thing: EFF and others are suing the telecoms for participating in the wiretapping program. These lawsuits are the best chance we have of getting the details of the program into the public, so we can finally find out what the NSA have been doing to us all these years. The reason the government wants to grant the telecoms immunity is to keep the dirty laundry in the closet &#8212; to keep us from finding out how they&#8217;ve been breaking the law.
