Congratulations to the winners: Fazin overall, Stirling in 2nd, Haf and Vhex tied for 3rd. (Updated per Haf&#8217;s comment).

Overall, the event was even better than last year. Well coordinated and executed, and a ton of fun. The food and drinks were good, the games and gamers even better, and a ton of fun was had by all. Except for Vhex placing for a second year in a row.
