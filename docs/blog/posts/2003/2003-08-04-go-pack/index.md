It&#8217;s only the preseason, but the first game is tonight!

8pm, Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio vs. Kansas City Chiefs.

Boo for the cheap artificial turf.

Couldn&#8217;t find out if ABC is going to be using their HD truck from ESPN. ESPN has 3 of &#8217;em, and has one out on permanent loan to ABC for MNF. But the listings don&#8217;t show tonight&#8217;s game in HD&#8230; even if it is the preseason, cameraman need practice too!

Go Pack!
