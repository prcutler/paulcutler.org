After a year and a half break from working on the arcade cabinet, it's time to start again.  I've started keeping a journal of my progress and I figured I might as well blog about it as well.  I'll use this to keep track of my progress, what I've learned, and post some photos, too.

I've never done any woodworking - or really used power tools before - so I have a lot to learn.  

Some random things I've done today:

* Circular saw - added videos to a new "Woodworking" Youtube playlist I created 
* Subscribed to [The Geek Pub](https://www.thegeekpub.com/) - for $15 / year, I get access to all the plans they sell commercially as well as some additional videos.  Plans also include the SketchUp files, an online CAD-like program.
    - 4 different arcade plans for sale (or included in their subscription)
    - I liked the 2 player standup - it seems easier that [Koenigs](http://koenigs.dk/mame/eng/index.htm) in trying to change the size
    
*  Reviewed plans again from [Koenigs](http://koenigs.dk/mame/eng/index.htm)
    * Metric only - conversion to Imperial doesn’t seem exact enough
    * Going to be difficult to build in Imperial
    * These were the plans I wanted to use for the longest time, but going to go with The Geek Pub

* Watched 2 circular saw videos
* The end of January may not be the best time for woodworking in the garage in Minnesota...
* Watched [Mavericks Arcade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxwqGQIEFqo) videos on Youtube - [LEDBlinky](https://www.ledblinky.net/ledblinky.htm) (which is Windows only) has been updated.  LEDBlinky looks really cool to control the LED lights in the buttons

* Finally swapped the control panel prototypes
    * I drilled the holes in the new panel one size too small
    * Not sure if I have right 1 1/4” drill bit?
    * Kelly cut a new piece of wood for me
    * Will the third time be the charm in making the control panel prototype?
