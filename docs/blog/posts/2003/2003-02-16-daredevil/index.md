So we went to see Daredevil last night. Suffice to say, I&#8217;m the only one who liked it. It was exactly what I expected, no less, no more. Affleck&#8217;s acting was, in my opinion, spot on for a blind man. Elektra was ok, and Bullseye was right on. 

Daredevil was one of the few comic books I read when I was a kid. I was more into baseball cards than comic books, and really didn&#8217;t even own any. Daredevil was one of the few I did read. While the revenge motive was new for the movie to get people going, I thought it was ok, even though it was a different twist than what the comic book had.

I think it was better than X-Men, which I thought was ok.

They&#8217;re all signed up for a sequel anyway, so now that we know the backstory, maybe people will accept the 2nd one more. (And the Kevin Smith cameo was good.   <img src='https://i2.wp.com/www.silwenae.net/blogs/img/smilies/icon_smile.gif?w=700' alt='&#58;&#41;' class='middle' data-recalc-dims="1" />)
