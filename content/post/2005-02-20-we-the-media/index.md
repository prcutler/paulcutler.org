I finished [We the Media][1] by [Dan Gillmor][2] last week on the flight to Atlanta.

It was a great book, and extremely topical at this time. Published last July, the book&#8217;s focus is grassroots journalism, through mainly, blogs. While the first third of the book is very high level, it&#8217;s a great starting point for folks who aren&#8217;t necessarily steeped in technology daily. The book shares some interesting history, just in the last few years, of how blogging and grassroots journalism can help hold Big Media accountable.

It also covered the ongoing fight around copyright, Big Media, with a focus on professional journalists and their role in the evolution of journalism.

Mr. Gillmor makes the point a few times that really sticks with me: most of the hundreds of thousands of blogs are too self-centered, nothing more than online journals. It&#8217;s those blogs that find a topic, and become experts through commentary, analysis, or news that really make a difference. And he&#8217;s right &#8211; those blogs I have bookmarked are exactly that, where my blog is nothing more than an online journal.

It was a very good book, easy to read, and the timing is definitely right. Mr. Gillmor has also released it under a [Creative Commons][3] license, so you are free to read it on the web without having to buy it in a bookstore. That&#8217;s putting your money where your mouth is.
