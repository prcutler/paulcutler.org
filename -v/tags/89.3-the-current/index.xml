      <description>It feels like yesterday that Minnesota Public Radio announced they would be launching their own indie rock station with a focus on local music. 89.3 The Current hired a number well known of on-air personalities who had worked in the Twin Cities for years, with experience at Rev105, RadioK and more, which just added to the excitement.

Rock the Garden, 89.3 The Current’s annual outdoor show in partnership with the Walker Arts Center, is just under two weeks form announcing which artists will be playing to a sold out crowd in Minneapolis. The Current will be announcing the lineup on April 19th.
The boys over at Reviler take a look at who they think may be playing at Rock The Garden. With such categories as “Best Guess”, “Awesome Long Shot” and “Most Terrifying Prospect”.</description>
