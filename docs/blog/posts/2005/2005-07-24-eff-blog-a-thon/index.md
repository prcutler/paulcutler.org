The [EFF][1], in celebration of their 15th anniversary, is sponsoring a [Blog-a-thon][2].

I can&#8217;t say it any better than they did:

> We want to hear about your &#8220;click moment&#8221; â€” the very first step you to took to stand up for your digital rights &#8212; whether it was blogging about an issue you care about, participating in a demonstration, writing your representatives, or getting involved with EFF. As a thank you, we&#8217;ve enlisted an independent panel of judges to choose from among your posts for &#8220;Most Inspirational,&#8221; &#8220;Most Humorous,&#8221; and &#8220;Best Overall.&#8221; At the end of the Blog-a-thon, we&#8217;ll announce the names of the three bloggers with the best posts on our website and in our weekly newsletter, EFFector. We&#8217;ll also publish the three best posts on our site and send the authors a blogging &#8220;kit&#8221; as an extra thank you: an EFF bloggers&#8217; rights T-shirt, special EFF-branded blogger pajama pants, a pound of coffee, and a pair of fuzzy slippers. 

I&#8217;ve been thinking about my story for the last few days since I first came across this. It will definitely be up by Aug. 2nd.
