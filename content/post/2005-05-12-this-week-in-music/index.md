This week&#8217;s purchases:

  * DVD:
  * The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (I dig Wes Anderson of Rushmore / Royal Tennenbaums directing fame)
  * In Good Company

  * Music:
  * New Order: NO (Was out of stock last week, but they had it this week)
  * Weezer: Make Believe (Great album, listened to it 3 times already &#8211; much more similar to their first disc, than their last disc, Maladroit)
  * Depeche Mode: The Singles (25-30 & 31-36). Released a year or two ago, the follow-up to the box sets released 10 years ago. They have multiple (sometimes up to 7) versions of the same songs from their 7&#8243; and 12&#8243; singles releases, with unreleased remixes and live tracks. A must for the collector, though they break the bank. Unfortunately, I got home and realized I don&#8217;t have 19-24. Grrr.
