I love Linux &#8211; last month was my 8 year anniversary of using Linux in some form, and next month will be the 2 year anniversary of using Linux as my only operating system when I retired from gaming.

I love Ubuntu &#8211; I love the community, the developers committed to making Linux (and Debian) better (and easier), and the wealth of applications.

But some things drive me crazy about Linux, and today&#8217;s rant is about trying to get my microphone jack to work. It&#8217;s little things like this, that in my mind should _just work_, but don&#8217;t. If you search the Ubuntu Forums for microphone, it&#8217;s amazing [how many threads pop up][1] that folks can&#8217;t get their mics to work.

I have an Intel HDA audio card built in to my motherboard. I spent a good 4 hours today trying different things to get it to work. When I started, I could listen to audio through my speakers and in my headset at the same time. Now I can&#8217;t, after changing some setting I&#8217;m not aware of. I spent hours playing with Alsamixer, Alsamixergui, Volume Control, and Sound settings. I tried to record using 2 different boom mics, different ports, different options in Sound Recorder and Volume Control, editing alsa files, all to no avail.

I have a slightly newer motherboard, though stock Intel, with a Core 2 Duo processor. Most threads I saw had problems with the Conexant chip, and I have a Sigmatel. It could be anything &#8211; it could be I&#8217;ve messed with my settings and hosed it myself, it could be that I&#8217;m running Ubuntu Edgy and in the last 6 months either Ubuntu or Alsa have a fix, and I&#8217;m just running an old version, or my hardware is still to new and folks are out there hacking on it without an answer yet.

It&#8217;s maddening, but I&#8217;ll keep trying, and when I figure it out, I&#8217;ll post an answer and help out the next folks who get stuck. But I may just install Feisty and see if I have better luck. (I know &#8211; it shouldn&#8217;t be on a main machine as it hasn&#8217;t been released yet, but I&#8217;m feeling daring!)
