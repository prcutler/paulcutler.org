Thanks to [zdz for posting a comment][1] on my [T61 Lockups][2] post.

He was absolutely right &#8211; it was an Intel / xorg driver issue causing the lockups.

A big shout out to doniphon for updating and testing Xorg at the 20/20 Conference last week. I&#8217;m running the latest Xorg on my T61, and the lock-ups are gone!

And I&#8217;m still loving the T61. Great Linux support, good form factor, and a great value. All I have left to do is figure out a bug with suspend.
