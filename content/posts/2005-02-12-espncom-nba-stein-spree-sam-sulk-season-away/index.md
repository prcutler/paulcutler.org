[ESPN.com &#8211; NBA &#8211; Stein: Spree, Sam sulk season away][1]. Marc Stein is a wise man &#8211; and he&#8217;s absolutely right. In light of Flip&#8217;s firing today, I point you to this analysis that all T-wolves fans should be thankful that Spree rejected the Timberwolves contract extension offer (3 years, $21 meelion) and haven&#8217;t signed Sam to one.

I agree with his analysis that Sam & Spree are far more to blame for the lethargy of the team than Flip. Sure, Flip has given KG some latitude, and Flip&#8217;s bizaare substitions were questionable, but at least Flip was doing something to inject energy into the team.

It will be interesting to see McHale coach the team &#8211; something he&#8217;s never done, but there is no questioning his breadth or knowledge of the game.

Here&#8217;s to a better second half.
