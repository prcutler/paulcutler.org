[Donna Wentworth gives you an overview][1] of how Blizzard is spying on you.

If this was the government, as the article points out, they&#8217;d have to get a warrant.

What&#8217;s even more distrurbing to me, is the blog comments on this article &#8211; the gamers just don&#8217;t care if it stops cheating. This is right up there with those who say &#8220;I have nothing to hide, let the government videotape/phonetap/etc&#8221;.

Where do personal rights start and end? Just because you click on a EULA, does it _really_ give a software company the right to capture what programs you&#8217;re running, who and what you&#8217;re communicating over instant messenger, and what websites you&#8217;ve visited?
