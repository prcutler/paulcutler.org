  Zoe has a new thing where she likes to go out on the deck and dance &#8211; she likes the sound her feet make on the wood.

Beautiful weather yesterday, so we fired off some shots of Zoe dancing on the deck.

I&#8217;ve got them on my [Flickr site][1].

You can [see the whole Zoe set here][2].

I also finally put up a [few of Alex from his school&#8217;s Fiesta Night in Feb.][3]
