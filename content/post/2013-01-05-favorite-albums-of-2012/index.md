With 2012 here and gone, I wanted to share my favorite albums of 2012. These aren&#8217;t necessarily the &#8220;best&#8221; albums of 2012, but these were the ones I enjoyed immensely over the past year. Almost every single one I bought on vinyl and streamed on [Rdio][2]. I tried to condense the list to a top 10, but I just couldn&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;m not going to do a major review of each one &#8211; there are plenty of sites out there from Paste to Pitchfork that can give you more information on the artists and albums below.

  * [<img src="https://i1.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8014/7303956772_c322c9d44a_n.jpg?resize=240%2C180" width="240" height="180" align="right" alt="Untitled" data-recalc-dims="1" />][3]Japandroids &#8211; Celebration Rock &#8211; Released on one of my favorite labels, [Polyvinyl][4], Japandroids rock the house and don&#8217;t stop the whole album. As I trained for some 5k races this summer, I listened to this over and over again.
  * Bob Mould &#8211; Silver Age &#8211; Bob Mould returns to early 90&#8217;s form with a rocking album reminiscent of his early solo work and with Sugar. (And the two Sugar re-issues are awesome!) The best concert I saw this year, with Bob playing Sugar&#8217;s Copper Blue in its entirety followed by songs from Silver Age and songs from his whole career.
  * Divine Fits &#8211; A Thing Called Divine Fits &#8211; This supergroup with members from Spoon and Wolf Parade nailed it.
  * Father John Misty &#8211; Fear Fun &#8211; I loved this album and my wife hated it as I made her listen to it non-stop on a drive to Milwaukee. Haunting, with beautiful lyrics.
  * Metric &#8211; Synthetica &#8211; Metric follows-up their 2009 smash album Fantasies with a return that is slightly darker.
  * RNDM &#8211; Acts &#8211; Another &#8220;supergroup&#8221;, featuring Joseph Arthur and Pearl Jam&#8217;s Jeff Ament. Jeff Ament challenged Joseph Arthur to write some up tempo songs, and they delivered.
  * Poli√ßa &#8211; Give You the Ghost &#8211; This Minneapolis band (almost a local supergroup) exploded on to the scene in Minneapolis in 2011 and quickly built a national following. The formal release date for the album was Valentine&#8217;s Day 2012, but they dropped it digitally in December 2011. Channy&#8217;s vocals, combined with the only use of autotune I&#8217;ve ever liked, are a breath of fresh air. The beats by two drummers are unique and this is probably my album of the year.
  * A.C. Newman &#8211; Shut Down the Streets &#8211; The frontman for the New Pornographers releases another solo record &#8211; if you&#8217;re a fan of his solo or New Pornographers work, you&#8217;ll love it. Nothing new, but it works.
  * [<img src="https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7107/6953232818_127e46048c_m.jpg?resize=240%2C180" width="240" height="180" align="right" alt="The Shins - Port of Morrow" data-recalc-dims="1" />][5]The Shins &#8211; Port of Morrow &#8211; Even with an all new band backing James Mercer up, the sound is the same. Again, like A.C. Newman above, nothing new but it works.
  * P.O.S. &#8211; We Don&#8217;t Even Live Here &#8211; The Minneapolis rapper explodes on his latest album. There wasn&#8217;t a better hip-hop record released last year. Here is to hoping his upcoming kidney transplant goes well &#8211; [you can help here][6].
  * JD McPherson &#8211; Signs and Signifiers &#8211; I love rockabilly and JD McPherson resurrects a lost art form.
  * Django Django &#8211; Django Django &#8211; The one album I can&#8217;t describe &#8211; but I know what I like.
  * Ladyhawke &#8211; Anxiety &#8211; Another album I listened to while running and one of my favorites to chill to on a long plane ride.
  * Stagnant Pools &#8211; Temporary Room &#8211; Another Polyvinyl release, this duo of brothers out of Indiana have a throwback sound in the vein of Joy Division or The Jesus and Mary Chain.
