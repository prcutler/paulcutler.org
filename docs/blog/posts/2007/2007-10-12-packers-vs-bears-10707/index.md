I was at Lambeau Field this past Sunday to watch the Packers eventually beat themselves and lose to the Bears on national TV.

Having grown up in Wisconsin, and now living in Minnesota, the residents of Minnesota think they have a rivalry with the Bears, but any true Packer fan will tell you the only rivalry we have is with the Bears. It was my first Bears game, and the normally nice crowd was just mean when it came to the Bears.

It didn&#8217;t help that the Packers had almost 100 yards of penalties, 6 turnovers, and didn&#8217;t rush the ball in the second half to eventually let a 10 point lead slip through their fingers.

I&#8217;ve added two sets of pictures from the game to my Flickr pages. I&#8217;m still having issues with focus on my DSLR when using my zoom lens in sports mode, I apologize if any are still blurry.

If you&#8217;re a Packer fan, join the [Packer group on Flickr][3].

We were graced with the University of Wisconsin Marching Band before the game, during halftime, and during the second half doing their routine they also do at Camp Randall.

Here&#8217;s my favorite picture from the evening:
