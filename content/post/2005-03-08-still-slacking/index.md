Can you tell I&#8217;ve been busy at work? No blog updates, which I usually do first thing in the morning, I need to get better at doing them at night.

I still haven&#8217;t hacked at the blog, I&#8217;m waiting to see what the outcome of the current [WordPress Theme Competition][1] may yield as themes go.

I generally like the dark colors as it is now, but one column isn&#8217;t cutting it &#8211; I need to add back the second column for links and stuff. So I&#8217;ll wait a month before updating it again. So far, I&#8217;m very happy with [WordPress 1.5][2]. The developers did a helluva job with the latest version. After one hiccup, the spaminator is killing all the comment spam, the interface is awesome, and I really dig the Dashboard feature.
