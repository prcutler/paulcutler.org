Know When to Hold &#8216;Em, Know When to Fold &#8216;Em, as the great Kenny Rogers sang once.

Tonight starts our first, of monthly, poker tournaments with our little clique of friends. 8 guys, 2 of which whom know how to play Texas Hold &#8216;Em are gathering together.

Lots of chats and figuring out the rules have taken place. We&#8217;ve each been assigned what to bring (food, licquor, beer, snacks, etc).

I&#8217;ll grab my camera and see if I can&#8217;t add some pics when all is said & done.

Should be a good time.
