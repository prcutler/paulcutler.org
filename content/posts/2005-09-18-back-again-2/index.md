And&#8230; I&#8217;m back. Spent most of last week traveling in Houston for work. This was my first significant time spent in the big ole state of Texas, and in some ways it&#8217;s a different world down there.

First, housing is much cheaper. Like 50% cheaper than here &#8211; and with no state income tax, cost of living must be much lower. It was 90 and humid all week &#8211; I loved it. I had the opportunity to go to Minute Maid Park and watch the Astro&#8217;s play. It feels like they just tried to cram a MLB stadium into a few spare blocks they had open in downtown &#8211; the place is tiny. All the modern amenities, but looking into the outfield and just seeing walls and no bleachers wasn&#8217;t right.

Demographics were very different. Texas state flags were everywhere &#8211; they don&#8217;t call it the Lonestar State for nothing.

Now, back to blogging.
