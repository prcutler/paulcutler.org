We are just two weeks away from the [Boston Summit][3] which is also the site of the upcoming [Snowy Hackfest][4]. We&#8217;re cooking up all kinds of plans for the hackfest. Our goals include:

  * An HTML5 mobile client
  * Integrating note editing into Snowy so you can edit your notes in a web browser
  * Focus on the user interface

In other news, [Snowy 0.5, &#8220;Cavalier King Charles Spaniel&#8221;, was released on Monday][5] to coincide with the GNOME 2.91.1 release and Tomboy Online was updated to Snowy 0.5. There is a method to the madness in Sandy&#8217;s choice of release names &#8211; I have a GNOME sticker (or stickers) as a prize to the first person who can tell me. (_Contest not open to Snowy developers. Must be a resident of Planet Earth. Other rules and restrictions may apply but probably not. I&#8217;ll pay postage._) Version 0.5 was a minor bugfix release &#8211; expect lots of big changes after the hackfest. (Note I just say after &#8211; can&#8217;t hold me to a date!)

We received some new UI mockups &#8211; [check them out][6] on the wiki! Here&#8217;s one:

The second wave of alpha invites went out on Monday. If you&#8217;re on the list, you just got a bit closer to getting our invite! Thanks to our alpha testers, we&#8217;re getting some great feedback via [email][8] and [Bugzilla][9]. Keep it coming!

Lastly, I was added as an administrator to help with new account activation. Commence evil genius laugh.
