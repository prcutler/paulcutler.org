With 2013 now in the books, I&#8217;d like to share some of my favorite albums of 2013. After Polica dropped their debut album digitally on December 20th, 2011, I&#8217;ve learned to wait until the year is over to share my favorite albums &#8211; don&#8217;t want to miss one!

These might not be the critic&#8217;s choices, but these are albums I like, and almost all of them I&#8217;ve bought on vinyl this year. In no particular order:

**Frank Turner** &#8211; _Tape Deck Heart_ &#8211; [89.3 The Current][1] started spinning the second track from this album, _The Way I Tend to Be_, just a few months ago, and I fell in love. Giving the album a listen on Rdio, and then his back catalog, I realized how many of his songs I knew, without even knowing who the artist was. This is a fantastic album with catchy hooks and amazing lyrics. The only downside is the vinyl album didn&#8217;t come with an MP3 download card.

**Free Energy** &#8211; _Love Signs_ &#8211; As a child and fan of everything 80s (well, maybe except the fashion), I love the 80s style power pop of this album. It started the year out with a bang and this albums knows exactly what it is &#8211; unapologetic pure fun.

**The National** &#8211; _Trouble Will Find Me_ &#8211; I&#8217;ve always liked The National &#8211; and this album, along with their previous effort, really solidified for me how good they really are.

**Chvrches** &#8211; _The Bones of What You Believe In_ &#8211; This is arguably my favorite album of the year. I&#8217;m just kicking myself for not going to see them at First Avenue earlier this year. Chvrches brings back that 80s power synth sound and merges it with today&#8217;s indie movement. Fantastic debut album.

**Dessa** &#8211; _Parts of Speech_ &#8211; Local singer / songwriter / poet and member of the Doomtree collective. Good songwriting combined with her and Aby Wolf&#8217;s vocals made this a great album. The lead single, Warsaw, was nothing like she&#8217;s done as a solo artist and hit me like a hammer the first time I heard it. The Current did a special with her live at the Fitzgerald Theater, Dessa Deconstructed, which combined a live interview with Dessa mixed with a live performance. It&#8217;s available on YouTube and my favorite part was where she broke down the making of Warsaw.

**Mikal Cronin** &#8211; _MCII_ &#8211; I took a gamble on this album as I&#8217;m a fan of most artists on the Merge label, and it quickly became a favorite of mine. I was quite happy to see this make a bunch of &#8220;Best of 2013&#8221; lists as it didn&#8217;t seem to have much buzz or airplay.

**Superchunk** &#8211; _I Hate Music_ &#8211; When I started running again early this summer, this was my go to album. If you&#8217;re a Superchunk fan, there&#8217;s not a lot new here, but it&#8217;s a short album at 40 minutes, and fast paced with a good beat. I&#8217;ve always liked Superchunk and this album doesn&#8217;t disappoint.

**Neko Case** &#8211; _The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You_ &#8211; Neko Case&#8217;s last album, _Middle Cyclone_, was the first vinyl album I bought when I got back into vinyl a few years ago, on clear vinyl on the second Record Store Day, no less. I&#8217;m a huge fan of the New Pornographers, of whom she is a member, and I&#8217;ve always enjoyed her solo work. It&#8217;s much more personal and raw, and this album is especially so as Ms. Case [has talked about her struggles leading up to this album as she was depressed and grieving the loss of her grandmother][2].

**Volcano Choir** &#8211; _Repave_ &#8211; Is there anything Justin Vernon of Bon Iver does that doesn&#8217;t turn into gold? The second album he was a part of in 2013 (the first being the blues rock Shouting Matches), Repave is the second release by Volcano Choir and one in which he didn&#8217;t write any of the songs, but still retains a very Bon Iver feel. There&#8217;s not a lot I can say about this that [Barb Abney of 89.3 The Current hasn&#8217;t already said][3].

**Har Mar Superstar** &#8211; _Bye Bye 17_ &#8211; Six or seven years ago I was volunteering at MPR and they handed me a few CDs for helping out for an afternoon. One of them was of Har Mar Superstar, whom I hadn&#8217;t heard of at the time, but quickly learned to love. With the lead single, _Lady, You Shot Me_, Sean Tillman aka Har Mar Superstar takes us back to the old soul sound and it works.

**Caroline Smith** &#8211; _Half About Being a Woman_ &#8211; Another local Minnesota artist, Ms. Smith ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for her latest album of which I participated in. When the vinyl reward ran late ran late, she sent all of her vinyl backers a copy of the CD, which was a great touch as we had already received access to the MP3 download. Like Har Mar Superstar above, her album is a tribute to the classic Motown soul sound and after a few listens, you will forget that it came out in 2013.

**Janelle Monae** &#8211; _The Electric Lady_ &#8211; this soulful, funky concept album has received rave reviews and not enough airplay. This is unlike most music out there and if you haven&#8217;t listened to it yet, go do it now. Â It will make you dance.
