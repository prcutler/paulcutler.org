  There was a huge storm Monday night, and the sky was 3 different shades of colors.

Attached are two (attempted) panoramic shots of the sky from my backyard. Unfortunately, on both attempts, you can clearly see the stitching lines, but you can see the sky changing colors.

The big one above was made with Microsoft&#8217;s Digital Image Suite 10, and the second, smaller one below was made with The GIMP with just the first two photo&#8217;s.
