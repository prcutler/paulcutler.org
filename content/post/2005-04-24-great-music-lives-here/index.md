Re-ripping my CD collection for the 4th time in as many years, I&#8217;m reminded of all the great music I own, that I rarely listen to.

Having everything located on a central server you can stream from, either by artist or just random, let&#8217;s you hear things you haven&#8217;t heard in years.

I need to get the server back up. Soon.
