Michael Larabel, of Phoronix fame, has a [blog post][1] noting that Gamestop has started pre-orders for [Enemy Territory: Quake Wars][2], and Best Buy will begin pre-orders on April 12th, with the game being released on June 5th, the first time I&#8217;ve seen a release date assigned.

As I&#8217;ve noted previously, this is the first time in a long time I&#8217;ve been this excited over a game release. Since I gave up Windows 2 years ago after being a hardcore gamer for many years, I&#8217;ve cut way back on my gaming, and have pretty much turned into a console gamer. I still play Battlefield 2 about twice a month at a buddy&#8217;s house who has an extra PC set up for me, which is quite fun when playing with friends in a squad. I&#8217;m hoping ET:QW takes the squad based, objective elements to a new level for a first person shooter. That, and it&#8217;s the Doom3 engine, so it will be gorgeous. Once UT2k7 comes out later this year, I should have plenty to keep me busy gaming on the Linux platform.

I did have UT2k4, Doom3 and Quake IV installed on my Linux PC, which reminds me I need to get it installed on my new Foresight installation, and throw up a wiki page for installing 3D games on Foresight.
