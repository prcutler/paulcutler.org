<p>Gates Part Four: Communists and DRM up.</p>
<p>Bill Gates, Microsoft’s chariman has been getting flak for some comments at CES where he equates those who don’t favor copyright and DRM as communists. He more than proves that it’s Gates himself that doesn’t get it in the above interview.</p>
<p>Look Bill: No one questions that artists should be compensated for their work. Period. The fact that some of us may choose to create content, say, a blog, and not want to be compensated, and want to share it, is our choice. And when we do choose that, we can choose to use the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">Creative Commons licenses</a> to share our work.</p>
<p>God forbid a music artist, or the spoken word, or the written word want to be given away at the artists’ discretion. It’s worked in the programming world, and more and more examples in the media world have started.</p>
<p>Viva la revolution.</p>
