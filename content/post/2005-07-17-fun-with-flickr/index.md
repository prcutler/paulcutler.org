As I mentioned [two weeks ago][1], I&#8217;ve uploaded all the old photo&#8217;s I had to [my Flickr][2].

It turned out to be just over a 1000 photo&#8217;s, with the most in the last two years. I had some good ones of Alex going back to 2001, and a ton of Zoe baby pictures.

They&#8217;re all uploaded, grouped in to sets, and I re-orded my [set list][3] to be in chronological order with all the kid photo&#8217;s.

I&#8217;ve added our Fourth of July photos, and we&#8217;re caught up in the present again.
