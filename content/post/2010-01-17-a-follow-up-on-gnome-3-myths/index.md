Friday I wrote a [blog post][1] kicking off a [wiki page on debunking GNOME 3 myths][2]. The [dozen or so comments left on that blog post][3] highlight perfectly why we need a wiki page that debunks myths &#8211; and it&#8217;s a good place to start to add to the wiki page. (And refine it, I think some of the comments are valid).

If you&#8217;re a GNOME developer, please give the [GNOME 3 Myths page][2] a look over and add any questions that you have been asked.

Thanks!
