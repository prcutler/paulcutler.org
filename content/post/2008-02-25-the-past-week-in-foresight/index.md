Lots of stuff going on:

  * [Alpha 4 was released][1]! Tons of bug fixes, OOo is back in, and still lots to do. [Read the release notes][2].
  * Work is flying on the new website. [SpecialKevin][3] and [Etank][4] have done a ton of work, [Stefw][5] is helping with content, and [Nixternal][6] wrote some great Javascript menus.
  * Do you know CSS, HTML and PHP? Help us theme our Planet, a WordPress theme, or our new forums that will be launching soon using the new website&#8217;s CSS. Sign up on our [marketing list][7] and lend a hand.
  * The second revision to the Foresight User Guide is about half done, and I hope to have it finished this week. Writing it in [docbook][8], and then I plan on porting it back to the [wiki][9]. Want to help? [Join the docs team][10].
  * Dateline Fosdem: [Ken VanDine][11], [doniphon][12], Mark__T and more met up this past weekend. I hope they blog about it, sounds like they had a great time.
  * Do you create packages on [rBuilder][13] and commit to your own repository for use on Foresight or directly to the Foresight repo? [Use your GPG key to sign your packages][14].
  * Congratulations to Eric Lake, Mark Trompell and Will Farrington approved as Foresight developers; and Matthew West as a Foresight member, who were all approved at [last week&#8217;s Focus meeting][15].

More to come soon, and maybe even a really big announcement sometime in March.
