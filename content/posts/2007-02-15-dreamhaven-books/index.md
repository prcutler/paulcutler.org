[Dreamhaven Books][1] on Lake Street in Minneapolis is one of my favorite bookstores that I&#8217;ve ever been to. Dreamhaven specializes in science fiction, comic books, and fantasy and horror. Not only does one of my [favorite authors frequent there][2], they have a great collection of new and used books, with some of the deepest catalog selections you&#8217;ll see in a book store. They have very rare books, and a large selection of author signed books.

Unfortunately, [Neil Gaiman writes on his blog][3] that Dreamhaven was broken in to Saturday. From the email he received from Greg Ketter, owner of Dreamhaven:

> We had a break-in on Saturday night. They got a bit of cash but wreaked
  
> terrible havoc on the store and my office. Damages will be costly but
  
> insurance should cover a lot of it. But after the lull in current
  
> business, this really will hurt. I don&#8217;t like charity but if you could
  
> encourage people to maybe buy an extra book off us soon, it may help.
  
> Three bookstores have closed in the Twin Cities in the past two months and
  
> I don&#8217;t want to make it four.

Hit up [Neil&#8217;s blog for more info][3]. Dreamhaven was the bookstore that sponsored Neil&#8217;s reading and showing of Mirrormask late last year for the launch of Neil&#8217;s latest book, Fragile Things. This was where I won a [very rare copy of Mr. Gaiman&#8217;s Angel&#8217;s & Visitations][4], that was published by, who else, but Dreamhaven books.

I get to Dreamahaven a couple of times a year &#8211; and I was just there last Friday spending my birthday money a day before the break-in. Looks like I&#8217;m on my way back to pick up an extra book or two to help them out in their time of need.
