I had mentioned in my [Colony 4 upgrade post][1] some of the problems I was having. It turns out the icons weren&#8217;t appearing because I had a custom theme chosen. Choosing Clearlooks set everything right again, though Ubuntu seems to have changed the [Tomboy][2] icons in the panel and in the Applications menu.

Doing an apt-get upgrade after getting home from traveling resulted in 24 hours of panic. Upon upgrading, my networking stopped working. It seems I wasn&#8217;t [the only one with this problem][3], but thankfully one of the posters in that thread mentioned how the upgrade seemed to have stopped half way through. Going to a terminal and doing another apt-get upgrade and a reboot fixed the problem, thank god.

Overall, I&#8217;m still very happy with Breezy Badger. I&#8217;m waiting for the X.org packages to get a bit more stable as it seems I upgrade them almost daily and then I&#8217;ll get my monitor and ATI drivers working properly.

Just a few weeks from Breezy Badger going final!
