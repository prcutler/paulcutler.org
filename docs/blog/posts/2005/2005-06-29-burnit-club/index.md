How cool is this &#8211; the [Burn It club][1]?

I came across [Kymberlie McGuire][2] via her [Flickr site][3].

The Burn It Club looks very cool &#8211; every quarter she picks a theme, past themes have included driving music, remixes, and school, and you email her to join a group. She puts you in a group of 4, and you make 5 mix CDs (all different artists and songs, just follow the theme), one to keep, one to send to Kymberlie and each person in your group, and you get one in return.

I&#8217;ve bookmarked the site and definitely want to join in on that the next time it comes around. What a cool idea.
