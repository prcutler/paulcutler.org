GNOME Do&#8217;s [final project report has been released.][1] GNOME Do was originally started as an academic project by a few students at the University of Pennsylvania.

I would like to direct you to page 13, where Foresight and Shuttle both receive mentions:

> Our most recent release was 0.4.2., released on April 15, 2008. GNOME Do now has packages in every major GNU/Linux distribution, and is even installed by default in Foresight Linux and a few others. Shuttle, a boutique PC retailer, is now selling a line of loc-cost Linux PCs that have GNOME Do running on them by default.

Thank you to David and Douglass for all their hard work, and the mention!
