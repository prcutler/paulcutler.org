Planet Foresight is moving!

Currently located at www.foresightlinux.org/planet you may have noticed that it now only updates once a day. The current planet uses Feedjack, a Django module, which was crashing our webserver for some unknown reason and we had to turn off updates and instead run a cron job.

Our resident Alaskan, smithj (with [his own shiny new blog][1]!), has been kind enough to set us up with our own [Venus planet][2] [appliance][3], now at <http://planet.foresightlinux.org>.

If you subscribe to the current planet in a feedreader via RSS, please update your feed to: <http://feeds.feedburner.com/foresightplanet>

We will be migrating the official feed in about a week.
