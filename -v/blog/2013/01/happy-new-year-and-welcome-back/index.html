                <p>Welcome to the revamped paulcutler.org.</p>
<p>I’m your host, Paul. With January upon us, the blog has officially turned 10(!). One of my New Years resolutions is to blog more – I only blogged twice last year, but I can’t tell you the number of ideas I had for blog posts that I saved in Evernote, Google Reader or Pocket / Instapaper. This year I hope to follow through on that a bit more.</p>
<p>With the blog’s ten year anniversary here, I went back and looked through some of the old blog posts – and quickly wished I hadn’t. Maybe that’s not fair, but I believe my writing style has improved since I first created the blog. The blog has gone through a number of iterations – first as a place to share whatever I wanted, including technology, digital rights, sports, or gaming. Later, as I became more involved with open source projects, the blog became a place to share news or thoughts about the projects I was involved with. As I became less involved, and with the rise of Twitter, the blog posts tapered off.</p>
<p>I plan to go back to the original premise and share my thoughts and interests on technology, digital rights, tabletop games and anything else that might come to mind. I’ll share interesting links from around the web – some you may already have seen and others may be new to you.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’ll be talking about music. I’ve always been an avid music fan, but a few years ago I bought my first turntable and got into vinyl in a big way. I started a music blog, which also has suffered from a lack of posts in the last year. I’ll be combining the blogs and only using the blog at paulcutler.org going forward, so this is also where I’ll be talking about music.</p>
<p>In preparation for 2013, I’ve spent some time re-designing the <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org" title="paulcutler.org">home page</a> and the blog. But we’ll save that for another post. You have to have a reason to want to come back, right?</p>
