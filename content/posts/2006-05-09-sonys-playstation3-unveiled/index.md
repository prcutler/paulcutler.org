Sony unveiled the Playstation3 [at a launch event at E3 last night][1].

Quick facts:

US Launch: Nov 17th
  
2 Versions ([Comparison Chart Here)][2]:
  
$599: 60GB Hard Drive, HDMI, Wireless, Memory Card Reader
  
$499: 20GB HD, none of the above

2 million to ship at launch, 2 million more by end of the year, worldwide.

The combination of Blu-Ray built in, as well as the previously announced Linux operating system make this the console player for me. But only the $599 one &#8211; HDMI is a must-have!
