      <description>I haven’t blogged in almost a year, so here’s a picture of Alex with Jack and Zoe. Alex graduated from boot camp in the United States Navy last week and is embarking on his new career as a nuclear engineer.</description>

      <description>My youngest son turns 7 at the end of this week. After starting a new job in early 2012 that had a lot of travel, I “borrowed” one of his Lego Stormtrooper Minifigs who needed a vacation from the daily grind of the Empire. He travels around with me and I’ve captured his adventures on his own Tumblr.
My wife tells me Jack giggles when he sees the updates, which makes it all worth it.</description>

      <description>I was traveling in Los Angeles when Kelly got a bit of a scare last week.
Jack was running around upstairs, ran into the bathroom, and he slid on the linoleum right into the shower door.
With a cut on his head bleeding profusely, I think Zoe was more scared than Jack was. (Zoe seems to have rolled a high D20 for empathy when she was born).
Kelly rushed them to the emergency room, where they numbed Jack and gave him 6 stitches.</description>
