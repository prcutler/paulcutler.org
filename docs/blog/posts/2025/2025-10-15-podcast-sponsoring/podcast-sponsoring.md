I've re-opened the podcast sponsorship page on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/sponsors/prcutler) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/prcutler). The [Sponsors page](https://www.circuitpythonshow.com/pages/sponsors) includes a list of current and past sponsors and the cost breakdown for running the podcast.

If you're curious, it costs about $400 / year for the podcast.  From the [Sponsors page](https://www.circuitpythonshow.com/pages/sponsors):

### Cost breakdowns - annual fees
* Podcast hosting (Castopod.com): $120 / year
* Video recording (Boomcaster.com): $240 / year ([Referral link](https://www.boomcaster.com/?ref=6oqOUUYpjBHg49mH))
* Calendar and scheduling for guests (Fantastical): $60 / year

### Miscellaneous costs (one-time):
 * Reaper digital audio workstation: $60
 * Hush audio app: $90

 Thanks for your support - and stay positive!
