The server&#8217;s back. And better than before. 340 gigs of loving, properly configured this time so if I have to replace the OS the data should stay (well, most of it).

Highlights of getting the server (silwenae.net) back online:

DHCP working
  
Firewall working
  
[Basic homepage up][1]
  
[My blog up][2]
  
Messed around for hours with my blog trying to import [b2evo][3] into [WordPress][4]. No go.
  
Messed around some more with styles for my blog.
  
Installed [Alex&#8217;s blog][5]
  
Installed [Zoe&#8217;s blog][6]
  
Installed [gallery][7]  [for the family pictures][8].
  
[Put the pictures of our Packer training camp visit into gallery][8]
  
Reconfigured the three wireless networks (Linksys & D-Link 802.11g, D-Link 802.11a)
  
Spent a couple hours trying to get <a href="http://www.netjuke.org>netjuke&#8221;</a> up, no go 

Other fun stuff this weekend:

Installed Fedora on my laptop (long story)
  
Transferred music for Matt onto a USB hard drive (only took me 6 months, slacker)
  
Found power cables for a 5 year old laptop and prepared it for shipping
  
Swapped out networking equipment on Alex and Kelly&#8217;s computers (put in D-link, removed Microsoft)
  
Finished a book (The Eagle Has Landed)
  
Watched Fast Times at Ridgemont High
  
Watched the Packers / Jaguars game 

My den is a mess. Cleaning that up and mowing the yard are the only things I didn&#8217;t get to on my to-do list this weekend. Not bad.
