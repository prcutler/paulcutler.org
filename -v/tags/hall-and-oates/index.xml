      <description>Hall &amp;amp; Oates play a sold out show tonight in Minneapolis at the State Theater. I fondly remember growing up listening to my father’s lite rock station as their hits were played. With six #1 songs, it’s good to see Hall &amp;amp; Oates music celebrated for the pop genius that it is. No one is going to pretend that their songs will change the world, but they are catchy and stay with you long after you hear them – which is exactly what a good pop song should do.</description>
