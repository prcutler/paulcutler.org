I picked up a copy of [Enemy Territory: Quake Wars][1].

Now I&#8217;m just playing the waiting game for the [Linux binary][2] so I can play it.

I think the actual game is more fun.

But I wanted to make a statement by picking up the game during release week &#8211; it&#8217;s important to me to support commercial game companies who make Linux compatible games.
