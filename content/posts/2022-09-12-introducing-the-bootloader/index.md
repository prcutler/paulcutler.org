Having just passed the six month anniversary of The CircuitPython Show, I’ve decided to start a new podcast!

Introducing The Bootloader.

I’m teaming up with [Tod Kurt](https://todbot.com/about.html) and together we’re going to bring you a few interesting things we found around the web.  We’ll each share up to three things, each one for a few minutes, but no more than five.  That should keep the show right around a half hour, which is optimal.

The three things can be almost anything.  It could be a news item, we  could share a project we came across or following,  we might highlight a maker and their work, or we could talk about a product we love (or hate).  It could be news, it could be something older that’s new to us.  Hopefully you’ll find it interesting, too.

You can subscribe to the [podcast on all major platforms or via RSS](https://zencastr.com/The-Bootloader) (we'll be on Google Podcasts soon, but just add the RSS to your podcast app), follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thebootloader), watch us on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdnYGzS7QVLBY70xG5VLd6Q), or visit [our website](https://thebootloader.net).

Give us a listen and [watch the trailer here](https://zencastr.com/z/3SD-TPX9)!
