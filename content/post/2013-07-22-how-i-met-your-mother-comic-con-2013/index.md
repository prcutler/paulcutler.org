I&#8217;m a fan of the show How I Met Your Mother. Like most viewers though, I&#8217;m of th eopinion it&#8217;s time for the show to end. As much as I&#8217;ve enjoyed it over the years, I was disappointed when they decided to extend it one more year.

Apparently, Ted&#8217;s kids agree with me, [from this video show at this years Comic-Con][1].

(Why CBS doesn&#8217;t allow it to be embedded is beyond me&#8230;)
