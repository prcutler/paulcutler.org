                <p>I bought a copy of Crackdown when it came out a few months ago, and was quite happy with the game. It was fun to play a GTA-style game on the side of the good guys for once.</p>
<p>An added benefit of buying Crackdown was an exclusive invite to the Halo 3 beta, which went live this past Wed. Or was supposed to. Of course demand was higher than expected, and the download was delayed a few times throughout the day.</p>
<p>I was finally able to download, and I start the beta through Crackdown – which takes about 10 minutes from start to finally getting in the game after going through the Halo 3 lobby and matchmaking. And each time I try to play, I get an error: “The disc is unreadable” – which is kind of funny as there is no disc.</p>
<p>There are a <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Forums/posts.aspx?postID=10787368">few</a> <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Forums/posts.aspx?postID=10918577&amp;v%20iewreplies=true#end">threads</a> on the Bungie / Halo 3 forums about this, with other folks having the same issue, and no clear cut fix. Quite frustrating, to say the least.</p>
