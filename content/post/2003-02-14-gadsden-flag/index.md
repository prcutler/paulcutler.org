I have added the Gadsden Flag to [Silwenae.com][1] and linked it to [America Live Free][2]. The Gadsden Flag is becoming more and more popular as a way of showing support against President Bush&#8217;s attempts to restrict civil liberties.

I know my views aren&#8217;t always agreed with &#8211; but even under a threat of so-called war, there absolutely no reason to be reading citizen&#8217;s emails, opening up wire-taps, and other proposed legislation that limits us.

I&#8217;ll leave you with this from America Live Free:

_
  
We recognize that informed dissent is patriotic, that questioning the government&#8217;s actions is patriotic, that demanding that all branches of government adhere to the Constitution is patriotic. For it is the patriotic dissenter who has the greatest commitment to the ideals upon which our nation was founded and it is he that keeps our nation on the right path. </p> 

This is the time for us to reaffirm the foundation, the cornerstone of our Democracy. It is time for us to rise up and stand for the promise, the vision, the guarantee of what our founding fathers had in mind for us: one great nation of free people, pursuing life, liberty and happiness. 

We, the people, stand for the Constitution. We stand for our country. We stand for freedom. 

Do not tread on us.
