                <p>As I attempt to learn Python, I’m fascinated by how people are able to do this as well as how they started to learn to program.</p>
<p>I’m not the only one, as Ryan Gordon (aka <a href="http://www.icculus.org/~icculus">Icculus</a>), a well known game developer who ports many games to Linux and Mac, asked a similar question on Twitter last month.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This led to a lot of interesting tweets and Ryan <a href="https://storify.com/icculus/how-i-got-started-programming-stories">created a Storify page to share them</a>. Josh “Cheeseness” Bush <a href="http://cheesetalks.net/first_coding_exp.php">wrote up a great analysis</a> of those tweets sharing graphs looking at the languages, hardware and more about the people who replied used to get started with programming.</p>
<p>Even though I’m just starting to formally learn to code now, my story with computers is similar to a lot of those stories.</p>
<p>It all started in the early 80s when my father bought a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair">Timex Sinclair TS1000</a> (aka ZX81) and then a TS1500.  You could load games via tape and also buy magazines with the code to program your own games.  I spent hours handtyping machine code to create games like Breakout.</p>
<p>A few years later my father bought an Apple //c and I then learned Logo, Basic and others.  Nothing that I ever really stuck with from a programming stand point, but enough to learn the basics and spend hours tinkering.</p>
<p>After that, my father bought a an IBM clone 286.  I remember being at Sears with him and telling him to spend the extra money to get a 386, but even a 286 was at least $2,000 back then.  I remember it ran GeOS for a graphical interface and one Christmas, after I received the original Wing Comannder as a gift, I had to buy MS-DOS 5 just so I could use the himem.sys to have enough memory to run the game.</p>
<p>From the Apple //c on, we always had a modem as well.  Starting with a 300 baud modem to a 1200 baud modem later, I started visiting BBSes on the Apple //c and later on the IBM clone as well.  (We had a Compuserve account early on, but hourly charges!  Ouch.) As a teenager I would go to meetups and actually meet the people I was interacting with on a BBS in a real life – something I’d do twenty years later when I got involved in open source and <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>.</p>
<p>Using Linux for years and being involved with GNOME, taught me how to use a shell, basic XML with Docbook, and revision control with Git.  But now it’s time to learn a formal language and make my first program.</p>
<p>In many ways, I still consider myself an early adopter and if it weren’t having access to computers at a young age, both in home and in school, I’d be a much different person today.</p>
