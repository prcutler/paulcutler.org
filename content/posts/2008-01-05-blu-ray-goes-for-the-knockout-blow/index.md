The [news][1] [is][2] [everywhere][3]: Warner, the last remaining major studio to support both high def video formats in HD-DVD and Blu-Ray has announced that as of May they will support Blu-Ray exclusively.

Toshiba, owner of the HD-DVD patent? [Suprised][4]. And even better, Warner, unlike Universal when they went HD-DVD exclusive, [didn&#8217;t take a dime][5].

Even though both formats are burdened with DRM, I have to say I love my Blu-Ray player &#8211; it&#8217;s amazing the difference in HD. I&#8217;m glad I made the right call. Thanks Warner!
