The COVID-19 pandemic has changed a lot of things for a lot of people. One of the things it’s done to me is made it
harder to focus on my coding projects.  (Part of that is I’m very deadline driven, and well, no deadlines on personal
projects…)

Looking back on this year, I’ve actually accomplished a lot, but just not on the coding side. I’m just getting back to
it and I have two projects I’m going to make progress on. The first one is my music centric web app built with Pyramid
that interacts with my Discogs profile via the Discogs API. The second project involves a Raspberry Pi, but I’m much
better at the coding side of that than I am on the hardware side. (And that’s saying something with my novice coding
skills).
