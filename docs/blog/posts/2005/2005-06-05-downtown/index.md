This weekend, I headed to downtown Minneapolis twice, which I rarely do.

Friday night I visited [The Lounge][1], a bar in the Warehouse district to catch up with some work folk. This was one of the coolest bars I&#8217;ve been to in the Twin Cities. Before 10 or 11, they have a small area open near the front doors, with a bar, that turns into a bit of a dance floor later in the evening when it starts getting packed.

We were in the Cathedral room, a private room in the back, that adjoins the larger dance area & bar that opens after 11. The Catherdal room has faux stained glass ceilings, it&#8217;s own bar, DJ, and couches. The music was pumping, and a very good time was had.

Definitely worth a visit if you&#8217;ve never been there.
