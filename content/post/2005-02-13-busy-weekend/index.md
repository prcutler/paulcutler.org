  Mom & Dad came up to visit, with Dad coming up to box out the basement in preparation for getting the ceiling drywalled. Spent all of Saturday, and half of Sunday working in the basement getting the soffits built and put up.

Now it&#8217;s time to get some tinning done from the heating & cooling guys, finish off the electrical, get the insulation up and then have the drywallers in. Need to get it all done ASAP so we can get the drywallers in before the new housing construction season starts. 

It was a good way to finish off a fairly lazy vacation with some good old-fashioned hard work.

[See all the basement photos on my Flickr site][1].
