[Flickr][1] continues to amaze me. What did they do this time? If you had previously bought a Pro account, they [have announced][2] Pro users have been given a another year for free, and 2 Pro accounts to give away to friends. In addition, normal Flickr users have had their bandwidth and photo&#8217;s doubled, and Pro users have had their bandwidth doubled, and the price of a Pro account is now almost half of what it was last year.

I guess being bought by Yahoo was a good thing. God knows I&#8217;ve been very, very happy with Flickr, and this made my day.
