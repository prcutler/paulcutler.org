[Distrowatch Weekly is out][1], and the April 2nd edition has some kind words for the first [Foresight Newsletter][2]:

> It is always a pleasure to report that a project has gone out of its way to complement its distribution with additional material. Last week, Foresight Linux, an rPath-based desktop distribution with focus on the latest GNOME technologies, announced the launch of its new monthly newsletter: &#8220;The first Foresight Linux Newsletter has been released! The current edition reports about what&#8217;s happening with Foresight Linux, including information on the latest release, security updates, tips and tricks, what&#8217;s in development, and Foresight in the press.&#8221; Glancing through the first issue, this has to be one of the best distribution-specific newsletters available anywhere. Complete with a &#8220;Letter from the Editor&#8221;, a tip for ATI graphics card users, introduction to the Banshee music manager, the newsletter is well worth a read even if you are not a Foresight Linux user.

Thanks for the kind words, and now the bar has been set for future issues.

In other news, I&#8217;ve also updated the RSS feed for the Foresight Newsletter, you can subscribe using a feed I created in Feedburner. Just pop this in to your favorite RSS reader to subscribe: http://feeds.feedburner.com/foresightnewsletter (Just a bit easier than the other RSS feed, and a bit shorter).
