Ubuntu&#8217;s [sabdfl][1], Mark Shuttleworth, has [announced][2] the next Ubuntu release after 6.06 Dapper Drake will be the &#8220;Edgy Eft&#8221;.

What is an eft?

The exciting news in Edgy Eft, as posted in the announcement:

> And here&#8217;s why. Edgy is all about cutting edge, perhaps bleeding edge,
  
> brand new code and infrastructure. It will be the right time to bring in
  
> some seriously interesting but definitely edgy new technologies which
  
> lay the groundwork for the next wave of Ubuntu development.

One of the reasons that led to my break from my blogging habit over the last month or two was playing with Dapper Drake from Flight 2 on. I&#8217;ll post later on my thoughts on Dapper, but even the cutting edge stuff I was playing with, in what will be a Long Term Support release from Ubuntu was amazing &#8211; I could play with [XGL/Compiz][3] for hours.

I hope to see things like [Leaftag][4], [Gimmie][5], and many other goodies in Edgy Eft.
