      <description>It’s been two months since I was appointed to the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors to replace Behdad. (And those are some pretty big shoes to fill!)
With Foundation Board elections quickly approaching, we discussed at the last Board meeting this past Thursday sharing some of our experiences on the Board. We would like to encourage anyone with an interest in running for the Board to do so and I thought I’d share some of my experiences over the last 2 months and I believe other Board members will be sharing theirs as well.</description>
