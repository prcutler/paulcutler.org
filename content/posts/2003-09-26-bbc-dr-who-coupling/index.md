So the good news: The Daily Telegraph [is reporting][1] that the BBC is bringing back Dr. Who. That&#8217;s great news. It will be interesting to see if they use any CGI in it now &#8211; and let the debate begin on who the next Doctor will be.

And the bad news: Tried to watch Coupling last night. I lasted 5 minutes. It&#8217;s hard enough to get past the look of the actors being different from the BBC Coupling. The lines are the same &#8211; but they are delivered in such a different way.

I was impressed with the look of the set, very true to the original series. But the guy playing Jeff &#8211; one of the best things about the original Coupling is Jeff, not only the way he looks, but his quirkiness just seemed to be zapped out of him by the NBC version.

Ah well. Just can&#8217;t adapt to the change, I guess.
