It&#8217;s a long shot at best, but if the current collective bargaining agreement were to expire, and anti-trust rules go into place, EA could lose their exclusivity to the NFL players and teams come 2008.

[Gamersreports has the story][1].

I&#8217;ve meant to post a gigantic rant for some time on EA exclusive license to the NFL, as it relates to Madden for a long time. I wish I had when it was still relevant, and who knows, I still might.
