                <p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/10/angry_liberal_guy_ra.html">Via BoingBoing</a>, C.B. Shapiro has written an amazing piece of work, titled “<em>Hark, the Angry Liberal Sings</em>“. I’ll let his words explain, he does a much better job than I ever could, and I couldn’t agree with him more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thereâs been some <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-boehlert/on-lapdogs-and-richard-co_b_20729.html">ink spilled lately</a> denigrating so called âangry liberals,â that is, people who have allegedly lost their right to be taken seriously because they are âangry.â And they are âliberal.â</p>
<p>Well, I hereby declare myself a charter member in the ALC (Angry Liberal Club).</p>
<p>Sure, at first I felt guilty — what right do I have as a patriotic American to be angry? Or liberal? Oh, I tried to repress the âangry thing,â I tried — if I was asked, I claimed I was a âpeeved moderate.â Or a âmildly upset centrist.â But after much work through âBITâ (Blog Immersion Therapy), I stopped feeling the shame. Iâm coming out of the closet to announce I am an Angry Liberal Guy. And I am pissed.</p>
<p>You might be saying âMan, what are you so angry about, Angry Liberal Guy?â?</p>
<p>Iâve compiled a short (and by no means complete) list just so I could see it all in one place:</p>
<p>Iâm angry about the shredding of the constitutionâ¦illegal wiretapsâ¦falsified intelligenceâ¦secret prisonsâ¦ use of torture as an accepted means of interrogationâ¦Terry Schiavoâ¦the war on scienceâ¦denial of Global Warmingâ¦the fascistic secrecy of our elected officialsâ¦ presidential signings that declare the President above the lawâ¦the breakdown of the wall between church and stateâ¦the outing of a clandestine CIA agent for purely partisan political gainâ¦the corrupting influence of K Streetâ¦ the total sell-out of the legislative process to corporate interestsâ¦ appointments of unqualified cronies at every level of governmentâ¦Harriet Miersâ¦Brownieâ¦Abu Ghraibâ¦ Scooter â¦the complete mismanagement of the war in Iraqâ¦the lies about the complete mismanagement of the war in Iraqâ¦the grotesque budget deficitsâ¦ the pathetic response to Katrinaâ¦ a civil rights division dedicated to undermining civil rightsâ¦an environmental protection agency that refuses to protect the environmentâ¦ (Take a breath, Angry Liberal Guy.)</p>
<p>And Iâm angry about a smug, simple-minded, incompetent, unqualified President, and a press that denies the obvious fact that we have a smug, simple-minded, incompetent unqualified President.</p>
<p>If these things donât make you angry, I have to ask — what the hell is the matter with you?</p>
<p>And what would it take to make you angry? — C.B. Shapiro</p>
