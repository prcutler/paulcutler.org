When I blogged earlier this year that [The CircuitPython Show was over](https://www.paulcutler.org/posts/2024/07/one-door-closes-another-one-opens/), I really thought it was over.  But with the talk of [#CircuitPython2025](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/12/20/circuitpython-in-2025-circuitpython2025-python-circuitpython/) kicking off, I started to give the podcast some thought again.  And while I thought I had talked to most of the community members I wanted to talk to, there were still a few I hadn't reached out to yet.  

But where it really intrigued me, was what if it wasn't just an interview show and I sprinkled topic based episodes in as well?  I quickly brainstormed half a dozen ideas and realized there was more to do yet.  I reached out to a number of potential guests and the reponse was overwhelmingly positive.

I'm excited to share that The CircuitPython Show will return in mid-January.  It will still feature interviews with community members as well as topics including: how to design a PCB, building CircuitPython from source, creating games for CircuitPython, a panel interview about CircuitPython's new audio effects and filters, and more, with guests both new and returning.
