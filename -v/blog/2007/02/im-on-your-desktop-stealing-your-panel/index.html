<p>Neil Patel is doing some really innovative work with GNOME right now, from creating Avant Window Navigator to <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/tracker/">Tracker</a> to including <a href="http://njpatel.blogspot.com/2007/02/nautilus-love.html">metadata information in to Nautilus</a>.

<p>Back to Avant Window Navigator: AWN replaces one of your panels, and shows both what applications are open and a launcher for other applications.</p>
<p>I had some difficulty getting AWN installed even after reading <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=351186&amp;highlight=avant">this thread on Ubuntu Forums</a> and following the instructions on the <a href="http://awn.wetpaint.com/page/SVN+Version+Installation">AWN Wiki</a>. In the end, I was able to get it installed using Subversion, but I had to change one line from the wiki:</p>
<p>The wiki’s last step says:</p>
<p><code>cd data&lt;br /&gt; gconftool-2 --install-schema-file=avant-window-navigator.schemas</code></p>
<p>But there was no avant-window-navigator.schemas file in the /data directory. So I typed:</p>
<p><code>gconftool-2 --install-schema-file=avant-window-navigator.schemas.in</code></p>
<p>which <em>was</em> a file in the /data directory, and voila, AWN!</p>
<p>I made notes on the screenshot on Flickr, but on the left of the dock are the launcher applications, and on the 4 icons on the right side are the applications currently opened.</p>
<p>I removed the bottom panel once AWN was running, and moved my workspace switcher, show desktop button and trash icon to the panel at the top.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m quite impressed with AWN. It scales the icons beautifully, I like how they move when highlighted, and I love how it’s both a launcher and a switch application tool. Hats off to the developer for this one. It takes some getting used to not seeing a panel at the bottom of the screen after using GNOME all these years, but I have a feeling I’ll adjust.</p>
