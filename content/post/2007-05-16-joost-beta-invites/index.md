Do you need a Joost beta invite? I&#8217;ve hooked up all the friends (I think) who want one, and still have a bunch leftover.

Drop me an email at pcutler \_at\_ foresightlinux.org if you want one.

Mac & Windows only now, thought there have been rumors of a Linux client sometime in the future.

It&#8217;s definitely interesting &#8211; and different. Joost continues to sign up content partners, and it&#8217;s getting better each week. I don&#8217;t use it all that often as I&#8217;ve been mostly using my laptop now rather than my desktop, but when I am in my den, I&#8217;ll run it on my extra Windows box from time to time just as background noise and to keep tabs on what the Joost folks are up to.
