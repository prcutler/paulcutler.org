[The Kleptones][1], my favorite [mashup artists][2], have released a new 2-disc album: [24 Hours][3].

The torrents didn&#8217;t work for me listed on their webpage, but I used the Down Them All extension for Firefox and snapped up the MP3&#8217;s and burned &#8217;em to CD (don&#8217;t forget to burn without pauses between tracks!)

Enjoy!
