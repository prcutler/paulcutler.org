The must have game of 2006 for me is Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. With the Strogg invading Earth, the two sides do battle with unique classes, weapons and vehicles.

[The Enemy Territory website][1] has been updated from the placeholder it used to be.

And even better, [Gametrailers has the two and half minute trailer in high definition][2]. Watch it in your browser, or click on the link on the right and download the Windows Media or Quicktime HD versions.

Stunning &#8211; I don&#8217;t see myself ever playing Battlefield2 after this comes out, and with the already announced Linux support, I&#8221;ll be in heaven.
