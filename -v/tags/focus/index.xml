      <description>The Foresight Council, aka Focus, which holds bi-weekly meetings on Fridays, is opening the meetings to all community members! This topic was discussed at yesterday’s Focus meeting, and all three council members were unanimous in supporting it.
Get a peek of what’s going on inside Foresight, from current development, future development, sub-teams goings on, and community updates.
Here are the meeting notes from yesterday’s meeting, and we’ll see you in #foresight-council on Freenode IRC at our next meeting on June 6th at 9 a.</description>
