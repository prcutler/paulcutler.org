Speaking of Yahoo Radio yesterday, what a disappointing service.

From a broadcast perspective, it&#8217;s gotten better. It used to be when they cut to commercial, it was dead air with no sound. Now you get local commercials.

But I&#8217;m a geek &#8211; I use Red Hat 9 on the box I listen to the game on. Well, doesn&#8217;t work with Linux. Fine. Use the KVM and pull up the other Windows box. Fire up Mozilla Firebird and go back and try and load it and Yahoo tells me I&#8217;m not running the right OS again. Takes me a few minutes to realize that I&#8217;m running the right OS, just not the right browser. Fire up IE, and bam, get the popup to choose RealOne or WMP as my player. Their OS / player detection page needs to define better the problem. And they should at least be Mozilla compliant. (Hmm, just thought of putting the plugin information in for WMP, but I don&#8217;t think that would fix it anyway).

And how about those Colts last night? By the definition of the Leaping rule as Al Michaels read on TV, Simeon Rice did break the rule &#8211; even if he landed late. But even to that point, for the Colts to score 3 TDs in 3:44, on the **Bucs Defense**, is amazing.

Sitting around watching the game last night, we all looked at each other and said this was a defining moment for Peyton Manning &#8211; and it was. Good for Dungy, especially after how the Glazers screwed him.
