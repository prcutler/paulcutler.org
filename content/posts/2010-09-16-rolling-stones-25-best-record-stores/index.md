Rolling Stone released their list of the [25 best record stores][1] in the United States yesterday.

Minneapolis was well represented with [Electric Fetus][2] coming in as the sixth best record store in the U.S. and [Hymie&#8217;s Vintage Records][3] rounded out the list at twenty-five.

In July I went on a bit of a shopping spree at Electric Fetus, which is also where I spent Record Store Day 2009.  There is no question that Electric Fetus has one of, if not the best, selection in the Twin Cities, though [Cheapo][4] gives them a pretty strong run for selection.  I have to say I was disappointed in the service at Electric Fetus in July.  I asked two different clerks questions about the vinyl I was buying and both times they couldn&#8217;t answer my question (and they weren&#8217;t hard questions &#8211; it&#8217;s not like I was trying to play stump the clerk).

I&#8217;m embarrassed to admit I hadn&#8217;t heard of Hymies until now &#8211; I definitely know where my next round of shopping is going to be!
