The first ever (that we know of) conference for documentation writers in open source conference started today in Owen Sound, Ontario (about 2 hours from Toronto). The [Writing Open Source][1] conference is being hosted by Emma Jane Hogbin, and a few of us from GNOME are here:

We&#8217;re halfway through the first day, which is keynotes, and the conference is awesome.

Some random thoughts:

  * How cool is it that all of our keynote speakers are women? And our conference overall is 50% women / 50% men.
  * Lots of different projects are represented, including BSD, Drupal, GNOME, XFCE and more.
  * The keynotes are great. All of us have pages of notes, either on paper, in Tomboy or insert your favorite text editor.
  * A quarter of attendees have netbooks. There&#8217;s a couple of Macs, and the rest of us are on laptops with Linux. I haven&#8217;t seen one Windows laptop yet.
  * Experience ranges from published authors to one individual who&#8217;s never contributed but wants to learn.

Belinda from Canonical is talking now, and she has goodies and exercises for us to do, so I have to run. More to come. You can follow along on Twitter or identi.ca with the #woscon09 hash tag too.
