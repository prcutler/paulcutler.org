It&#8217;s quite fitting the day after I launched the blog that the most beautiful record I&#8217;ve purchased yet should be delivered.

[of Montreal][2] has released a 12&#8243; album on the [Polyvinyl][3] label of [The Past is a Grotesque Animal][4], originally recorded for Spike Jonze&#8217;s I&#8217;M HERE.  It comes on light blue vinyl with a hand screen printed design by Nina / Geminitactics.

Polyvinyl is a small label out of Champaign, Illinois and features a number of indie artists that I&#8217;ve been lucky to hear on my local radio station, 89.3 The Current.  Polyvinyl is home to of Montreal, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin, Joan of Arc and is the former home for Mates of State.  Last year they had a bit of financial trouble, and [using Kickstarter they had a sale][5] to save 10,000 records from destruction.  For only $20 I received 8 CDs that served as a great introduction to the artists on their label.

of Montreal was one of those artists I received a further introduction too, receiving their _Icons, Abstract Thee_ CD.  Kevin Barnes is the man behind the project, having released 9 of Montreal albums, with the tenth coming out later this year (and [available via pre-sale now][6].  And yes, I pre-ordered the limited edition red LP package).

_The Past is a Grotesque_ record features two versions of the song, the second with The Lost Trees.  The song features of Montreal&#8217;s trademark catchiness and is also haunting in a way &#8211; but the vocals are like nothing done on an of Montreal record before.

I&#8217;ve listened to it a few times, and while it may not be my favorite song by of Montreal, it&#8217;s probably the favorite record I&#8217;ve purchased so far.  The record is a beautiful sky blue and the picture below doesn&#8217;t do it justice.

This is the first vinyl record I&#8217;ve purchased from Polyvinyl, but it won&#8217;t be the last.  I already have pre-orders in for of Montreal&#8217;s next album, False Priest, and Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin&#8217;s August release Let it Sway.  Polyvinyl, and more importantly, their artists get how the music industry is changing &#8211; you can order the CD or LP &#8211; both with the album in MP3 available on release date,  as well as packages containing t-shirts, buttons or stickers.  It&#8217;s good to see at least one label who understands [CwF + RtB (Connect with Fans) + (Reason to Buy)][8].  And they sent me some bonus items with my of Montreal purchase:  The ZZZZ&#8217;s latest album, a poster and a pink lemonade Airheads!
