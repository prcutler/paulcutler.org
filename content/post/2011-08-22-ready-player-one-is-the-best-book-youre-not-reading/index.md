If you grew up in the 80s like me, especially as a teenager, [Ready Player One][1] is a book for you.

For fans of retro arcade games, 80s music and movies, MMOs, cyberpunk, roleplaying and early computers like the TRS-80, it weaves them all into a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

I can&#8217;t do it justice, so [read the summary here][2].  And then buy it and read it, you won&#8217;t be disappointed.
