I was surprised in the mail about a week and a half ago, when out of the blue I received:

[<img src="https://i1.wp.com/photos22.flickr.com/26690996_81e4e1b1fb.jpg?resize=500%2C171" width="500" height="171" alt="eff-sticker" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]

I had re-upped my membership with the EFF in May, like I have for the last few years, and I was delighted to receive the bumper sticker, especially as I wasn&#8217;t expecting it. It was a nice touch, as was the accompanying letter.

Once I get this basement finished (someday), I&#8217;m going to have Kelly build me a shadow box to put that in, along with the silver membership sticker and letter I received when I first joined. It&#8217;s probably best to frame it, as I&#8217;m looking to sell my car in the next year or so.
