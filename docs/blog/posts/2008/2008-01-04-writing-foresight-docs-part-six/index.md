It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve written (or written about) Foresight Documentation.

Work has resumed on getting the Userguide to 1.0, with commits happening on almost a nightly basis (except last night, as I reinstalled the Foresight alpha on my laptop, but I did work on screenshots).

The main focus is removing all mentions of the (now deprecated) Foresight System Manager and replacing them with information on how to use PackageKit.

The secondary goal is to close all outstanding [bugs and tasks against the userguide][1]. Once all bugs are complete, I will call the Userguide 1.0 and start work on 2.0. Unfortunately, I had always hoped to add more pages to the userguide, such as expanding how to burn an ISO and pages on X-Chat and Liferea, but those will probably only be in 2.0.

Userguide 2.0 will be created in a new Mercurial repository, and be set up to provide documentation for all editions, including GNOME, KDE and XFCE. (Alphabetical, not in order of personal preference, really!) In addition to the new pages mentioned above, I hope to have more timely updates, as well making it easy for people to add content, and maybe a whole section just devoted to development. Yup, it&#8217;s time to take it to the next level!

Docs can&#8217;t be a one person show, so help me make documentation on Foresight a thing of beauty. I&#8217;ve created a [mailing list at Google Groups][2] to discuss docs &#8211; I&#8217;d love to hear any thoughts anyone has on what documentation should be included, and would also love some more volunteers to truly make documentation something that lives and breathes with frequent updates.
