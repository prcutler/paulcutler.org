One of the things I&#8217;ve been enjoying as I took a blogging break (that&#8217;s over, I swear!) is enjoying Album Club. What is Album Club, you ask? Every Tuesday night at 9 p.m. CDT, listeners gather on Twitter and listen to the same album and tweet their thoughts, remembrances and more about the album. The tweets range from information about the recording of the album to humor to scathing criticism.

The album is picked out a few days before and announced on the [Album Club blog][1]. Follow [Album Club on Twitter][2] as well as the #albumclub hashtag and at 9pm Tuesdays the tweets roll in!

Album Club is hosted by [Steve Nelson][3], former morning co-host at Rev105 in the 90&#8217;s, former music director at 8[9.3 The Current][4], and now news director at [Minnesota Public Radio][5]. Mr. Nelson picks the albums and hosts the session each Tuesday. Since Album Club started in April, the albums listened to and tweeted about include:

  * Pixies &#8211; Doolittle
  * Radiohead &#8211; OK Computer
  * Bjork &#8211; Post
  * Prince and the Revolution &#8211; Purple Rain (hosted live Aster Cafe)
  * Marvin Gaye &#8211; What&#8217;s Going On
  * Fleetwood Mac &#8211; Rumours

Last night&#8217;s Rumours session was guest curated by [John Moe][6] &#8211; and a good time was had by all as Mr. Moe shared background on the album, the challenges Fleetwood Mac was going through when they recorded this classic, and his disdain for Christine McVie.

See you Tuesdays at 9pm!
