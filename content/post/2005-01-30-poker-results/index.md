Kento was the big winner last night in our first monthly poker tournament.

It was quite fun, we made a few mistakes here and there, and a few people bet big early to get out more than anything, but I think it&#8217;s safe to say a good time was had by all.

Liquor flowed freely, food was consumed, and money exchanged hands. How can it get any better! ðŸ™‚

I&#8217;ll do a recap of how I did later. For now, [all the photo&#8217;s from Fri. night are here on my Flickr site][1].
