Dear Lazyweb,

I&#8217;m working on the [privacy policy for Tomboy Online][1] and I&#8217;m looking for examples of good privacy polices.

Users will have the ability keep their notes private or share them with other users and as the GNOME Snowy server will be hosting all of the data we will want to have a privacy policy in place.

If you know of a website or web service with a good privacy please comment or drop me an email. Thanks in advance!
