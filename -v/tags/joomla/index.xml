      <description>It’s been just over a year since we rolled out the new Foresight website, which is written in HTML.
After some on and off debate, we’ve made the decision to switch to a CMS (which makes it much easier to get volunteers involved), and as of last night we’ve picked Joomla over Drupal.
We’ve set up our appliance on rBuilder, and we’re looking for help in building and maintaining the appliance, and even more important in designing a Joomla template for the look and feel of the new Foresightlinux.</description>
