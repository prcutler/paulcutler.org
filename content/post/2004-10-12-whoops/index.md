Patched my [version of WordPress][1], forgot the kids. Will do that tomorrow.

Have to think about creating flickr accounts for them. Or finding some really, really good Gallery hacks, but man Flickr has blown me away.

Except I went and used all my bandwidth this month. Whoops, need to blog pictures this weekend still.
