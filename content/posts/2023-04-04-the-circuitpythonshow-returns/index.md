After being on hiatus since December, I'm happy to share that The CircuitPython Show returns this coming Monday, April 10th.

I've got some great guests lined up, including authors, board designers, developers, and more.  

Make sure you're subscribed in your favorite podcast app and the new episode will hit your earbuds this Monday!

Thanks for listening.
