For my first day of vacation, I took Alex and Zoe to the Twins game at the Metrodome. It was Alex&#8217;s first Twins game, and Zoe&#8217;s first baseball game as we watched the Twins take on the Blue Jays. We had the use of a suite, just to the left behind home plate, with a gorgeous view of the field:

Zoe and Alex seemed to have fun, Zoe enjoyed being able to run around the suite, and both kids enjoyed all the foods and snacks.

(My batteries were low, so I don&#8217;t think the flash worked).

After the baseball strike in the early 90&#8217;s, I swore off all baseball. It wasn&#8217;t until last year where I started to have an interest again, mostly due to the Twins being such a quality organization, both in management and the players. They play baseball as it was meant to be played, as a team, without ego, and truly appear to have fun. That has translated in to 4 AL Central Division championships in the last 5 years, and I&#8217;ve found myself watching a lot of games this year. It doesn&#8217;t change the fact the Metrodome is a terrible baseball experience &#8211; baseball should always be played outdoors!

The game started out rough, with Frank Thomas basting a 3 run homer in the first inning to give the Blue Jays a 4 &#8211; 0 lead. It was Frank Thomas&#8217; 500th home run, as he became only the 21st player in MLB history to achieve that milestone, and the Twins fans rewarded him with a standing ovation. The Twins scraped an clawed led by Torii Hunter&#8217;s two home runs to take the lead with a nice come from behind win.
