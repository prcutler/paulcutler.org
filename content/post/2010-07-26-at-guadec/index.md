I&#8217;m a bad blogger &#8211; for the last two weeks I&#8217;ve been telling myself to write a nice &#8220;I&#8217;m going to GUADEC&#8221; post on my blog, but here I am already at GUADEC with only excuses why I didn&#8217;t. I blame Vincent!

But I&#8217;m here at GUADEC and we had a good Board meeting &#8211; it was good to see some faces I haven&#8217;t seen in a while and meet new ones. I spent most of today (had to leave a bit early to fix my phone) in the Open Desktop Day learning about large deployments of GNOME around the world. 

Last year was my first GUADEC, which still is mostly a blur. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing everyone again and would love to chat &#8211; just grab me (assuming I&#8217;m not already talking to somebody!) and I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts about how GNOME is doing, what you&#8217;re working (or I&#8217;m working on!), GNOME 3.0 or anything that else comes to mind.
