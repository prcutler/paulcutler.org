A few anniversaries:

  * Last month was 5 years of blogging. Wow! From your basic blog / diary, to more tech and copyright oriented, to almost all Linux all the time, it&#8217;s been quite a journey. I&#8217;m sure my friends will give me even more crap about it now.
  * Last month marks 9 years since I first installed Red Hat 5.2 that I bought right after Christmas. (I still own the original box and CD). Next month will be my 3 year anniversary of being exclusive with Linux. Don&#8217;t miss Windows one bit. Get my gaming fix via Xbox 360 and Wii these days.
  * I&#8217;m a year older this Saturday. I&#8217;m now leaving the coveted 25-34 demographic. Sigh.

I&#8217;m off to Los Angeles first thing in the morning, and working out there this week. So if you don&#8217;t see me in IRC or blogging, now you know why. This weekend I will be at [SCALE][1] at the Los Angeles Airport Westin. You&#8217;ll be able to find in the bright green t-shirt. Someone buy me a drink on Saturday.
