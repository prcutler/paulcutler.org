Gizmodo covers what&#8217;s been on my mind since it was announced Apple&#8217;s iPhone partner was AT&T: the [moral quandary of doing business with AT&T][1].:

> So what we have is a company that doesn&#8217;t have privacy at the top of its priority list, not to mention the [anti-trust laws][2] of this country. It&#8217;s [setting terrible precedents left and right][3], and its vast power that comes from its huge size makes it all the more unlikely to change for the better. We, as contentious, tech-savvy individuals, should go out of our way to deprive this company of money, power, and influence. 

And for more information about AT&T, [visit the EFF&#8217;s page][4].

The above paragraph sums up exactly why I won&#8217;t buy, or even consider, an iPhone.
