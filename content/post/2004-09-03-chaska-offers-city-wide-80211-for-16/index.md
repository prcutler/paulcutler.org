The [Minneapolis Star Tribune][1] has an article this morning about the city of Chaska&#8217;s wireless broadband service for $16. Discussed previously in USA Today and [Slashdot][2], I&#8217;ve looked into it, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s for me.

It&#8217;s more than half off of Sprint DSL, and almost 2/3 less than Time Warner&#8217;s Roadrunner service. I&#8217;ve had Roadrunner since it launched in Chaska 4 years ago, and it&#8217;s been rock steady. I used to average 2.5 megs down, and recently they upped it to 3.5 down. With Chaska.net offering 800k &#8211; 1.2 megs down, the reliability, but more importantly (as a gamer) the speed of RR will keep me with RR&#8217;s service.

Chaska.net does give me hope for the future, as more cities in the U.S. adopt this model and can make broadband affordable for everyone.
