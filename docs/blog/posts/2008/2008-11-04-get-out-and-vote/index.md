If you live in the U.S., today is the day. After almost 2 years of campaigning and listening to the candidates, it&#8217;s our turn as citizens to make our decisions and vote for our candidates.

I voted an hour ago &#8211; and the turnout was higher than 4 years ago, and I live in the state with the highest percentage of registered voters and those who vote. We had more voting booths than I&#8217;ve seen in 10 years of living here.

The best part? In Minnesota you can register to vote on election day, and vote. There were 6 people registering to vote, all, I would guess, under the age of 25. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. For years the younger demographic has had the lowest turnout &#8211; I hope what I saw wasn&#8217;t just a fluke, and the young voters turn out today, and keep voting for the rest of their lives.

Please vote today. Every vote _does_ make a difference.
