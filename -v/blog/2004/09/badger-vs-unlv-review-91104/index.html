                <p>The Wisconsin Badgers hosted John Robinson’s UNLV football team at Camp Randall yesterday.</p>
<p>Looking at the history of these two teams, once again it was another strange game. Two years ago UNLV’s stadium suffered from power outages during the game, and last year UNLV stomped the Badgers 23-5 as the Badgers only scored on a field goal and a safety.</p>
<p>Bob Davie, former Notre Dame coach, and current color commentator for ESPN was eerily prophetic when in the first quarter he references last year’s safety by Wisconsin as UNLV is once again preparing ot punt from within their 5. Davie comments that UNLV won’t have forgotten tomorrow and may be nervous as the ball is hiked promptly sails over the punters head for a Badger safety.</p>
<p>Badger’s led for most of the first half 2-0, after missing 2 field goals early, including one from the 10, and a failed 4th and 1 from the Badgers 2. Badgers proceeded to score on a blocked UNLV field goal for a touchdown by Jim Leohnard and another safety. The only other scores were a field goal by UNLV and a later Badger touchdown.</p>
<p>All in all, it was kind of painful to watch, especially the first half. You would think a game featuring 2 safeties and a blocked FG for touchdown would be exciting, but the Badgers lack of offensive power was disturbing. True freshman running back Walker shows promise, but Booker Stanley is no Anthony Davis, and until Davis returns from an eye injury, the Badgers could have some trouble. QB John Stocco in his first year starting looks fairly good, with Owen Daniels and Brandon Williams being favortie targets.</p>
<p>Two games into the season, I’ve been pleasantly suprised with the UW defense. Led by a new defensive coordinator, they haven’t done anything flashy or given up really big plays, but solid and consistent play in and play out.</p>
<p>Next week: @ Arizona.</p>
