[Minnesota Public Radio&#8217;s][1] music station, [89.3 The Current][2] has launched a [group blog called the Current Cue][3] for their DJ&#8217;s.

One of the more interesting posts so far, [their computer which houses all the music][4] crashed. Apparently they rip all their CDs to PC to play on the air. Interesting story on what happened.

It makes me wonder though &#8211; if they&#8217;re playing music over the air digitally, what format are they using? It has to be a lossless codec, and there are only a few of those that would work. FLAC? SHN? Windows Media Lossless? Or do they just rip it straight to wav? I wonder what kind of RAID redundancy they have set up for something like that.
