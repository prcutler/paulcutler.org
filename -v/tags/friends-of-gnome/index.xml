      <description>Later this week, I have the opportunity, along with Shaun McCance, Phil Bull and Milo Casagrande, to attend the Writing Open Source conference, which is thought to be the first conference to be focused on open source and documentation. We will have keynotes on Friday, an unconference on Saturday, and a GNOME documentation hackfest on Sunday.
GNOME is sponsoring four of us to go from a donation by Intel. Each of us is paying the conference fee out of pocket, and GNOME has subsidized our airfare and lodging (I paid for my own airfare).</description>
