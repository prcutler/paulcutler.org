I've spent this week watching some videos and preparing for today when I'm going to make a practice cut for the first time using the circular saw and jigsaw.  The hardest part is figuring out the curve of the cut for the side panel.  The Geek Pub FAQ says this is explained in the video for the mini bartop.  I just watched that video - and it's not explained at all!  Even worse, the 10 seconds where it is explained is not applicable to the full size cabinet at all, in my opinion.  I showed Kelly and she said she'll help me, but I'll have to wait until her midterms are over this week.  That's fair and I'll keep watching videos to learn some best practices.  (Seriously, what did we ever do before YouTube?!)
