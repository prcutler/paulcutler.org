[Martin Pitt mentions in his latest blog post][1] that it took only 4 hours to get a GNOME git account after requesting it.

And that&#8217;s all do to the work of one person: [Andrea Veri][2].

I&#8217;ve done some poking around on the status of the [Accounts Team][3] and whether it&#8217;s active or not, but after Jeff Schroeder on the Sysadmin team sponsored Andrea last month, Andrea joined to help out specifically with GNOME Accounts and has done an awesome job. He&#8217;s cleaned up Request Tracker, stayed on top of new requests, and helped with some outstanding and older requests. (And a big thanks to Olav and Jeff and everyone who has helped mentor Andrea).

I can&#8217;t thank Andrea enough for all of his help and chances are if you&#8217;ve requested git access, mango password resets or anything else Accounts related in the last month, it was Andrea helping you.
