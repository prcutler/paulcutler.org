      <description>After a two year break, I signed up for Netflix again. Towards the end of my last subscription, I was paying $15 / month to hang on to two or three DVDs I never got around to watching. I’m the type of customer Netflix loves – really active, then a couple months of inactivity.
To curb my habit of buying Blu-Ray movies (they’re so pretty in HD!), I signed up again yesterday.</description>

      <description>The news is everywhere: Warner, the last remaining major studio to support both high def video formats in HD-DVD and Blu-Ray has announced that as of May they will support Blu-Ray exclusively.
Toshiba, owner of the HD-DVD patent? Suprised. And even better, Warner, unlike Universal when they went HD-DVD exclusive, didn’t take a dime.
Even though both formats are burdened with DRM, I have to say I love my Blu-Ray player – it’s amazing the difference in HD.</description>
