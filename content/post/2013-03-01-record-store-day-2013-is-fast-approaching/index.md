We are only 49 days away from [Record Store Day 2013][1], to be held on April 19th.

Support your local record store and get some cool, limited edition releases. The official records to be released isn&#8217;t out yet, but some sites are up with the [leaked lists.][2] Other than the Mad Season re-release, I haven&#8217;t seen a lot that I&#8217;m personally interested, but there are enough records coming out to make everyone happy.

Want to learn more? Watch Jack White, this year&#8217;s Record Store Day Ambassador, to learn more.
