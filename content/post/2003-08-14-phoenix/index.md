Just got back from a business trip in Phoenix.

Holy crap is it hot.

Hit the road at 6:30 a.m. and it&#8217;s already 90 degrees.

Heard on the news that the old record of 6 days in the year where it didn&#8217;t drop below 90 was shattered this year &#8211; 15 days total.

I need to go back in Dec / Jan when it&#8217;s cold here and warm there.

But the resort we stayed at was extremely nice &#8211; off-peak in season it was quite cheap.
