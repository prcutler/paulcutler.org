# The CircuitPython Show

The [The CircuitPython Show](https://www.circuitpythonshow.com) is an independent podcast with the people in and around the CircuitPython community. The show features a short interview with community members asking how they first became involved with computing or electronics, a topic, and wrap-up question.

The show debuted with weekly episodes in March 2022. With the start of season two April 2022, the show moved to a bi-weekly schedule.  Guests have included Kattni Rembor, Scott Shawcroft, Nicholas Tollervey, and more.
