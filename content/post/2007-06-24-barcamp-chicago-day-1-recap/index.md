Barcamp Chicago has been a blast. Saturday&#8217;s turnout was phenomenal &#8211; I would hazard a guess we had 200 people at one point. The formal presentation was always packed, and mini-sessions were going on all around.

There hasn&#8217;t been a lot of hacking per se, but lots of active discussions about everything from road trips to Linux distributions to brewing (and trying!) home brewed beer. I could have done some more networking, but overall, I am having a blast.

Unfortunately, my camera isn&#8217;t working on my PC or Ken&#8217;s &#8211; I&#8217;m getting USB errors when trying to import the photos, so those will have to wait until I get home to a card reader.

Ken&#8217;s been a big hit &#8211; lots of folks who have not only heard of Conary, but wanted to learn more, and he&#8217;s been in his environment talking away, and his passion and excitement has rubbed off on everyone around him.

We got back to the hotel around 5 a.m., so to say it was a fun-filled day, was an understatement.
