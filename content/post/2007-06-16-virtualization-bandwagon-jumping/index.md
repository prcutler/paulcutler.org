I decided to jump on the bandwagon and tried out my first appliances today, using the free VMWare player, and a couple of appliances from [rpath.org][1].

Working on Foresight, a number of the images published are for various virtualization technolgies, such as VMWare, Parallels and Xen. Following the [VMWare installation instructions in the Wiki][2], I installed VMWare on Foresight 1.3, downloaded 2 appliances, and was up and running in about 5 minutes.

I am starting to see why these are all the rage right now (at the last [TCLUG][3] meeting, a lot of folks put Virtualization on the list for a future speaker to come talk about). From using an image for testing, to installing multiple appliances on a server for specific applications, there are some pretty cool use cases that become possible.

And yes, I know I&#8217;m late to the party on this topic, but better late than never. ðŸ™‚

Here&#8217;s a screenshot of [Openfiler][4], a NAS appliance running in a VMWare player:

And here is a screenshot of Openfiler running, and a [WordPress-Multiuser appliance][6] just starting to boot up:
