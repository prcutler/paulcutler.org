Over thirty years later, Blade Runner still remains one of my favorite films ([as I&#8217;ve][1] [previously][2] [blogged][3] [about][4]).  It was only six weeks ago that I sat down and watched it again &#8211; it is easily one of the movies I can watch over and over and still enjoy with a sense of wonder.

I&#8217;m not the only one who shares a passion for Blade Runner, as fans have paid tribute to the classic film in a few ways in 2013:

Blade Runner: 8 Bit Cinema &#8211; here is the film re-told as a classic video game.  If only this was a real game! ([Via Gizmodo][5])

[Moments Lost: Music and Art inspired by Blade Runner][6]. This is an IndieGoGo campaign to create a full length soundtrack using Vangelis&#8217; original recording equipment. (Vangelis did the original soundtrack to the film). It will also include 8 stories and 8 illustrations as part of the fundraising campaign.

Lastly, here is Blade Runner done as 12,000 hand painted water color paintings.  As [Rob Beschizza of Boing Boing wrote][7]:

> The _absolutely stunning_ work of [Swedish artist Anders Ramsell][8], who painted each frame as a 1.5 x 3cm work of art. It&#8217;s taken him a while to complete the epic job; Pesco [wrote about the first three minutes][9] last year. The end result runs about 30 minutes, which is exactly how long _Blade Runner_ should be.
