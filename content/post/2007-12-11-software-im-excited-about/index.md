A brief post as I&#8217;m still traveling for work. Here are a couple big and small packages in development that I&#8217;m excited about:

  * [Flyback][1]: A GUI wrapper for rsync and rsnapshot to make backup easier, that is often compared to Apple&#8217;s Time Machine. It&#8217;s a python script that creates a GUI for the user and makes it simple to create and schedule backups of a user&#8217;s directories and files. Choose which directory, files, hidden files, and it sends the back up to a directory of your choosing. It&#8217;s still very early in development, and I didn&#8217;t see a way to send a backup to a network share that&#8217;s mounted in GNOME. But I believe most users don&#8217;t backup enough, and for a distribution like that Foresight, that &#8220;just works&#8221;, backup should be added to the list of things that just work for a user.
  * [GNOME-DO][2]: A Quicksilver-like application that is difficult to explain, but can increase your productivity ten fold by making it easy to quickly open applications, jump between open windows and more. See [more at Download Squad including a video][3] of GNOME-Do in action.
  * [Publishr][4], a small one, but looks useful, Publishr adds a &#8220;publish&#8221; plug-in to GIMP to make it easy to send your images to Picasa or Flickr. Sure, F-Spot has had this feature forever, but there are a lot of times when I&#8217;m editing a screenshot that I want to send to Flickr that I won&#8217;t put in my F-Spot library, and this plugin will help skip a step by having to use Flickr&#8217;s web upload feature.

I&#8217;m definitely going to keep an eye on these applications, and may add to my Foresight repository when I get some time.
