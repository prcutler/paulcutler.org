Took Alex to his first college football game yesterday, Badgers vs Gophers at the Metrodome. Gophers won on a last second field goal, but Alex had a ball. Pretty good seats, corner end zone, upper deck, so we had a nice clear view of the field.

I had as much fun watching Alex and his reactions to the game as I did watching the game. Great football game (even if the wrong team won) &#8211; Badgers stormed back in the second half, Alvarez had a gutsy time out call on the Gophers last drive, but it wasn&#8217;t meant to be. 

Didn&#8217;t even realize until today when I was reading the sports page that the Gopher&#8217;s starting QB got hurt.

Great time, will have to do that again with Alex. <img src='https://i0.wp.com/www.silwenae.net/blogs/img/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif?w=700' alt='&#58;&#68;' class='middle' data-recalc-dims="1" />
