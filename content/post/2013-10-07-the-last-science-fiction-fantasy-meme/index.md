[SF Signal][1], the most recent [Hugo award winning fanzine][2], posted a meme on Saturday with a &#8220;last&#8221; theme.  Here we go:

  1. The last sf/f book I finished reading: [_Shift Omnibus_][3] by Hugh Howey
  2. The last sf/f book I did NOT finish: _Perdido Street Station_ by China Miéville (I loved _The City & the City_ but just could not finish this one.  It&#8217;s very rare for me to not finish a book.)
  3. The last sf/f book(s) I bought: [_Ancillary Justice_][4] by Ann Leckie
  4. The last sf/f book I bought that I already owned: _[Reamde][5]_ by Neal Stephenson (I buy all of his books in hardcover and Amazon had the Kindle version for $2.  Couldn&#8217;t resist).
  5. The last sf/f book I shared with someone: _A Game of Thrones_ (a co-worker is sucked into the TV series and wanted to read the books.  He agrees the books are even better, as good as the HBO series is).
  6. The last sf/f book I raved about: _Ancillary Justice_ &#8211; I just started reading it this weekend and am [already raving][6] about it.  We&#8217;ll see how the end is.
  7. The last sf/f book I did not enjoy at all: [_There Goes the Galaxy_][7] by Jenn Thorson.  It was another Kindle deal for free or a buck.  If you look at the reviews, it has 33 5 star reviews and 21 4 star reviews (54 out of 61 reviews).  It was trite, the writing wasn&#8217;t all that great and you could see the end coming a mile away.  It tried way too hard to be in the vein of _The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy_ and just didn&#8217;t pull it off.

If you&#8217;re not reading [SFSignal][8], you should be &#8211; it&#8217;s worth it for the daily round-up of links to discounted and free eBooks alone.  There is a very good reason they won the Hugo for best Fanzine this year.
