[&#8220;Alias,&#8221; AKA Canceled &#8211; Nov 23, 2005 &#8211; E! Online News][1] is the headline of a story over at E! Online. In a shock to no one, ABC has pulled the plug on Alias after 5 seasons.

I still hadn&#8217;t made up my mind on how this season was going &#8211; last year I jumped to conclusions way to early, and it turned out to be one of the better ones. Though little things still bugged me this season, I was willing to go along with it.

> Alias executive producer Jeff Pinkner said in a statement that the crew was &#8220;very saddened to face reality that Alias is coming to an end.&#8221; He promised a &#8220;surprising&#8221; and &#8220;thrilling&#8221; finale.

The worst part of that article? One little blurb at the bottom that reports CBS has pulled the plug on Threshold as well. I was really into Threshold in it&#8217;s inaugural season. Poor Carla Gugino, Karen Sisco on ABC didn&#8217;t work out, and now this.
