This year marks ten years of charitable giving for me to the [Electronic Frontier Foundation][2]. The EFF is by far my favorite charity that we give to each year and I can&#8217;t stress enough how important the work they do is.

A number of years ago my wife framed my letters and stickers I&#8217;ve received from my favorite non-profit organizations (pictured above) including the [EFF][2], [Creative Commons][3] and [Minnesota Public Radio][4].

Who is the EFF and why is it important? From their [About page][5]:

> When our freedoms in the networked world come under attack, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is the first line of defense. EFF broke new ground when it was founded in 1990—well before the Internet was on most people&#8217;s radar—and continues to confront cutting-edge issues defending free speech, privacy, innovation, and consumer rights today. From the beginning, EFF has championed the public interest in every critical battle affecting digital rights.

While most of America was shocked at Edward Snowden&#8217;s revelations this year about the NSA spying, EFF supporters have known about the NSA&#8217;s taps on the internet for years &#8211; it was in January, 2006 when Mark Klein became a whistle blower, sharing with the EFF information about the NSA internet taps at AT&T. ([The full timeline of NSA spying][6] is staggering).

This is just one of many important projects that EFF works on to protect our digital rights. [Check them out with the full list][7]:

A few examples:

  * [Bloggers&#8217; Rights][8]
  * [Coders&#8217; Rights][9]
  * [Patent Busting][10]
  * [Teaching Copyright][11]

Their work is important. [Support them][12] and support your digital freedom.
