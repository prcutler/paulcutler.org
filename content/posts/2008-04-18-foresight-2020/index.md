My flight got in late last night, and Ken was kind enough to pick me up from the airport, where I met pscott and doniphon face to face for the first time.

After a snafu at the hotel (long story for a different time), we are hanging out at the rPath offices. Walk in to their office and you know exactly where you are, this is on the wall:

I&#8217;ve met tons of people today so far, including devnet, stef, elliot, Og, Up2, mkj and more.

pscott and I are hanging in an extra office while the others have to work, waiting for some other folks flights to get in.

You should have come to the Foresight 20/20 conference, you&#8217;d get one of these:

I&#8217;ll try to keep up with photos and blog posts throughout the weekend.

(Sorry about the blurry photos, it&#8217;s the camera, I swear!)
