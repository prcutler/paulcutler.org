                <p>It’s that time of year to start thinking about the GNOME Annual report and recapping all the wonderful activities the GNOME community has been involved in over the past year.</p>
<p>Lucas has done an <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/lucasr/2008/10/30/gnome-annual-report-2008-kickoff/">awesome</a> <a href="http://foundation.gnome.org/reports/gnome-annual-report-2008.pdf">job</a> over the last few years and this year has asked me to help with coordinating the annual report.</p>
<p>The annual report is one of the first things I ever contributed to GNOME (as an editor) and I hope I can do as good a job as Lucas has done.</p>
<p>With that said, we need your help! As I mentioned in the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/marketing-list/2009-October/msg00001.html">kickoff email</a>, we need help with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this the right format? Are these the right sections?</li>
<li>Writers! Want to write one of these sections? Grab it! Want to write something not listed? Add it and write it!</li>
<li>Editors. Good editing is as important as good writing.</li>
<li>Artwork and layout.</li>
<li>High res photos of GNOME community members.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have ideas for articles that should be included, links and information for the authors, or any new ideas, please let me know or feel free to <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeMarketing/AnnualReport/AnnualReport2009">edit the GNOME Annual Report 2009 wiki page</a>!</p>
<p>And just like Lucas has done in past years, don’t be surprised if I reach out to you individually to help.</p>
