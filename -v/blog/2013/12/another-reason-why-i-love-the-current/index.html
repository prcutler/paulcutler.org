I vividly remember the day Rev105 changed formats. My wife and I were leaving work and climbed into the car in the carpool lot. Turning on the car, Van Halen was playing. I was surprised, but I’ve always been a Van Halen fan, and dug that they were playing it. Rev105 was the most eclectic radio station I’ve ever listened to, and while I was surprised to hear Van Halen, it wasn’t out of the norm from some of the things they played." />

<p>I vividly remember the day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGVX">Rev105</a> changed formats. My wife and I were leaving work and climbed into the car in the carpool lot. Turning on the car, Van Halen was playing. I was surprised, but I’ve always been a Van Halen fan, and dug that they were playing it. Rev105 was the most eclectic radio station I’ve ever listened to, and while I was surprised to hear Van Halen, it wasn’t out of the norm from some of the things they played. And then another hard rock song came on, and another – and they announced the new call letters, X105. And just like that, my favorite radio station was dead.</p>
<p>The latest Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees were announced a week and a half ago. To celebrate, 89.3 The Current played a number of the inductees, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hall and Oates</li>
<li>Linda Rondstadt</li>
<li>Cat Stevens</li>
<li>Peter Gabriel</li>
</ul>
<p>Mary Lucia was driving to work when they played the above artists and missed Barb Abney’s introduction to the set list. <a href="http://blog.thecurrent.org/2013/12/the-day-the-current-almost-gave-mary-lucia-a-heart-attack/">Her reaction was hilarious</a>, along with the voicemail she left to Jill Riley, co-host of the morning show on The Current:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I FREAKED out! Not another format change! This isn’t happening again! I was convinced we had flipped formats overnight and this was my way of finding out I no longer had a job at the Current.</p>
<p>I know this sounds overly dramatic, but friends, this has happened to me before in my radio career: One day I have a job, and the next day we are playing Scorpions and Nazareth. BOOM! “Thanks for all of your hard work, now who needs a box to pack up your [stuff]?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blog.thecurrent.org/2013/12/the-day-the-current-almost-gave-mary-lucia-a-heart-attack/">Hit the link to read her reaction</a>, listen to the voicemail and the Twitter reactions by people around the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>Kudos to The Current for sharing this – it brought a smile to my face.</p>
