      <description>Since I turned 40 earlier this year, it was time my mid-life crisis kicked in.
Ok, that’s not true – two years ago my wife and I each set some goals, with the reward of getting a tattoo. She set a running goal (I don’t remember how many miles she had to run over the course of the year) and my goal was to get under 200 pounds. In just over 2 years, I’ve lost 40 pounds, and that was mostly stopping and starting running and working out.</description>
