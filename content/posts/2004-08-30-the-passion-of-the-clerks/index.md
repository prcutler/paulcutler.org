Tomorrow, Clerks X is released on DVD. This 10th anniversary edition of Kevin Smith&#8217;s Clerks is the definitive version of the movie including the original cut of the film shown at the Sundance Film Festival, as well as the version released in theaters.

But wait, there&#8217;s more! Kevin Smith has been hinting that he would be doing a &#8220;small project&#8221; prior to Green Hornet. [And it&#8217;s a sequel to Clerks][1], tentatively titled &#8220;The Passion of the Clerks&#8221;. (Link to press release on Kevin Smith&#8217;s site, View Askew).
