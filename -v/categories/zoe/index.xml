      <description>I haven’t blogged in almost a year, so here’s a picture of Alex with Jack and Zoe. Alex graduated from boot camp in the United States Navy last week and is embarking on his new career as a nuclear engineer.</description>

      <title>I love Minnesota Music</title>

      <description>As a transplant to Minnesota from Wisconsin, I’ve now spent over half my life here. I’m a cheesehead through and through, but if there is one thing that Minnesota has that Wisconsin has never had, it’s the music. The first album I ever bought was Prince’s Purple Rain and my first ever trip to Minnesota I actually met Prince, which is another story for a different time. A few years later I was living here and I won tickets on Rev105 to a local music showcase at First Avenue.</description>

      <title>The story of the horsey</title>

      <description>Our Video Supervisor, Dave, made me this horse as a present, it was a hobby of his, when Alex was born.
Alex wasn’t a big rider, but Dave was one of the cooler guys I’ve worked with in all my time at retail. A bit older (especially older than me), he was one of the few that really made me feel welcome after we had moved cross country.
Zoe really likes to rock on the horse, as evident in the grin on her face.</description>

      <description>You can tell by the look on Zoe’s face she doesn’t know what to make of strangers.</description>

      <description>Beautiful weather yesterday, so we fired off some shots of Zoe dancing on the deck.
I’ve got them on my Flickr site.
You can see the whole Zoe set here.
I also finally put up a few of Alex from his school’s Fiesta Night in Feb.</description>
