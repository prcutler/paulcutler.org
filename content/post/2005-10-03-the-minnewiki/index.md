[Minnesota Public Radio][1] has launched the [Minnewiki][2], a Wiki page dedicated to the music scene past and present in Minnesota.

Users have the opportunity to add to the articles on the Minnewiki, discussing musical acts, venues and the various musical history of Minnesota.

As with any Wiki, some pages are more comprehensive, but it&#8217;s off to a nice start.
