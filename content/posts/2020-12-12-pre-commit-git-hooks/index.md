It was a pleasant surprise recently to get an email from Michael Kennedy
at [Talk Python/](https://talkpython.fm/). As a previous buyer of one of
the [Talk Python Everything Bundle](https://training.talkpython.fm/) which includes a number of different Python
training courses, I was eligible for the “Pro” [Talk Python podcast](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/all) subscription,
which doesn’t included ads.

Going through the backlog, I added a bunch of episodes, and the timing
of [Episode 282: Pre-Commit Framework](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/282/pre-commit-framework) was perfect. Just
as I’m getting back into working on my projects, now is a perfect time to set
up [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to help format my code. The documentation was easy to
follow as well as other walk throughs on the web, and now every time I check in code, it runs `black` to format it
Pythonically, `isort` to automatically sort my imports in each of my files, and I’ll be adding `flake8` this weekend,
too.

Thanks again for the Pro podcast subscription, Talk Python!
