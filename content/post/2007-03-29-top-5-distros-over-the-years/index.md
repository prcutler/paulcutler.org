[Tristan Rhodes blogs][1] (seen via Planet Ubuntu), about [Distrowatch][2]&#8216;s Top 5 Distro&#8217;s from 2002 until today. It is, as Tristan mentions, unscientific as Distrowatch ranks it by click through&#8217;s to that distro&#8217;s information page on Distrowatch. It&#8217;s interesting to see the changes through just 5 short years.

I eagerly look forward to the day Foresight is on the list.
