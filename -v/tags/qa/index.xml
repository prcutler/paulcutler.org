      <description>We are getting ready to release Foresight GNOME edition in the next week, once GNOME 2.24 is out.
Foresight is a rolling release distro – our packages are almost always up to date, and we keep them up to date, unlike most distributions that have 2 big releases a year, which is when they update packages.
Being a rolling release, this means that a Foresight “release” is just a snapshot in time of what is available in the repository.</description>
