The [trailer][1] for [V for Vendetta][2] has been released. Available in standard Quicktime, or 1920&#215;1280 HD in Quicktime 7 using the h.264 codec.

I had read the graphic novel over 10 years ago, and bought it and re-read it 3 weeks ago. I absolutely love the author, Alan Moore, and this particular story &#8211; though his books are 10x better than the movies that are turned out based on his source material, as he&#8217;s never been involved in any of the movies made from his books.

The imagery and themes seem very true to the comic book, though I&#8217;ve heard a few things about the movie that don&#8217;t ring true.

We&#8217;ll see &#8211; the Wachowski brothers adapted and produced it, and it stars Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman.
