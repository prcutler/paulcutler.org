![Silver Saucer](silversaucer.png)


Silver Saucer originally started as an idea for a business name ten years ago after I was laid off from what I thought was my dream job.  I quickly decided consulting wasn't for me, but I've kept the domain name all these years.  The logo is inspired from both *The X-Files* and a poem by Neil Gaiman, *The Day the Saucers Came*.

As of July 2020, the site is currently a work progress.  I am using Silver Saucer to continue to learn the Pyramid web framework, Bootstrap and CSS, and `pytest`.  Unlike NFLPool and MLBPool2, I am learning how to use Pyramid "the right way", which means without the `pyramid_handlers` package.  The design and CSS are complete and I am currently working on the Discogs API integration.
