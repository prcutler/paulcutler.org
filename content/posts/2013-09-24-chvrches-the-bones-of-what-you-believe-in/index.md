One of the albums I&#8217;ve been looking forward to the most this year is finally out today.  _The Bones of What You Believe In_ by the Glasgow band [Chvrches][1] has had singles released all summer long and the wait has been killing me.  I&#8217;m only half way through my first listen on [Rdio][2] and it&#8217;s everything I wanted and more.

UPS will be delivering my vinyl copy later today and I can&#8217;t wait to give it a spin.

Chvrches recently played First Avenue here in Minneapolis.  City Pages&#8217; Gimme Noise blog [did an interview][3] and [recapped the concert][4] (complete with a Prince cover!)- those who were there swear it will be the last time you&#8217;ll be able to see the band in such in intimate setting as they are going to break big.
