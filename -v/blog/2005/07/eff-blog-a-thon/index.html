<p>I can’t say it any better than they did:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to hear about your “click moment” — the very first step you to took to stand up for your digital rights — whether it was blogging about an issue you care about, participating in a demonstration, writing your representatives, or getting involved with EFF. As a thank you, we’ve enlisted an independent panel of judges to choose from among your posts for “Most Inspirational,” “Most Humorous,” and “Best Overall.” At the end of the Blog-a-thon, we’ll announce the names of the three bloggers with the best posts on our website and in our weekly newsletter, EFFector. We’ll also publish the three best posts on our site and send the authors a blogging “kit” as an extra thank you: an EFF bloggers’ rights T-shirt, special EFF-branded blogger pajama pants, a pound of coffee, and a pair of fuzzy slippers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve been thinking about my story for the last few days since I first came across this. It will definitely be up by Aug. 2nd.</p>
