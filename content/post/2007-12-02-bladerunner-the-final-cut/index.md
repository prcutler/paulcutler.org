I headed to downtown Minneapolis Friday afternoon, and caught a screening of [Bladerunner: The Final Cut][1].

It&#8217;s been 48 hours since I saw the film, and it touches me in a way few films do &#8211; I sit here and still struggle to put in to words the emotions Bladerunner evokes for me. From the themes of consumerism and humanism to the grim picture the film paints of the future, few science fiction films hold up as well as Bladerunner does after twenty-five years.

[SFGate.com has an excellent review][2] of Ridley Scott&#8217;s masterpiece as well.
