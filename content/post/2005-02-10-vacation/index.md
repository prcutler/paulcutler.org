Vacation is half over and I haven&#8217;t done a damn thing. And I like it.

Lots of playing [WoW][1], and I have worked on the server a bit (damn DHCP and firewall giving me errors).

I&#8217;ve also aggregated all of my music onto one machine, which will lead me to cleaning some hard drives and installing linux on one of my other PCs. That machine will have rsync automated to back up the master collection on the server so I won&#8217;t have to worry about another hard drive crash.

Back to more vacation.
