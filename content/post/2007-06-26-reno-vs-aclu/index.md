Today is the 10th anniversary of the landmark [Reno vs. ACLU][1] decision, which set the course for free speech on the internet.

From the [EFF][2]:

> Tuesday marks the ten year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Courts landmark [decision][3] in _Reno v. ACLU_, which recognized that free speech on the Internet merits the highest standards of Constitutional protection. EFF participated as both plaintiff and co-counsel in the case, which successfully challenged the online censorship provisions of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996. The Courts decision &#8212; its first involving the Internet &#8212; was issued on June 26, 1997.
> 
> The CDA fight was one of the first big rallying points for online freedom. When the law passed, thousands of websites [turned their backgrounds black][4] in protest. EFF launched its [&#8220;blue ribbon&#8221;][5] campaign and millions of websites around the world joined in support of free speech online. Even today, you can find the blue ribbon [throughout the Web.][6]

The Blue Ribbon campaign was the first introduction I had to the [EFF][2] &#8211; I remember the day the web turned black to fight the CDA, and I remember putting a Blue Ribbon on one of the first very basic websites I created.

Ten years later, I am still a believer and supporter of the EFF &#8211; wearing their swag, blogging their causes, and [supporting them financially][7] by having become a Pioneer level contributor for the last 5 years.

The EFF supports many different worthy causes, including: fighting for free speech, fair use (including fighting the broadcast flag), illegal spying, and anonymity.

Thanks to all the fine folks at the EFF for all their hard work.
