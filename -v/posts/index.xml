            <description>I haven’t blogged about my progress on Silver Saucer over the last month, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I haven&amp;rsquo;t been up to anything. I’ve continued to take the HTML, CSS, and Javascript on Coursera. I find CSS&amp;hellip; difficult. Unfortunately, I also received an email from the course instructor that Coursera will be removing this course soon, so that figures. But it&amp;rsquo;s motivation to get it done.
One of the things I tackled a few weeks ago was making an applet to sit in the macOS menu bar to control the volume of my Denon receiver located in my home theater.</description>

anything. I’ve continued to take the HTML, CSS, and Javascript on Coursera. I find CSS&hellip; difficult. Unfortunately, I
also received an email from the course instructor that Coursera will be removing this course soon, so that figures.
But it&rsquo;s motivation to get it done.</p>
<p>One of the things I tackled a few weeks ago was making an applet to sit in the macOS menu bar to control the volume of
my Denon receiver located in my home theater. The receiver’s Zone 2 controls the volume in my office, where I’m usually
listening to records. It took 30 minutes to throw some code together using <a href="https://github.com/jaredks/rumps">RUMPS</a>
to make the applet and the <a href="https://github.com/scarface-4711/denonavr">denonavr</a> Python module to control the receiver.</p>
<p>That led me down a path of looking into making a hardware project to make a dial to control the volume. Adafruit has
a <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/media-dial/overview">great tutorial on building one</a> using Circuit Python, but I don’t
have a 3D printer (yet).</p>
<p>That led me into looking more into the <code>denonavr</code> Python module - which is also the same module that
powers <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>. I’ve now reinstalled Home Assistant - it’s been a couple of
years since I last tried it out. Now I can just turn to a browser page I leave pinned and control my receiver from
there. I’ve spent a few days playing and tweaking Home Assistant to see most of my “smart” devices, but I’ve never been
all that into having a smart home (nor will you find any voice assistants here). Of course this has given me a dozen
ideas of things to build or integrate. But I think I still want to build a dial!</p>
<p><img src="ha-denon.png" alt="Denon Control in Home Assistant"></p>
<p>I also spent a few days doing a deep dive into Docker. I have a couple containers that I run on my NAS, but never really
understood the right way to update or manage them. Now that I have a little more knowledge I realize how slick
containers really are.</p>
<p>Finally, I was on vacation last week and started to tackle another project I’ve talked about with a friend for the last
couple years. We need a pump (or pumps) programmed for a project. I had some old Raspberry Pi computers laying around
and a year ago we quickly prototyped a solution. Unfortunately, we needed a more powerful pump - both in how it pumps
and in power consumption.</p>
<p>I’ve been learning about circuits and electricity by watching a lot of YouTube videos and reading a number of books I’ve
picked up over the years (especially on Humble Bundle) . I then went out and bought bench power supply unit (PSU) and
multimeter for my workbench. I figured out how to power the breadboard with a 3.3v / 5v breadboard power supply first
and then figured out how to use the PSU, too. It was kind of exciting to see a little blue LED light up the first time I
got a circuit right:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s a picture of my messy workbench below with the Pi hooked up to a breakout board which connects to the breadboard.
Also connected to the breadboard is a DRV8825 motor controller which is connected to a NEMA step-motor.</p>
<p>In theory, I have everything hooked up correctly now to start prototyping. Now the hard part starts:  Is the code wrong
or the hardware hooked up incorrectly?!</p>

            <description>I love this blog post from Discogs. I’ve often thought of doing exactly what it lays out: listen to your record collection from A to Z.
I know there are a lot of records I rarely listen to. Whether I bought them because I love the artist, because of their rarity, or just because I was taking a chance on something new, I’m sure there are records collecting dust.
I’ve done a pretty good job, especially last year in the first year of the pandemic, selling off any records I know I won’t listen to again on Discogs.</description>

<p>I love this <a href="https://blog.discogs.com/en/listen-to-your-record-collection-a-to-z/">blog post</a> from Discogs. I’ve often
thought of doing exactly what it lays out:  listen to your record collection from A to Z.</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of records I rarely listen to. Whether I bought them because I love the artist, because of their
rarity, or just because I was taking a chance on something new, I’m sure there are records collecting dust.</p>
<p>I’ve done a pretty good job, especially last year in the first year of the pandemic, selling off any records I know I
won’t listen to again on Discogs. I also take some pride in that if the record is rare or was released on Record Store
Day for example, not to overcharge when selling some of these.</p>
<p>I haven’t decided what I’m going to do about artists like Ryan Adams. I was a huge fan, but I haven’t listened to one
song of his since news broke a couple years ago of how he abused women.</p>
<p>First up today:  ABBA!  I’ve always loved them, probably due to hearing them so much as a kid from my step-mother.
The record on top of the photo is ABBA’s Waterloo, their second album. I actually picked this up at Electric Fetus a
couple years ago and until today, I’m embarrassed to say, it was still sealed - 48 years later!  But not anymore!</p>
<p>I’m lucky that my home theater is on the other side of the wall from my home office. My office is Zone 2 and it’s an
eight foot walk to put a record on. This way while I’m working during the week or writing or tinkering on projects on
the weekends I almost always have music on.</p>

            <title>Silver Saucer Update</title>

            <description>Now that I have the ability to pick a random record to play using the Discogs API, I’ve completed one of the two big features.
I’m now debating what to do next. I have a few options, all still focused on the random album feature. (I may have to cancel the “On This Day” future, but that’s a different discussion for a different time).
Learn CSS I need to learn CSS as the theme I’m using needs to be updated.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that I have the ability to pick a random record to play using the Discogs API, I’ve completed one of the two big
features.</p>
<p>I’m now debating what to do next. I have a few options, all still focused on the random album feature.  (I may have to
cancel the “On This Day” future, but that’s a different discussion for a different time).</p>
<h2 id="learn-css">Learn CSS</h2>
<p>I need to learn CSS as the theme I’m using needs to be updated. The text colors in the theme are too dark and I had to
use a hack to show the text in white. This also means that the link colors are also appearing as white and you can’t
tell that they are links. In the past I’ve been able to get away with just poking at a CSS file to get done what I want,
but I really should take the time to learn it. The CSS file for Silver Saucer is huge and there are parts of it when I
look at it that I have no idea what it does.</p>
<h2 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h2>
<p>I <em>think</em> I need to learn CSS before I tackle Bootstrap. Right now when the album results are returned, everything is
centered on the page. I played around with trying to justify it left and right and it doesn’t work at all visually. I
need to create a Bootstrap container to put the text in so I can justify it correctly.</p>
<h2 id="release-date">Release Date</h2>
<p>The <strong>Release Date</strong> returned is when that particular version of an album was released. If it’s a re-release or
repressing, that date can be very different from when the album was originally released. I think I can use the master
release number to go get a list of all releases and then look at the first release in that list to get the “real”
release date. It doesn’t always work in some random testing I did, but it’s a start. My idea to look at the Musicbrainz
API doesn’t look like it’s any better. The other challenge with this feature is working with <code>datetime</code> objects, which
can be frustrating. Especially considering Discogs might return the release date in multiple different formats,
including just the month, month and year, or date / month / year. That will be fun to standardize.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>I also need to fix the data returned in <strong>Genre</strong>. It’s a list that I currently show as a list of bullets, each on its
own line. It doesn’t look quite right and I need to probably update the CSS or when iterating over the list, put it on
one line. I haven’t quite figured out what to do with it yet.</p>
<p>I also, in theory, could deploy what I have now. But I think I&rsquo;ll wait just a bit.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>I’m leaning towards tackling CSS first. I&rsquo;ve started the Responsive Web Design class on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a>, and it&rsquo;s good content, but the way they have you practice I don&rsquo;t feel as if the information is
sticking in my head. I’ve also signed up for a free  (to audit) <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers">five week course on Coursera</a> to learn
HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Part of me really wants to learn just a little Javascript, but most of me doesn’t - I’d
rather focus on getting better at Python as I don’t feel like I’m anywhere close from transition from novice Python to
intermediate Python. But if I’m going to continue to focus on using Python for web development, which is where my
passion seems to lie at the moment, I need to get better at HTML and CSS. The structure of an actual class is helpful,
so I’ll probably move forward with the Coursera class for the time being.</p>

            <description>I was talking to my wife yesterday about my progress and she agreed that I should update my existing method used for albums to also work for singles - and that I shouldn’t just re-use that method and to avoid code duplication. It’s good to get confirmation that I’m on the right path.
But I’m stuck on how to do this.
If we look at the route to play a full album:</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was talking to my wife yesterday about my progress and she agreed that I should update my
existing method used for albums to also work for singles - and that I shouldn’t just re-use that method and to avoid
code duplication. It’s good to get confirmation that I’m on the right path.</p>
<p>But I’m stuck on how to do this.</p>
<p>If we look at the route to play a full album:</p>
<pre><code>@view_config(route_name=&quot;play&quot;, renderer=&quot;silversaucer:templates/play/play.pt&quot;)
def play(_):

    album_release_id = RandomRecordService.get_folder_count(2162484)
    release_data = RandomRecordService.get_album_data(album_release_id)
    return {&quot;release_info&quot;: release_data}

</code></pre><p>Here I’m manually passing the folder ID for my Discogs Folder that contains full albums (2162484). That ID is passed to
a method that gets a count of how many items are in that folder to pick one at random. Once that happens, it passes the
release ID of the pick to get the album’s information.</p>
<p>Works great for full albums. As mentioned in my last blog post, it bombs if it’s a single, because there’s no concept of
a main (or “master”) release associated with EPs and singles.</p>
<p>So how do I refactor my code to account for this?</p>
<p>I started by updating the route to play a full album, adding a <code>folder</code> parameter to the <code>get_folder_count</code> method
instead of passing the folder number manually:</p>
<pre><code>@view_config(route_name=&quot;play&quot;, renderer=&quot;silversaucer:templates/play/play.pt&quot;)
def play(_):

    folder = 2162484
    album_release_id = RandomRecordService.get_folder_count(folder)
    release_data = RandomRecordService.get_album_data(folder, album_release_id)
    return {&quot;release_info&quot;: release_data}
</code></pre><p>And I tell that method to now return both the release ID and the folder:</p>
<pre><code>def get_folder_count(folder):

    discogs_api = folder_url + &quot;?=&quot; + api_token

    # TODO Add an if statement to check for a 200 or 404 response code and redirect on 404 to error page

    response = requests.get(discogs_api)

    record_json = response.json()
	  return random_album_release_id, folder

</code></pre><p>Keeping with my goal of only using one method and passing the folder to it, I added an <code>if</code> statement to check if it’s
the folder with full albums. If it is, get the data I know is working. If not, don’t get the data that’s not included in
an EP or single.</p>
<pre><code>@staticmethod
def get_album_data(folder, album_release_id):

    if folder == 2162484:

        release_api = (
            config.discogs_url
            + &quot;releases/&quot;
            + str(album_release_id)
            + &quot;?&quot;
            + config.discogs_user_token
        )
        print(release_api)
        response = requests.get(release_api)
        print(response)

</code></pre><p>But now my method to get the release information on an album broke, when it was working before:</p>
<pre><code>  File &quot;/Users/prcutler/workspace/silversaucer/silversaucer/controllers/music_controller.py&quot;, line 14, in play
    release_data = RandomRecordService.get_album_data(folder, album_release_id)
  File &quot;/Users/prcutler/workspace/silversaucer/silversaucer/services/play_service.py&quot;, line 114, in get_album_data
    release_uri = release_json[&quot;uri&quot;]
KeyError: 'uri'
</code></pre><p>Digging into it with another print statement, I see that the value for <code>album_release_id</code> is now returning the folder ID
correctly, but `album_release_id is returning a tuple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Folder" data-lang="Folder"></code></pre><p>Which is why the API call below is screwed up:</p>
<pre><code> File &quot;/Users/prcutler/workspace/silversaucer/silversaucer/services/play_service.py&quot;, line 114, in get_album_data
    release_uri = release_json[&quot;uri&quot;]
KeyError: 'uri'
https://api.discogs.com/releases/(1366279, 2198941)?&amp;token=
</code></pre><p>But it’s a tuple!  I can work with that. The <code>folder</code> number is always returned as the second part of the tuple and
the <code>album_release_id</code> is always the first index. So let’s update the <code>release_api</code> first to use the first index:</p>
<pre><code>release_api = (
    config.discogs_url
    + &quot;releases/&quot;
    + str(album_release_id[0])
    + &quot;?&quot;
    + config.discogs_user_token
)
</code></pre><p>And now everything works!  I updated the <code>else</code> statement to go get the data I need and not include the values that were
returning a <code>KeyError</code> and now with one method - that includes an <code>if / else</code> statement, I can get back the release
information for any record in my collection, no matter what folder it’s in. If and when I add other media - especially
CDs or tapes that have a main release, I’ll need to update the <code>if</code> statement, but future me can deal with that. I don’t
even have that stuff cataloged yet.  (But I made sure to add a <code>TODO</code> to my code so I don’t forget.</p>
<p>And here’s a screenshot of a random 10” EP that was returned. Yay!</p>

            <description>Earlier this year when I finished cataloging all my records in Discogs, I then put each one into a “folder”, a way for Discogs to separate different kinds of records. It’s setup by the user, so I created a folder for each type of music I have, and the number is the ID that Discogs assigned to each one:
all_folder = 0 lp_folder = 2162484 twelve_inch_folder = 2198941 ten_inch_folder = 2162486 seven_inch_folder = 2162483 cd_folder = 2162488 tape_folder = 2162487 digital_folder = 2198943 CD, Digital and Tape don’t currently have any items in them, but I hope to at least catalog my CD collection some day, but that’s a different story.</description>

seven_inch_folder = 2162483

tape_folder = 2162487
digital_folder = 2198943
</code></pre><p>CD, Digital and Tape don’t currently have any items in them, but I hope to at least catalog my CD collection some day,
but that’s a different story.</p>
<p>In the music controller, the method to get an album’s information looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>@view_config(route_name=&quot;play&quot;, renderer=&quot;silversaucer:templates/play/play.pt&quot;)
def play(_):

    album_release_id = RandomRecordService.get_folder_count(2162484)
    release_data = RandomRecordService.get_album_data(album_release_id)
    return {&quot;release_info&quot;: release_data}

</code></pre><p>Here I’ve hard coded the folder ID (2162484) from Discogs in the method as I only want to use the folder that has only
full albums (no singles, 45s, etc.).</p>
<p>Now it’s time to wire up the code to play a single from one of three folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>7” or 45</li>
<li>10” EPs</li>
<li>12” singles / remixes</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks similar to the method above, but I’ve added a random method to pick one of the three folders for me and pass
the folder ID to the play service that I’ve already written for full albums:</p>
<pre><code>def play_single(_):

    random_folder = randint(0, 2)
    if random_folder == 0:
        single = 2162483
    elif random_folder == 1:
        single = 2162486
    else:
        single = 2198941

    album_release_id = RandomRecordService.get_folder_count(single)
    print(album_release_id)
    release_data = RandomRecordService.get_album_data(album_release_id)
    print(release_data)

    return {&quot;release_info&quot;: release_data}

</code></pre><p>This is where I appear to have outsmarted myself. I thought I had blogged about this, but apparently not. At one point I
had refactored the first play method above - I had added the play service to accept the folder ID and pass that. I was
pretty proud of myself because after the refactoring, I figured this would work for exactly what I’m trying to do now -
pass the folder ID of other folders. But no, it wasn’t meant to be as it errors out:</p>
<pre><code>  File &quot;/Users/prcutler/workspace/silversaucer/silversaucer/controllers/music_controller.py&quot;, line 35, in play_single
    release_data = RandomRecordService.get_album_data(album_release_id)
  File &quot;/Users/prcutler/workspace/silversaucer/silversaucer/services/play_service.py&quot;, line 178, in get_album_data
    discogs_main_id = release_json[&quot;master_id&quot;]
KeyError: 'master_id'
</code></pre><p>There is no <code>master_id</code> returned because singles don’t have a master release!  Only full albums have a master release to
track all the regional releases and special pressings.</p>
<p>I need to think through this and decide if I’m going to write a new method in <code>play_service</code> to handle getting back the
release information for the single or if I should write an <code>if</code> statement to account for the Key Error and return a
different dictionary without the <code>master_id</code>.</p>
<p>I was so proud of myself for doing something I thought was Pythonic, too!</p>

<pre><code>{'release_title': 'Massey Fucking Hall', 'release_uri': 'https://www.discogs.com/Japandroids-Massey-Fucking-Hall/release/16118824', 'artist_name': 'Japandroids', 'artist_url': 'https://api.discogs.com/artists/1473872', 'release_date': '2020-06-26', 'discogs_main_id': 1829048, 'discogs_main_url': 'https://api.discogs.com/masters/1829048', 'main_release_date': 2020, 'release_image_uri': 'https://img.discogs.com/BVmRNi_A5_Vm8X0ntzUDh8figvE=/fit-in/300x300/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(90)/discogs-images/R-16118824-1604177632-7503.jpeg.jpg', 'genres': ['Rock']}
</code></pre><p>In the controller that handles the routing for the page I have:</p>
<pre><code class="language-@view_config(route_name="play"," data-lang="@view_config(route_name="play",">def play(_):

    album_release_id = RandomRecordService.get_folder_count(2162484)
    print(album_release_id)
    release_data = RandomRecordService.get_album_data(album_release_id)
    print(release_data)

    return {&quot;release_info&quot;: release_data}
</code></pre><p>It was way easier than expected.  (And if you know me, you know that the random record picked above is perfect, as
I&rsquo;m a huge Japandroids fan.)  The first thing I did was connect the image URI that the Discogs API passes in the
Chameleon template:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img class=&quot;mb-5&quot; src=&quot;${release_info.release_image_uri}&quot; alt=&quot;${release_info.release_title}&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre><p>That worked, which was awesome.  The whole image is shown, and I don&rsquo;t have to worry about parsing any of the URL.</p>
<p>I quickly added the values to show the <em>Artist</em>, <em>Album</em>, and <em>Release Date</em> information:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Artist: ${release_info.artist_name}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Album: ${release_info.release_title}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released: ${release_info.release_date}&lt;/p&gt;\
</code></pre><p>It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="japandroids.png" alt="Japandroids - Massey Fucking Hall"></p>
<p>Looking at Debbie Gibson&rsquo;s <em>Electric Youth</em>, the <em>Genre</em> key in the dictionary returns a list:</p>
<pre><code>'genres': ['Electronic', 'Pop']
</code></pre><p>With some trial and error I was able to display the list, but it showed up as code, looking like:
<code>['Electronic', 'Pop']</code>.  No one wants to see that.  The challenge is that Chameleon templates use something like a
shorthand for Python code.  I revisited two of my former projects where I would iterate over a list and show the
results, but after lots of trial and error I felt like I was going backwards.  Some more search engine queries and
Stack Overflow searching I did what I always do when I get stuck:  I asked my wife.  It took her about 15 minutes to
figure out how to loop over the list and show it in bullets:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;li tal:repeat=&quot;item release_info.genres&quot; tal:content=item/&gt;
</code></pre><p>I was so close - she pointed out the mistake I made with having two <code>tal:repeat</code> methods in the template. That’s what’s
hard about the trial and error method of finding the solution, especially as I wasn’t writing down the methods
that kind of worked.  (Oops. Usually I have a note going in Bear to capture things like this, but sometimes you get in
the zone and just keep trying things as you get closer. Documentation is good!)</p>
<p>Lastly, I changed the image size of the album image returned from Discogs, shrinking it from 400x400 to 300x300 and
it seems to fit in the Bootstrap container better.  You can see the difference with Debbie Gibson&rsquo;s <em>Electric Youth</em>
below at 400x400 and Japandroids at 300x300 above.</p>
<p><img src="debbie-gibson.png" alt="Debbie Gibson - Electric Youth"></p>
<p>Now I have lots of cleanup to do.  I need to turn the text into links, for example if you click on the artist,
Japandroids, it takes you to their page on Discogs.  I also need to fix how it justifies and draws the bullets.  I think almost
all of this is done in CSS and I don&rsquo;t know CSS at all&hellip;  (I had to cheat to make the text color white to show up
on the page already.)</p>
<p>Random thoughts and musings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every time the page loads, it refreshes the API call.  So if you click a link to the artist page on Discogs, for
example, and then click the back button, that album data has been replaced.  Not sure how to work around that,
though I have some ideas.  Probably a good question in IRC with the Pyramid team.</li>
<li>I like Chameleon templates.  Not only is it the first template language I&rsquo;ve learned, I&rsquo;ve looked at Jinja
templates and they look harder to use.  They&rsquo;re used much more widely and that seems to lead to better documentation, but I
don&rsquo;t have plans to change from Chameleon.</li>
<li>I had more thoughts, but I&rsquo;m finishing up this blog post almost a week later as my internet went out.</li>
<li>The <em>Release Date</em> returned from Discogs has the same problem I&rsquo;ve already talked about for the future &ldquo;On This
Day&rdquo; feature I want to add.  It could be just the year or the full release date, you never know what you&rsquo;re going
to get.  Look at the two screenshots above! I don&rsquo;t know if I want to add all the functionality to return the
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; release date yet.  I&rsquo;m worried about how long the API calls take to load the page.  (Even if it&rsquo;s just for me and I know how long it
takes, I don&rsquo;t want it taking long.)</li>

            <description>After taking a break and coming back to it, I finally was able to iterate through the dictionary containing the folders I’ve sorted my records in to on Discogs.
Dictionaries are a basic object in Python, but my struggles show that to be good - at anything - takes practice. And I haven’t been practicing. Thank goodness for Stack Overflow!
I embedded all kinds of print statements trying to figure out how to play with the JSON from Discogs.</description>

I’ve sorted my records in to on Discogs.</p>
<p>Dictionaries are a basic object in Python, but my struggles show that to be good - at anything - takes practice. And I
haven’t been practicing. Thank goodness for Stack Overflow!</p>
<p>I embedded all kinds of <code>print</code> statements trying to figure out how to play with the JSON from Discogs.</p>
<p>After lots of trial and error, Google searches and Stack Overflow searches, I’ve got it.</p>
<p>After making the API call to Discogs, we get the JSON back:</p>
<pre><code>record_json = response.json()

json_data = record_json
json_folders = json_data[”folders”]
</code></pre><p><code>json_folders</code> is a list, so we add the last line above. Now I had to make a <code>for</code> loop to iterate through that list -
which is a list of dictionaries.</p>
<p>The <code>if</code> statement looks to see if <code>folder</code> - which we passed from the controller when the user clicked which kind of
album they want a random answer to, matches the folder ID found in the JSON.</p>
<pre><code>for get_folder_id in json_folders:
    print(json_folders)
    print(len(json_folders))

    if get_folder_id[”id”] == folder:

        lp_count = get_folder_id[”count”]
        print(”Folder passed = “, folder, ”LP Count is :”, lp_count)
        # folder_test = 2162484
        print(folder, lp_count)
</code></pre><p>Voila!  From there, I get a random number between one and the count found in the JSON. That number is then passed to the
pagination request to get the album ID.</p>
<p>Next up:  Either fix the pagination method to reduce the if / else statement or move on to getting the album release
information. I also need to remove a ton of print statements and clean up and remove all the methods I don’t have to use
after refactoring this. Progress!</p>

            <description>I’ve made some good progress over the last few days on being able to pick an album at random out of a given folder and get information about it.
All of the work has focused on the back-end. Once I know I’m getting the right data out of Discogs, I’ll hook up the front-end to display it, but for now, this has been a little more complex than I expected. (It always is, isn’t it?</description>

<p>All of the work has focused on the back-end. Once I know I’m getting the right data out of Discogs, I’ll hook up the
front-end to display it, but for now, this has been a little more complex than I expected.  (It always is, isn’t it?)</p>
<p>One thing that’s jumped out at me was I don’t understand how people do TDD (Test Driven Development). The amount of
trial and error I do, even on “simple” things like building the right URL for the API call is ridiculous. I know it’s
because I’m a novice at Python and I don’t do this for a living all day every day, but I have a lot of respect for those
that do TDD. One of my original goals was to do this in TDD, but I have my excuses.</p>
<p>You can tell I’m a novice by how procedural my code is. Do this, then do that. It was working well in a very procedural
manner, so yesterday I refactored it all. Yup, I ripped it up and started over. Well, not from scratch. I could
visualize in my head how to make the code more Pythonic and I was able to re-use some of the code, but most of it was
refactored in
the <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/silversaucer/blob/main/silversaucer/services/play_service.py">play_service</a>. A good
example is going back to the folder example. I had hard coded each folder ID and each folder had it’s own method to get
a random album release ID and its data.</p>
<p>I’ve been able to take the folder selected by the user (LP, EP or single) and just pass variable that to the method
in <code>play_service.py</code>. This allowed me to use the same method to get the release ID information and the method doesn’t
care if it’s a single or full album.</p>
<p>I still need to fix the loop I’m iterating through in the JSON, but I’m really close. This is one of the downsides to
being a hobbyist - so much I don’t remember, including basic things, like how to iterate through a dictionary.</p>
<p>Practice makes perfect and I needs lots of practice. I told myself I need to think of some more projects to work on, but
one project at a time. In the meantime, I should sign up for something
like <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/">Python Morsels</a> and keep up with it.</p>
<p>This weekend I’m hoping to fix looping over the list in the dictionary and also fix API call that deals with the pagination of results from Discogs.  You can see what a mess it is in the <code>play_service.py</code> file and I know there has to be a better way to programmatically determine the pagination than a long <code>if / else</code> statement.  (And if I ever get over a 1000 records it will break!  Or my wife will break me when I have that many…)</p>

            <description>I was ready this morning to write a new blog post chronicling all the problems I had yesterday trying to authenticate against the Discogs API. After finding the motivation to sit down and code for a few hours, I ended the day with almost nothing done. I could access the parts of my collection that were public, but the parts that required authentication I couldn’t figure out.
I sat down with my copy of coffee this morning, re-read the Discogs API authentication documentation, and voila!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was ready this morning to write a new blog post chronicling all the problems I had yesterday trying to authenticate
against the Discogs API. After finding the motivation to sit down and code for a few hours, I ended the day with almost
nothing done. I could access the parts of my collection that were public, but the parts that required authentication I
couldn’t figure out.</p>
<p>I sat down with my copy of coffee this morning, re-read
the <a href="https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:authentication">Discogs API authentication documentation</a>, and voila!  It
just clicked. Sometimes you just need a good night’s sleep.</p>
<p>You have two options for authentication when building an app with the Discogs API:  full Oauth that allows users to
login and validate their login, or pass a user token as part of the API query. Since my app is just going to use <em>my</em>
Discogs information, the user token is perfect. Both authentication options give you options for a higher rate limit and
the ability to return an image - and this last one will be important later.</p>
<p>I thought I would tackle what would be the easiest part first - have the app pick a random album for me to play.</p>
<p>It was a lot harder than I expected, but I’ve made good progress.</p>
<p>Now that I could get back details of my collection via authentication, I had Discogs return a list of all the folders
I’ve organized my music into. I put each of the following into its own folder, as when I hit the random button, I don’t
want it to pick a 45 or 7” record with only two songs on it. I have 10 folders, with 0 and 9 included by default:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 - all</li>
<li>1 - 10” (10” records, mostly EPs)</li>
<li>2 - 12” (12” singles or EPs)</li>
<li>3 - 7” (7” or 45 rpm singles)</li>
<li>4 - Autographed (currently empty, but you can have a release in more than one folder)</li>
<li>5 - Cassette</li>
<li>6 - CD</li>
<li>7 - Digital</li>
<li>8 - LP</li>
<li>9 - Uncategorized</li>
</ul>
<p>The JSON returned looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;folders&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;id&quot;: 0,

            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Digital&quot;,
            &quot;count&quot;: 1,
            &quot;resource_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.discogs.com/users/prcutler/collection/folders/2198943&quot;

        }
    ]
}
</code></pre><p>I then got stuck for a while before I realized I should be using the folder IDs in the <code>resource_url</code> and not the JSON
number of 0-9.</p>
<p>That - plus authentication - are challenges for someone like me still learning. But progress is being made. Lots of
trial and error with string concatenation to get the URLs and tokens right. The next thing to solve for:  Discogs only
returns 100 items in a list, making you interact with pagination to go deeper. I’ll need to do this to take the random
number generated of while album to play to get its data, including the image to show, when a random album is chosen.</p>

            <description>As a record collector, Discogs is invaluable. What started as a crowd sourced website to catalog electronic music, it now has a catalog of almost every piece of recorded music. They’ve also added robust e-commerce abilities so it makes buying and selling easy - whether it’s for something popular or a rare record only made in Greece.
It can take a little work to figure out which record you have, especially if it’s something popular like Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours, which has literally hundreds of different releases, some of which come down to figuring out the engraving on the inside of the record to figure out which pressing plant made it.</description>

<p>It can take a little work to figure out which record you have, especially if it’s something popular like Fleetwood Mac’s
Rumours, which has literally hundreds of different releases, some of which come down to figuring out the engraving on
the inside of the record to figure out which pressing plant made it.</p>
<p>The other thing that makes Discogs great is they have
a <a href="https://www.discogs.com/developers/#">Developer API</a> available, making it easy to interact
with all of the data they have stored programmatically. All of the data is available in JSON and there is also a Python
library available, making it even easier.</p>
<p>The amount of data about each album and each of its variants is amazing. I won’t go through all of it and you can get
an <a href="https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:database,header:database-master-release">overview here</a>
, but it includes almost everything you could probably think of off the top of your head.</p>
<p>Each album release has a “master” release, that represent a set of similar releases. If an album is released this
Friday, for example, and comes out on CD, cassette and vinyl, the master release would catalog each of these
individually. Each individual one is a “release”.  (And here’s to hoping Discogs changes the word master sometime in the
near future).</p>
<p>Here is the master release page for Pearl Jam’s Ten, released in 1991:</p>
<p><img src="pearl-jam-ten-master.png" alt="Pearl Jam Ten Master Release"></p>
<p>You can also see there are 251 different versions (or releases) of Ten on different formats. The list is currently
sorted by chronological year of release and if we scroll all the way down to 2009, we can find the repress I own on
vinyl. You can click through each individual release to see how it’s unique or find that particular version for sale.
Clicking through we see:</p>
<p><img src="pearl-jam-release.png" alt="Pearl Jam Vinyl Repress Release"></p>
<p>There is one thing I am looking for to build one part of my app:  What date was an album released? Neither the master
release or the release of the album I own supplies anything but the year, not the full date, which is what I want to
know to celebrate an album’s anniversary.</p>
<p>That’s by design. If you check
out <a href="https://support.discogs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005055093-Database-Guidelines-8-Release-Date">Discogs' Submission Guidelines</a>
, only the year is required. If you know the actual date, great, if you know the year and month, you can also input
that.</p>
<p>I also found a forum post from a few years ago, which I can’t find now, where the Discogs developers stated they
wouldn’t change the release date field to require a full year / month / day and they didn’t want to change the database
schema to support that (which I don’t blame them).</p>
<p>But that doesn’t help me in building a web app that shows which albums were released today in history.</p>
<p>In addition to my pandemic induced loss of motivation, this has blocked me from moving forward. I have a couple of
potential ideas to move forward.</p>
<p>The first is interfacing with
the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API">MusicBrainz API</a> in addition to Discogs.
MusicBrainz is a full open and free music database licensed under Creative Commons. They even link back to Discogs to
make it easy to link releases. My thought is if Discogs returns a date field that doesn’t include the month and day, to
then query MusicBrainz to see if they have it. I’m a little worried about responsiveness in making two queries like
that, plus dealing with two different JSON schemas and matching.</p>
<p>The second idea may work for the majority of releases, but there is a catch at the end. Doing a random check of albums,
when you look at a master release, the very first release chronologically almost always has the full date attached. I
could query the API, and slice the list returned and use the date provided in the first entry in the list. But I checked
one random album I had that I knew is an obscure
release (<a href="https://www.discogs.com/Maggies-Dream-Maggies-Dream/release/1035734">Maggie’s Dream</a> if you’re curious) and
there is no date.</p>
<p>So I think what I’m going to do - as I need to get going and <em>do</em> something - is to build out and test the second
option. This keeps me with just one API to learn in the short term and I can probably build a query pretty easily that
will sort all of my releases by chronological order (using the trick above) that will show me how many albums don’t have
a full release date. 10%? More? Less? Might as well build it out and get something done!</p>

            <description>The COVID-19 pandemic has changed a lot of things for a lot of people. One of the things it’s done to me is made it harder to focus on my coding projects. (Part of that is I’m very deadline driven, and well, no deadlines on personal projects…)
Looking back on this year, I’ve actually accomplished a lot, but just not on the coding side. I’m just getting back to it and I have two projects I’m going to make progress on.</description>

<p>Looking back on this year, I’ve actually accomplished a lot, but just not on the coding side. I’m just getting back to
it and I have two projects I’m going to make progress on. The first one is my music centric web app built with Pyramid
that interacts with my Discogs profile via the Discogs API. The second project involves a Raspberry Pi, but I’m much
better at the coding side of that than I am on the hardware side. (And that’s saying something with my novice coding
skills).</p>

            <description>I’ve started my next Python project: Silver Saucer, which will be hosted at silversaucer.com. I originally bought the domain about ten years ago when I was thinking of going into business for myself, which never happened and I hung onto the domain name because I liked it. It was inspired by Neil Gaiman’s poem, The Day The Saucers Came, which I also have a framed art print of:
 The Day the Saucers Came   Once upon a time, I was also a big fan of The X-Files, so it seems fitting.</description>

I originally bought the domain about ten years ago when I was thinking of going into business for myself, which never happened and I hung onto the domain name because I liked it.  It was inspired by Neil Gaiman’s poem, <em>The Day The Saucers Came</em>, which I also have a framed art print of:</p>

    <img src="day-the-saucers-came.jpg"/> </a><figcaption>
            <h4>The Day the Saucers Came</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once upon a time, I was also a big fan of <em>The X-Files</em>, so it seems fitting.</p>
<p>With the pandemic here, I’ve had a little time to work on some long dormant projects, this being one of them.  I’m stuck on another Python project (more because of the hardware than the coding), so I thought I’d find some time to work on this.</p>
<p>I have a few different goals of things I want to learn and practice:</p>
<h2 id="pyramid">Pyramid</h2>
<p>It’s my third project using the <a href="https://www.trypyramid.com">Pyramid web framework</a>.  I don’t have an urge to learn Flask or another framework - I would like to get better at Pyramid, which I know a little.  I also really like the Pyramid community.  The few times I’ve become stuck and asked for help in the Pyramid IRC channel, they’ve been both welcoming and helpful.  My first two Pyramid projects were based on the first training Talk Python offered for Pyramid, which used a package called <code>pyramid_handlers</code> which is no longer the recommend way to build a web app in Pyramid.  I’m doing it the recommended way this time, using a class based approach.</p>
<h2 id="bootstrap-and-css">Bootstrap and CSS</h2>
<p>I know a little of HTML, enough to get by.  But CSS and Bootstrap, not so much.  I’ve already integrated a Bootstrap theme and tweaked it where it’s almost working, but I’m just hacking at it - I don’t really know what I’m doing and it’s something I want to get better at.  I should probably find some good HTML / CSS tutorials and go through those.</p>
<h2 id="discogs-api-integration">Discogs API Integration</h2>
<p>The goal for Silversaucer.com is to integrate with the <a href="https://www.discogs.com/developers/">Discogs API</a>).  Discogs.com is a website that lets you catalog your record collection and also includes community features and a marketplace where you can buy and sell records (or CDs or almost any kind of media).  There are two things I want to build using the Discogs API:</p>
<h3 id="play-a-random-record">Play a random record</h3>
<p>I know that Discogs already has a feature on their website where you can have it randomly choose an item in your collection and if you shake the mobile app it will also show you a random item in your collection.  I want to take that to the next level and sort by type (record, 45, CD, etc.).</p>
<h3 id="on-this-day">On this day</h3>
<p>The second things I want to build is a page that shows all records released for today’s date.  This one is going to be more complicated and I’ll share more in a separate blog post.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>I’ve blogged about it before, but I struggle to learn <code>pytest</code>.  I’m going to continue to try and learn more about software testing, starting with this app.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>
<p>I’ve already hooked up Silver Saucer to Azure Pipelines to automatically do continuous integration.  I want to integrate <code>pytest</code> and code coverage next.  After that I may look into continuous delivery, but there’s is a lot about Azure that I don’t know.</p>
<p>Plenty of things to learn and keep me busy during these interesting times.  Here&rsquo;s a teaser for making it to the end:</p>

            <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using free and open source software (FOSS) for over twenty years and I&amp;rsquo;ve involved in with different FOSS projects for ten to fifteen years (on and off). Thare are so many different aspects of the open source community that I love (community being a big one to start with) and here&amp;rsquo;s another example.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to build a new website using Python and the Pyramid framework. I want to interact with APIs on the Discogs website.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to build a new website using Python and the <a href="https://www.trypyramid.com">Pyramid</a> framework.  I want to interact with APIs on the Discogs website.  <a href="https://www.discogs.com">Discogs</a> is a website and community that allows you to catalog your music and also buy and sell music.  For me, this is all about my record collection.  I&rsquo;ll be posting more about what I want to do, but right now I&rsquo;m just trying to learn what my options are with the <a href="https://www.discogs.com/developers/#">Discogs API and how to connect and interact with their API</a>.  I&rsquo;m struggling a little bit to get authentication working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also using <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>, an application that makes it easy to test different APIs and see how they return data.  I first learned about Postman through the <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm">Talk Python trainings</a> (another reason to love the Talk Python trainings) and it was a core tool in building NFLPool and MLBPool to understand how MySportsFeeds showed sports data to integrate into those two apps.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m struggling to authenticate and login to the Discogs API, I&rsquo;m never going to get any results.</p>
<p>And here is why I love open source:   Github user <a href="https://github.com/leopuleo">leopuleo</a> has a <a href="https://github.com/leopuleo/Discogs-Postman"><code>Discogs-Postman</code></a> repository where he has taken the time to not only put together almost 60 different ways to use the Discogs API, it also includes documentation and tests!</p>
<p><img src="postman.png" alt="Postman Discogs"></p>
<p><img src="postman-tests.png" alt="Postman Discogs Tests"></p>
<p>This is all licensed under the MIT License, giving you the ability to take it and modify as you need to.  <em>leopuleo</em> didn&rsquo;t have to do this, nor did he have to share it, or give it a license that just gives it away and let&rsquo;s you do anything you want with it.  This is just one reason why open source is awesome - someone builds something, shares it with the world, and even better, let&rsquo;s you build on top of it.</p>
<p>Open source and free software rock.</p>

            <description>I hooked up the Raspberry Pi to test it out. I did an update and it broke the boot up process and now wants the username and password. Think I remember that? Nope! Of course I don’t remember the password. So I downloaded a new RetroPie image which has led me down a rabbit hole of MAME configuration. The buttons on the controller don’t seem to be mapped correctly.
I did downloaded a new romset from the Internet Archive for MAME 0.</description>

So I downloaded a new <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie</a> image which has led me down a rabbit hole of MAME configuration.  The buttons on the controller don’t seem to be mapped correctly.</p>
<p>I did downloaded a new <a href="https://archive.org/details/MAME_0.209_ROMs_merged">romset from the Internet Archive for MAME 0.209</a>.  Doing further research, I tried both the mame4all emulator and libretro.  Both had unexpected results.  This led me into further research and it looks like I want to use a MAME 0.78 romset and the mame2003 emulator.  (This is due to RetroPie using the libretro emulation engine as it&rsquo;s primary emulator).  So I downloaded another 50GB from the Internet Archive and I’ll try out those ROMs to see if the buttons map correctly on the knockoff PS3 controller I’m using for testing.  It’s interesting that the joystick buttons are different based on what emulator I’m using.</p>
<p>I did briefly consider not using the Raspberry Pi 3B+ for the arcade cabinet and switching to a PC.  Reading some forums and Reddit posts, a PC is always recommended for MAME.  All I really want to do is play classic 80s arcade games that should mostly work with the Raspberry Pi.  A PC is mostly tempting to add the Dolphin emulator so I can play Super Mario Strikers for the Nintendo Gamecube, but I don’t know if that’s worth the expense or the trouble.  The Pi should more than handle the classic arcade games, Sega Genesis and Nintendo games I want to play.</p>
<p>But doing all the research is fun!</p>

            <description>A few days ago I asked Kelly for help in drawing the arcade on the plywood. I had tried to draw the lines for the top of the cabinet, but I just couldn’t visualize it. (It’s both an ongoing joke and the truth that her spacial relationships are a hundred times better than mine. You don’t want to see me try to even pack a suitcase, I’m terrible). I also needed help with how to draw the curves along the sides.</description>

<p><img src="practice-cut.jpg" alt="Practice Cuts"></p>
<p>We have two old pieces of plywood that we’ve used for desks at LAN / gaming parties over the last twenty years, with the last time a few years ago here at the new house.  This is what I used for my first practice round with the saws.</p>
<p>The cuts with the circular saw went pretty well.  They were fairly straight.  It was the jigsaw that was harder than expected.  I underestimated the strength needed to move the jigsaw.  I made three mistakes:  one of the big curves isn’t as smooth as it should be, though it could be sanded down;  the marquee cut didn’t follow the line correctly, though you can’t really tell; and I over cut a point where the jigsaw and circular saw cuts meet.</p>
<p>Overall, it was good for a first time.  I’m going to make one more practice run and then on to the real thing.  It’s going to snow the next few days, but this weekend looks nice&hellip;</p>

            <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent this week watching some videos and preparing for today when I&amp;rsquo;m going to make a practice cut for the first time using the circular saw and jigsaw. The hardest part is figuring out the curve of the cut for the side panel. The Geek Pub FAQ says this is explained in the video for the mini bartop. I just watched that video - and it&amp;rsquo;s not explained at all!</description>

I just watched that video - and it&rsquo;s not explained at all!  Even worse, the 10 seconds where it is explained is not applicable to the full size cabinet at all, in my opinion.  I showed Kelly and she said she&rsquo;ll help me, but I&rsquo;ll have to wait until her midterms are over this week.  That&rsquo;s fair and I&rsquo;ll keep watching videos to learn some best practices.  (Seriously, what did we ever do before YouTube?!)</p>

            <description>Kelly and I talked about the arcade today. She told me something I had already thought to myself - that this probably won’t be the last arcade I build. I&amp;rsquo;m going to make mistakes and want to do it again. This came up in the context of doing the router work for the t-molding. She recommended I don’t do the t-molding on the first build as I’m going to make mistakes and will probably want to do it again.</description>

<p>She’s right.  I’ve seen similar comments from people who have built their own arcade cabinets on Reddit.  I have zero - <strong>ZERO</strong> - woodworking skills, so it will probably be an ugly mess to start.  But I&rsquo;m torn.  I know that I can&rsquo;t let perfect be the enemy of good and if it is for practice, I should practice everything, including using a router.  So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I’m going to practice with some cuts this weekend and hopefully cut the sides next week when the weather gets warmer.</p>

            <description>I sold a bunch of my old Sonos equipment and decided to splurge on the arcade. I had been looking at GameOnGrafix for artwork for the side panels and the marquee for the arcade cabinet. I was undecided what I wanted to do as Kelly has a vinyl cutter, so it might be possible to make my own side panel art, but I was going to need a marquee.
And then I found the Pixelcade, which is an LED marquee.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I sold a bunch of my old Sonos equipment and decided to splurge on the arcade. I had been looking
at <a href="https://www.gameongrafix.com/">GameOnGrafix</a> for artwork for the side panels and the marquee for the arcade cabinet.
I was undecided what I wanted to do as Kelly has a vinyl cutter, so it might be possible to make my own side panel art,
but I was going to need a marquee.</p>
<p>And then I found the <a href="https://pixelcade.org/">Pixelcade</a>, which is an LED marquee. Available in five different sizes, I
went with the P4, a 20&quot; x 5&quot; marquee made of 2 LED panels. It should work out of the box with LEDBlinky (on Windows) and
RetroPie on the Raspberry Pi.  (I&rsquo;m still undecided what OS I&rsquo;m going to run if I don&rsquo;t use the Raspberry Pi 3 B+.)</p>
<p>Depending on the game you&rsquo;re playing, the marquee will display the game art / title for that game. From their website,
here&rsquo;s a cabinet when playing Pac-Man:</p>
<p><img src="pacman.jpeg" alt="Pac-Man"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s just a small sample of the game art Pixelcade supports from their homepage:</p>
<p><img src="pixelcade-art.jpg" alt="Pixelcade Art"></p>
<p>Check out their homepage for videos of it in action and more artwork.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to add some complexity to mount this in the cabinet as I have zero woodworking skills, but they have some
nice mounting guides that should hopefully get me started.</p>
<p>The Pixelcade consists of the two LED panels, a power supply, and a logic board with a micro-SD card. It looks like
there is really <a href="https://pixelcade.org/howto/">good documentation</a> for installation of the hardware and software,
including videos. And if I get really ambitious, there&rsquo;s even a <a href="https://pixelcade.org/api/">REST API</a> for more
customization.</p>
<p>I still have a ton of work before I even get to the point of installing this, but if and when this cabinet is done, the
Pixelcade is going to be a killer feature.</p>

            <description>Kelly needed to replace the blade in the saw and she cut me a new piece of wood to use as a prototype for the control panel. (At some point, I&amp;rsquo;m going to need to learn to use the saws!) After carefully paying attention to using the right size drill bit, my board looks like this:
Kelly then took a turn at doing it herself, and hers ended up the same way, so I don&amp;rsquo;t feel too bad.</description>

<p>Kelly then took a turn at doing it herself, and hers ended up the same way, so I don&rsquo;t feel too bad.  It&rsquo;s the quality of the wood, it&rsquo;s just too cheap.  The worst part is that the very first prototype that I built upside down was oak.  I couldn&rsquo;t ask for better wood and I screwed that up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to move on from a prototype and start focusing on building the cabinet out after a little more research and watching some more YouTube videos. (And hopefully it gets warmer soon so I can work outside!)</p>

            <description>If I don&amp;rsquo;t improve my attention to detail, I&amp;rsquo;m going to waste a lot of time and money. Case in point: just trying to build a prototype for the control panel so I can figure out how to use the Ipac controller and arcade buttons.
The first prototype I built 18 months ago I built upside down. I tried to fix it, but it was just uncomfortable to use.
The second control panel I drilled the holes the wrong size.</description>

<p>The second control panel I drilled the holes the wrong size.  I thought the normal size for an arcade button was a 1&quot; hole - it is not, it is a 1 1/8&quot; hole.  So that board got tossed.  Thankfully this is all old wood we had lying around that&rsquo;s fair game for stuff like this.</p>
<p>The third time was not the charm.  Even though I took the arcade buttons with me to the garage where I was drillign the holes, after I cut the first couple and inserted the buttons to double check - and I got it right up until that point - I then went on to drill a number of holes too small <strong>again</strong>.  I need to slow down and pay attention.</p>
<p>And for the record, I need 1&quot; holes for the 1P / 2P smaller buttons and 1 1/8&quot; holes for the normal arcade buttons.</p>

            <description>After a year and a half break from working on the arcade cabinet, it&amp;rsquo;s time to start again. I&amp;rsquo;ve started keeping a journal of my progress and I figured I might as well blog about it as well. I&amp;rsquo;ll use this to keep track of my progress, what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, and post some photos, too.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never done any woodworking - or really used power tools before - so I have a lot to learn.</description>

I&rsquo;ve started keeping a journal of my progress and I figured I might as well blog about it as well.  I&rsquo;ll use this to keep track of my progress, what I&rsquo;ve learned, and post some photos, too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done any woodworking - or really used power tools before - so I have a lot to learn.</p>
<p>Some random things I&rsquo;ve done today:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Circular saw - added videos to a new &ldquo;Woodworking&rdquo; Youtube playlist I created</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subscribed to <a href="https://www.thegeekpub.com/">The Geek Pub</a> - for $15 / year, I get access to all the plans they sell commercially as well as some additional videos.  Plans also include the SketchUp files, an online CAD-like program.</p>
<ul>
<li>4 different arcade plans for sale (or included in their subscription)</li>
<li>I liked the 2 player standup - it seems easier that <a href="http://koenigs.dk/mame/eng/index.htm">Koenigs</a> in trying to change the size</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reviewed plans again from <a href="http://koenigs.dk/mame/eng/index.htm">Koenigs</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Metric only - conversion to Imperial doesn’t seem exact enough</li>
<li>Going to be difficult to build in Imperial</li>
<li>These were the plans I wanted to use for the longest time, but going to go with The Geek Pub</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watched 2 circular saw videos</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The end of January may not be the best time for woodworking in the garage in Minnesota&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxwqGQIEFqo">Mavericks Arcade</a> videos on Youtube - <a href="https://www.ledblinky.net/ledblinky.htm">LEDBlinky</a> (which is Windows only) has been updated.  LEDBlinky looks really cool to control the LED lights in the buttons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally swapped the control panel prototypes</p>
<ul>
<li>I drilled the holes in the new panel one size too small</li>
<li>Not sure if I have right 1 1/4” drill bit?</li>
<li>Kelly cut a new piece of wood for me</li>
<li>Will the third time be the charm in making the control panel prototype?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s good to know I’m not crazy and I did set it up right and this answers the question of why my builds would work on Python 3.6 but not Python 3.7.  Kudos to Microsoft for the <a href="https://status.dev.azure.com/_event/130756107/post-mortem">detailed post-mortem</a> outlining the problem, what they did to fix it, and what they’ll do in the future to avoid something like this happening again.</p>
<p>In other news, I was distracted for a week to help a co-worker out with my first hardware project.  I wrote a few lines of code to turn on and off a small pump that is controlled by a Raspberry Pi.  I even wrote a test for it!</p>
<p>Lastly, I <em>almost</em> have <a href="https://codecov.io/">CodeCov.io</a> integrated into my CI.  I make a commit, Azure Pipelines builds it and runs the tests, and the coverage report generated from the build is uploaded to CodeCov.io.</p>
<p>Next I’ll finally start going through some of Talk Python training courses and use a TDD approach to write tests for what I’m learning.</p>

<h2 id="using-dependabot-to-manage-python-dependencies">Using Dependabot to manage Python dependencies</h2>
<p>All I want is to start coding.  I want to learn how to write a Pyramid app the correct way and also to start learning <code>pytest</code>.  There&rsquo;s just one more thing to do and one to tweak in Azure and then it&rsquo;s time for the fun part - the actual learning and coding.</p>
<p>First, I’m going to setup <a href="https://dependabot.com/">Dependabot</a> to help manage my Python dependencies.</p>
<p>Last year I bought a Python bundle on <a href="https://humblebundle.com">Humble Bundle</a> that included a one year subscription to <a href="https://pyup.io">Pyup.io</a>.  I’ve been using it for both NFLPool and MLBPool2 as it’s free for open source projects (both of those projects are licensed under a MIT license).  I haven’t decided what license the content on SilverSaucer.com, but knowing me, it will probably be open source.  But on the off chance it’s not, I’m going to try out <a href="https://dependabot.com/">Dependabot</a>.</p>
<p>Github recently purchased Dependabot and made it free.  Visit <a href="https://dependabot.com/">Dependabot</a>, sign in with your Github profile and link which repositories you want Dependabot to help manage.</p>
<p>That’s it - Dependabot will keep an eye on your <code>requirements.txt</code> and send you Pull Requests when it finds a new version of a Python module for you to merge.</p>
<p>As I’ve integrated with Azure Pipelines for continuous integration, it builds the pull request and tells me if it failed or succeeded, which is nice to know before I merge it:</p>
<p><img src="/images/20190624/dependabot-merge-details.png" alt="Dependabot Details"></p>
<p>But of the five pull requests Dependabot created, three of the five failed to build in Azure Pipelines:</p>
<p><img src="/images/20190624/dependabot-ci-failed.png" alt="Dependabot failed builds"></p>
<p>And it’s the <em>exact</em> same error as I ran into in part 2 - the builds in Python 3.6 work and they don’t in 3.7 due to some kind of (and I’m guessing) SQLAlchemy / pysqlite3 problem.  (Log)</p>
<p>After even more troubleshooting, and if I had any hair (which I don’t, thankfully) I would have pulled it out.  I finally gave up and just merged them all.  It built locally and I figured future me could deal with it.  And then all the builds worked again.  I have no idea why.  I don’t know how real developers do this stuff.  But it’s working now, even with a couple smaller commits to update the README.</p>
<p>But when it does work, it feels great.  I had updated the README, which kicked off a build, and since I hooked up Slack to Azure Pipelines, I saw this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/20190624/azure-build-worked.png" alt="Azure working build"></p>
<p>So now it’s setup just like the Test-Driven Development with Python says it should be.  From Chapter 24:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As our site grows, it takes longer and longer to run all of our functional tests. If this continues, the danger is that we’re going to stop bothering.
Rather than let that happen, we can automate the running of functional tests by setting up a “Continuous Integration” or CI server. That way, in day-to-day development, we can just run the FT that we’re working on at that time, and rely on the CI server to run all the tests automatically and let us know if we’ve broken anything accidentally. The unit tests should stay fast enough that we can keep running them every few seconds.”</p>
<p>Excerpt From: Harry Percival. “Test-Driven Development with Python.” Apple Books.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="additional-tasks-in-azure-pipelines">Additional Tasks in Azure Pipelines</h2>
<p>The Azure Pipeline docs are pretty great, including different things to configure based on the programming language you’re using.</p>
<p>For Python projects in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/python?view=azure-devops">Azure Pipelines</a>, there are two tasks to add:</p>
<ol>
<li>Publish Test Results</li>
<li>Publish Code Coverage</li>
</ol>
<p>I have a feeling these will come in handy later.</p>
<p>I’ve only played around with the HTML report code coverage generates a couple of times.  Looking at Azure DevOps, it looks kind of cool how they integrate testing into your dashboard.</p>
<p>In your project’s dashboard on Azure DevOps, go to <em>Test Plans</em> -&gt; <em>Runs</em>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/20190624/azure-test-runs.png" alt="Azure Test Plans / Runs"></p>
<p>Choose which test results you want to look at it and there are pretty reports for you to view, and if you keep scrolling down on the right hand side it will give you different outcomes for review.  It might save me a few clicks from the manual HTML code coverage builds, so I have that going for me.</p>
<p><img src="/images/20190624/pytest-results.png" alt="Pytest Results"></p>
<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
<p>Now it’s finally time to start coding.  I have two goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a web app with the <a href="https://trypyramid.com">Pyramid</a> web framework the correct way.   My first two projects used a module called <code>pyramid_handlers</code> to manage views.  This is an outdated way of writing code with Pyramid and I need to learn the modern way.</li>
<li>Use Test Driven Development methodology to <em>finally</em> learn how to write tests using <code>pytest</code>.  I’m going to write the test and then the code.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not quite sure how I’m going to do this yet.  I think it’s going to be a lot of jumping around a couple different <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm">Talk Python training courses</a>.  (If you have a rudimentary knowledge of Python, I highly recommend Talk Python’s training courses).</p>
<p>The course <a href="%5Bhttps://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/building-data-driven-web-applications-in-python-with-pyramid-sqlalchemy-and-bootstrap%5D">Building data-driven web apps with Pyramid and SQLAlchemy</a> contains the knowledge on Pyramid and also includes a chapter on testing.  The recently launched <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/100-days-of-web-in-python">#100DaysOfWeb in Python</a> has a bunch of chapters that will be useful in my quest, including Pyramid, Selenium, and Unit Testing Web Apps.  That doesn’t even include things I want to eventually learn, like a Javascript introduction, CSS and more.  (Yes, I saw the recent Jetbrains survey results and 40%+ of Python developers are using Flask for web development- but I’d like to get <em>good</em> at Pyramid before I switch to a different framework.  And I really, really like the Pyramid community.  The same could be said about my Python knowledge before diving into Javascript).</p>
<p>So while I’m going to kind of Frankenstein my courses, I’m going to do it using TDD.  I’m not going to build a PyPI clone like <a href="%5Bhttps://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/building-data-driven-web-applications-in-python-with-pyramid-sqlalchemy-and-bootstrap%5D">Building data-driven web apps with Pyramid and SQLAlchemy</a> teaches.  Silversaucer.com is just an online playground for me to keep learning, and the first thing I’m going to build is a Randomizer for my vinyl record collection using the Discogs API.  I’m going to work through the two courses above and I’ll also be using the following books to learn more about testing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/">Test-Driven Development with Python</a> by Harry Percival</li>
<li><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/pytest-quick-start-guide">pytest Quick Start Guide: Write better Python code with simple and maintainable tests</a> by Bruno Oliveira</li>
<li><a href="https://pragprog.com/book/bopytest/python-testing-with-pytest">Python Testing with pytest</a> by Brian Okken</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll keep blogging what I learn and where I get stuck.   I <em>need</em> to learn testing, especially if I want to continue maintaining and improving <a href="https://nflpool.xyz">NFLPool</a> and <a href="https://mlbpool2.com">MLBPool2</a>.  And learning how to code is fun, in a frustrating kind of way (at times).</p>

            <description>In Part 1, I covered the challenges I had in setting up my SSH key with Azure Pipelines to work with my existing Github repository, which contains a new Pyramid project without any customization (yet).
Now that Azure Pipelines could build my project, I spent the last week after that trying to figure out why builds would fail on Azure with Python 3.7, not with Python 3.6 or on my local development machine.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://paulcutler.org/blog/learning-pytest-using-continuous-integration-with-azure-pipelines-or-ssh-key-hell-part-1/">In Part 1, I covered the challenges I had in setting up my SSH key with Azure Pipelines</a>

<p>Now that Azure Pipelines could build my project, I spent the last week after that trying to figure out why builds
would fail on Azure with Python 3.7, not with Python 3.6 or on my local development machine.</p>
<p>One question I was asked: <em><a href="#">Why continuous integration if I’m just a hobbyist?</a></em>  I have two answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Test-Driven Development with Python</em> by Harry Percival recommends it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Rather than let that happen, we can automate the running of functional tests by setting up a “Continuous Integration” or CI server. That way, in day-to-day development, we can just run the FT that we’re working on at that time, and rely on the CI server to run all the tests automatically and let us know if we’ve broken anything accidentally. The unit tests should stay fast enough that we can keep running them every few seconds.”</p>
<p>Excerpt From: Harry Percival. “Test-Driven Development with Python.” Apple Books.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s cool.  And that’s the real reason.  Having the little “Azure Pipelines Succeeded” badge on the Github
repo page; hooking up the Slack integration to get a message when a build builds or fails; and knowing I’m doing
things like a “real” developer might.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But I digress.  I set up Azure Pipelines to run two builds - one in Python 3.6 and one in Python 3.7.  After I make a commit to the SilverSaucer Github repository, Azure Pipelines automatically starts a job and builds the project.</p>
<p><img src="/images/failed-builds.png" alt="Azure Builds"></p>
<p>Two of the four tests passed.</p>
<p>The good news:  The two tests using Python 3.6 pass and it builds!</p>
<p>The bad news:  The exact same two tests fail on Python 3.7. (<a href="https://gist.github.com/prcutler/2d2aa67280600f183cd27609b48af4e8">Log</a>)</p>
<p>I made sure my development machine’s version of Python matched Azure’s and upgraded from Python 3.7.1 to 3.7.3
just to make sure - still failed.</p>
<p>I poked at it here and there for a few days and then asked for help in the Pyramid IRC channel.  Right away, I received advice to add <code>pysqlite3</code> and it worked!  I used <code>pip freeze</code> to update
my <code>requirements.txt</code> file and made sure <code>pysqlite3</code> was in there, committed, and now I have a shiny badge on my repo.</p>
<p>I still don’t understand <em>why</em> it built on Python 3.6 but not Python 3.7.  But it’s working and time to move on.</p>
<p><em>Coming in part 3:  Hooking up Dependabot and the Python 3.7 builds fail again.</em></p>

            <description>Introduction I’m still on my quest to learn more Python and at the top of that list is learning pytest. I just can’t wrap my head around testing and I know my two Pyramid apps aren’t “complete” until there are tests. (I did write docs, so I have that going for me).
A couple months ago I (very easily) added continuous integration to NFLPool using Microsoft’s Azure Pipelines. I, like many other people, have been blown away by the right turn Microsoft made a few years back to embrace open source, and wanted to give Azure Pipelines a try.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’m still on my quest to learn more Python and at the top of that list is learning <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a>.  I just <a href="https://paulcutler.org/blog/learning-how-to-test-in-python-and-pyramid/">can’t wrap my head around testing</a> and I know my two Pyramid apps aren’t “complete” until there are tests.  (I did write docs, so I have that going for me).</p>
<p>A couple months ago I (very easily) added continuous integration to NFLPool using Microsoft’s <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/">Azure Pipelines</a>.  I, like many other people, have been blown away by the right turn Microsoft made a few years back to embrace open source, and wanted to give Azure Pipelines a try.  Every time I make a commit or <a href="https://pyup.io/">Pyup.io</a> submits a pull request to update a Python package, Azure Pipelines builds NFLPool.  Of course it fails, because the tests I’ve written so far fail.  To end this cycle, I really need to learn how to write tests!</p>
<p>I have a domain I don’t use, silversaucer.com.  I have a few different ideas for some projects for the domain.  I’m going to build another web app using <a href="https://www.trypyramid.com">Pyramid</a> to start, with a goal of properly using classes in Pyramid (and not Pyramid handlers) to start.  I’ve also been reading <a href="https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/">Test-Driven Development with Python, 2nd Edition</a>, that I received from a recent Humble Bundle filled with Python books.</p>
<p>I was thinking that this was a perfect opportunity to learn <code>pytest</code>.  I would create a new project in Pyramid and use TDD to write my tests as I write my code.  If I’m going to do that, I might as well set up continuous integration right away and pretend I’m a real developer.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-pyramid">Setting up Pyramid</h2>
<p>Since I’m going to be using a Test Driven Development philosophy, all I’m going to do is create a Pyramid project and not make any changes to it yet.  I used <a href="https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.10-branch/narr/project.html#project-narr">Pyramid’s cookiecutter to create the project</a> and then committed it to my Github repository.  That’s it!</p>
<h2 id="hooking-up-azure-pipelines">Hooking up Azure Pipelines</h2>
<p>Here is where the fun starts.  I’m not going to go through this process as Microsoft has great documentation for Azure and <a href="#">set up</a>.</p>
<p>Walk through the setup and connect to your repository on Github.  Azure Pipelines will create the needed YAML file, commit it and run your first build.</p>
<p>Here is where my build failed for Silver Saucer.  I was getting the following error:</p>
<pre><code>Obtaining silversaucer from git+git@github.com:prcutler/silversaucer.git@75932f389536b59993fa780b281170849ff92238#egg=silversaucer (from -r requirements.txt (line 38))

  Running command git clone -q git@github.com:prcutler/silversaucer.git /home/vsts/work/1/s/src/silversaucer
  Host key verification failed.
  fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
</code></pre>
<p>Here is where I first lost hours over the course of a few days.  Azure is pulling my repository using git, not https.  I would compare this to my Azure Pipeline for NFLPool, which for some reason pulls my repository using https and works fine.  I know a little bit about SSH keys.  I’m no expert, but all of my Digital Ocean and servers at home use SSH key authentication to log in and not passwords (yay me for good opsec!) and I have my SSH key on multiple computers without any issues.</p>
<p>Lots of search queries later, I learned how you can <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-a-remotes-url#switching-remote-urls-from-https-to-ssh">change a git repository’s remote URL</a>, but this appears just to be on your local machine.  I’m sure I’m missing something simple to make it a global change, but I never figured it out.</p>
<p>Ok, let’s add my SSH key to Azure Pipelines.  Again, Microsoft has <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops#configuration">good developer documentation on how to do this</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1:  Add your public key to your Azure profile.</li>
<li>Step 2: In your projects in Azure Pipelines, go to Pipelines -&gt; Library and choose Secure files.  Add your private key (usually <code>id_rsa</code>).</li>
<li>Step 3: Add the SSH Task to Azure Pipelines and make sure you authorize the private key - follow <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/utility/install-ssh-key?view=azure-devops">Microsoft’s developer documentation for the SSH Task</a>.  Update your YAML file:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>	# Install SSH Key
		# Install an SSH key prior to a build or release
		- task: InstallSSHKey@0
		  inputs:
		    hostName: 
		    sshPublicKey: 
		    #sshPassphrase: # Optional
		    sshKeySecureFile: 
</code></pre><p>The hostname input confused me at first, but here you’re going to go into your <code>~/.ssh</code> directory and copy and paste the Github entry in your <code>known_hosts</code> file.  (This is a hidden directory in your home folder on macOS or Linux.  I’m not sure where it is on Windows, sorry!) Paste your public key in <code>sshPublicKey:</code> and the name of your private key that you uploaded in Step 2 above.  If your repository is public on Github, you are not going to want to add your sshPassphrase to your YAML file.</p>
<h2 id="my-ssh-key-fails">My SSH key fails</h2>
<p>Again, I lost hours here.  I have no idea why, but the SSH key I’ve been using for the last couple of years will not work.  I had to create a second SSH key for Azure Pipelines and delete my <code>known_hosts</code> file, clone the repository again (which then updated <code>known_hosts</code>) and paste in the new fingerprint from <code>known_hosts</code> to the YAML file.  The new key works fine, but I’ll be damned if I can figure out why my normal key doesn’t work.  I’ve compared the fingerprint of my usual key, used it to clone other repositories, but Azure Pipelines refuses to work with it as I would just receive the above error over and over again.</p>
<p>I’m not thrilled with having a second SSH key, and now I have to go to the other two computers I work with and copy it over and add it to my keyring.  But it works.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>
<p>Coming up in Part 2:  Pytest works in Azure Pipelines in Python 3.6 (but not Python 3.7!)</p>

            <description>It was a good week for Python and me.
In no particular order:
MLBPool2 I pushed a major re-write of MLBPool2 to production just days before the baseball season ended. Why didn’t I wait until the baseball season was over before pushing a major update? Because MySportsFeeds this summer upgraded their API from 1.x to 2.0 and it included a big change to how they track team standings, especially playoff standings.</description>

<p>I pushed a major re-write of <a href="https://mlbpool2.com">MLBPool2</a> to production just days before the baseball season ended.  Why didn’t I wait until the baseball season was over before pushing a major update?  Because <a href="https://mysportsfeeds.com">MySportsFeeds</a> this summer upgraded their API from 1.x to 2.0 and it included a big change to how they track team standings, especially playoff standings.  To give MLBPool2 players better visibility to how they were doing, it was important to get the update out there.  There were a few more things pushed in that update which deserve their own write-up.</p>
<h2 id="100-days-of-python">100 Days of Python</h2>
<p>I started the <a href="https://talkpython.fm/100days">100 Days of Python training</a> from <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm">Talk Python</a> and <a href="https://pybit.es/">Pybites</a>.  The first couple of days are training on the  ```datetime <code>module, which just reinforced to me how much more I like </code>Pendulum`.  I haven’t been updating the daily log (or tweeting), but I have been working on Python daily.</p>
<h2 id="pyramid-documentation">Pyramid Documentation</h2>
<p>I mentioned in my last blog post a few weeks ago how I’ve been learning about testing.  One of the things I noticed when reading up on <a href="https://trypyramid.com">Pyramid</a> and <code>pytest </code> was that the Pyramid documentation refers to <code>pytest</code> as <code>py.test</code> in its documentation, which is an old way of doing it.</p>
<p>GitHub and partners started <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> this week, so it was a perfect time to go through all of the Pyramid documentation and update it.  So I did, and it was a good learning opportunity.  It’s not as simple as an easy search and replace - reading through the docs to make sure the changes are done right also teaches me about the features, and learning about <code>pytest</code> and especially <code>coverage</code> was great.  Talking to the developers, Pyramid has a 1.10 release coming very soon, so I got those changes in and then dived into another discussion topic on IRC, <em>cookiecutters</em>.</p>
<p>With the upcoming 1.10 release, Pyramid will be merging three of it’s cookiecutters into one.  Even though we’ll update the documentation, including the README, there are probably some developers who have a workflow to just pull the cookiecutter from the command line.  I added a message to the two deprecated cookiecutters that they are deprecated and to use the correct one.  I did spend some time going through the Talk Python course on cookiecutters, which was good, too.  I was looking for a way to update the pre-commit hook to add the deprecation message, but no luck on that.</p>
<p>And speaking of Hacktoberfest, I met the goals!  (Not that I’m done yet).</p>
<p>It was a good week.</p>

If you’ve taken both the Python for Entrepreneurs course and the Building Data Driven Web Apps with Pyramid this might help you write tests using the Python for Entrepreneurs code.  And if you’ve taken courses at Talk Python, take advantage of the office hours!</em></p>
<p>I don’t get testing in Python at all.  I don’t have a computer science degree and Python is a hobby for me.  I’ve learned enough Python to build two apps with Pyramid, but I didn’t write any tests. (Shame on me!) I was lucky enough to be asked to review <a href="http://pythontesting.net/">Brian Okken’s</a> <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/bopytest/python-testing-with-pytest">Python Testing with pytest</a> book last year, and after reading the first few chapters, it was way over my head and I had to apologetically let him know I just didn’t have the knowledge to review it.  I’ve read dozens of articles on testing, but nothing I’ve come across explains what to test, much less how to start it.</p>
<p>I’ve already raved about the training courses from <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm">Talk Python</a> and I finally bought the Everything Bundle this summer.  So when Michael Kennedy launched his latest course, <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/building-data-driven-web-applications-in-python-with-pyramid-sqlalchemy-and-bootstrap">Building data-driven web apps with Pyramid and SQLAlchemy</a>, which includes a chapter on testing, I was pumped.  (That, and how to build a Pyramid app using classes and not the <code>pyramid_handlers</code> module, but that’s a different blog post for a different time).</p>
<p>I decided to jump around a bit in the training and dive into the tests portion of it.  What worked:  Things started to click.  The training and his code showed how to write some tests to test the views and routes within a web application.  I learn best by seeing the code examples and following along with the training, so this was exciting.  Learning the “3 A’s of Testing (Arrange, Act and then Assert) was big - not once in any of the articles I’ve read on the web did I come across those terms.</p>
<p>What didn’t work:  Using the code examples to test against my two existing Pyramid applications (<a href="https://github.com/prcutler/nflpool">NFLPool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/mlbpool2">MLBPool2</a>).  The first reason is because I’m using the <code>pyramid_handlers</code> module (which is now not supported) and this latest course does not use this package.  The second reason is that one of the tests you write tests the whole web application - but as part of the Python for Entrepreneurs course, I had enabled other functionality, such as sending emails, Rollbar for errors, and a few other things.  The Building Data Driven Web Apps course mentions that you might have to pass some variables to the test to get it to work, but I didn’t have any luck.</p>
<p>But! But! If you’ve purchased training courses from Mr. Kennedy, he offers office hours if you need help with the training courses.  These are not consultation sessions, your questions have to be related to the course, and he was kind enough to probably bend the rules slightly to help me get up and running tests with my existing applications.  After spending a few hours trying to write the tests over the weekend, I was lucky that office hours were this past Monday over my lunch hour.  He publishes the code examples on Github, so I don’t think there’s a problem with me sharing some of these code snippets.  (And by blogging about this, I’m hoping to help commit it to memory as well, as well as help anyone who has also taken both courses).</p>
<h2 id="testing-registration">Testing Registration</h2>
<p>Let’s look at testing the <code>Account</code> methods, from the <a href="https://github.com/talkpython/data-driven-web-apps-with-pyramid-and-sqlalchemy/tree/master/src/ch14-testing/final/pypi_testing/pypi/tests">Github repo from the course</a>.  If you click the link, you’ll see that there are three tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test that registering an account works</li>
<li>Test that an account already exists</li>
<li>Test that a user didn’t submit their email address when registering</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I was having problems, I was just trying to do one at a time, starting with the last one.  Here you’re going to test that an email address was not entered as part of creating an account:</p>
<pre><code>import unittest
import unittest.mock
import pyramid.testing


class AccountControllerTests(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_register_validation_no_email(self):
        # Arrange
        from pypi.viewmodels.account.register_viewmodel import RegisterViewModel
        request = pyramid.testing.DummyRequest()
        request.POST = {
            'email': '',
            'password': 'a'
        }
        # noinspection PyTypeChecker
        vm = RegisterViewModel(request)

        # Act
        vm.validate()

        # Assert:
        self.assertIsNotNone(vm.error)
        self.assertTrue('email' in vm.error)
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>unitest</code>, we’ll import the <code>RegisterViewModel</code>, which defines what’s needed for an account - a name, an email address, and a password.  Pyramid has some testing built into it, so you call the <code>pyramid.testing.DummyRequest()</code> and pass it a <code>POST</code> that includes a password, but no email.  You then pass that request to the <code>RegisterViewModel</code> which has a <a href="https://github.com/talkpython/data-driven-web-apps-with-pyramid-and-sqlalchemy/blob/master/src/ch14-testing/final/pypi_testing/pypi/viewmodels/account/register_viewmodel.py">method to validate</a> the information is correct:</p>
<pre><code>    def validate(self):
        if not self.email:
            self.error = 'You must specify an email address.'
        elif not self.name:
            self.error = 'You must specify your name.'
        elif not self.password:
            self.error = 'You must specify a password.'
        elif user_service.find_user_by_email(self.email):
            self.error = &quot;This user already exists!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>But when I ran that test on NFLPool, I kept receiving an error:
<code>TypeError: __init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given'</code></p>
<p>Let’s look at what Michael showed me that does work:</p>
<pre><code>import unittest
import unittest.mock
import pyramid.testing


class AccountControllerTests(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_register_validation_no_email(self):
        # Arrange
        from nflpool.viewmodels.register_viewmodel import RegisterViewModel

        data = {
            'first_name': 'Paul',
            'last_name': 'Cutler',
            'email': '',
            'password': 'Aa123456@',
            'confirm_password': 'Aa123456@'
        }
        # noinspection PyTypeChecker
        vm = RegisterViewModel()
        vm.from_dict(data)

        # Act
        vm.validate()

        # Assert:
        self.assertIsNotNone(vm.error)
        self.assertTrue('email' in vm.error)
</code></pre>
<p>If you’ve taken the Python for Entrepreneurs course, you need to do it slightly different.  The NFLPool app requires a couple more fields for registration, which is what you see in the <code>data</code> dictionary created in the test above.  You then pass that <code>data</code> dictionary to the view model using <code>vm.from_dict(data)</code> instead, and the run the <code>validate</code> method.</p>
<p>And look what you get!
Ran 1 test in 0.566s</p>
<pre><code>OK
0

Process finished with exit code 0
</code></pre>
<p>It worked!   I still have some work to do with one of the three included tests, as I require my users to create a strong password, so I need to re-write my test to account for that, but the other two tests worked for me.</p>
<p>One last note for the other two tests - the Python for Entrepreneurs course uses a class in the <code>AccountService</code> and Data Driven course does not.  You need to account for this when assigning a target for the test.</p>
<p>From the Data Driven course:</p>
<pre><code>`target = 'pypi.services.user_service.find_user_by_email'
</code></pre>
<p>For Python for Entrepreneurs it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>`target = 'nflpool.services.account_service.AccountService.find_account_by_email'
</code></pre>
<h2 id="testing-the-pyramid-app">Testing the Pyramid App</h2>
<p>Testing the entire Pyramid App turned out a bit trickier and I owe Michael a debt of gratitude as I would have never figured this out.  The Python for Entrepreneurs class has you include Rollbar (for error reporting) as well as setting up logging.  I did get the below test to run, but I had to comment out these things in NFLPool’s <code>__init__.py</code> which kind of defeats the purpose of testing.  (But hey, I was learning and it was good to validate I could get a test to run).</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/talkpython/data-driven-web-apps-with-pyramid-and-sqlalchemy/blob/master/src/ch14-testing/final/pypi_testing/pypi/tests/home_tests.py">Data Driven web course, to test the app it looks like</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import unittest
import pyramid.testing


class HomeControllerTests(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        from pypi import main
        app = main({})
        # noinspection PyPackageRequirements
        from webtest import TestApp
        self.app = TestApp(app)

    def test_home_page(self):
        # noinspection PyPackageRequirements
        import webtest.response
        response: webtest.response.TestResponse = self.app.get('/', status=200)

self.assertTrue(b'Find, install and publish Python packages' in response.body)
</code></pre>
<p>But if you’ve built an app using Python for Entrepreneurs, you need to do a couple things.</p>
<p>First, create a <code>web_settings.py</code> file and add:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import configparser

config = configparser.ConfigParser()
folder = os.path.dirname(__file__)
file = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(folder, '..', '..', 'development.ini'))

config.read(file)
main = config['app:nflpool']
rollbar = config['rollbar:test_settings']

settings = {**main, **rollbar}
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to change the line
main = config[&lsquo;app:nflpool&rsquo;]
so the app name equals your app’s name.</p>
<p>Open your Pyramid dunder init file and update your logging configuration with an <code>if / else</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>def init_logging(config):
    settings = config.get_settings()
    if settings.get('logging') == 'OFF':
        log_filename = None
    else:
        log_filename = settings.get('log_filename', '')
    log_level = settings.get('log_level', 'ERROR')

    LogService.global_init(log_level, log_filename)

    log_package_versions()
</code></pre>
<p>And add the if / else statement.  You’ve now accounted for both Rollbar and you won’t create a log in your <code>tests</code> directory when running this test.</p>
<p>Lastly, you need to update your <code>development.ini</code> file to account for the Rollbar changes.  Comment out the <code>rollbar.root</code> below so you don’t receive notifications for errors in development and add the <code>[rollbar:test_settings]</code> block below.</p>
<pre><code>#  Rollbar settings

rollbar.access_token = YOUR_TOKEN
rollbar.environment = dev
rollbar.branch = master
# rollbar.root = %(here)s

[rollbar:test_settings]

rollbar_js_id = NONE
rollbar.access_token = NONE
rollbar.environment = dev
rollbar.branch = master
rollbar.root = blank
</code></pre>
<p>That’s it!  Hopefully I haven’t missed anything.  I’m excited to start writing tests for my two apps and I have a lot to write.  Once I get my head wrapped around these tests, the next phase will be to see if I can migrate some of them to <code>pytest</code> - but one thing at a time.  (And then finally review Mr. Okken’s book, too!)</p>

            <description>Alternative title: There is No Offseason (or writing my Python apps never ends and that&amp;rsquo;s ok) The blogging might slow down some, but the coding never stops. Ok, well maybe a little. After creating and launching MLBPool2 this past spring, I took a small break and then back at it for the upcoming season of NFLPool.
I have two big goals for NFLPool before the 2018 season starts:
 Fix the time / timezone issue where a player tried to submit his picks before the first game of the season started to, but was denied.</description>

<p>I have two big goals for NFLPool before the 2018 season starts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fix the time / timezone issue where a player tried to submit his picks before the first game of the season started to, but was denied.  Rip out all references to Python’s <code>datetime</code> module and replace it with the <code>Pendulum</code> module instead.</li>
<li>Allow NFLPool players to make changes to their picks if the season hasn’t started yet.  This build on existing functionality in MLBPool2.</li>
</ol>
<p>And a few smaller things to add including some updated admin functionality.  I didn’t get to a few of the big things I wanted to do this offseason, which included unit tests and porting to MySQL.  But it’s good to have goals for next offseason.</p>
<p>I’ll be writing about some of the changes over the few weeks leading up to this season’s kickoff.</p>

            <description>Humble Bundle has done it again. They’ve released an awesome bundle of Python trainings, books and tools all for a low price and also supports charity!
Included in the bundle are three trainings from Talk Python (which I’ve already raved about a lot). I’ve been an ardent supporter of Talk Python trainings and have recommended them numerous times on the Python subreddits, and usually get comments that they’re so expensive (when compared to Udemy’s “sale prices” of $13).</description>

I’ve been an ardent supporter of Talk Python trainings and have recommended them numerous times on the Python subreddits, and usually get comments that they’re so expensive (when compared to Udemy’s “sale prices” of $13).  But they’re worth every penny and now people have a chance to get three of them for just $20.</p>
<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more!  Fluent Python, which I have not read, but is almost always one of the most highly recommended books for intermediate Python programmers and up is also included.  Dan Bader’s Python Tricks book, Matt Harrison’s Illustrated Guide to Python 3 and Thoughtful Machine Learning by Matthew Kirk are also included.  I’m personally excited to get Matt Harrison’s book - Talk Python launched a new training this week and if you buy it within the first week that book is included.  I’m going to buy the Talk Python Everything Bundle in a month, so I would have missed out on the promo to get the book, but now I get it anyway!</p>
<p>You also can get a number of software tools.  A 1 year subscription of Postman Pro is included - I’ve used the free version since Talk Python introduced it to me.  It’s been fantastic for learning the MySportsFeeds API and looking through rows and rows of JSON.  I’m curious to see what the Pro version brings.  GitKracken looks interesting, but PyUp is one I really want to try out.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, is a 6 month subscription to <a href="https://egghead.io/">egghead.io</a>, featuring video tutorials to learn JavaScript.  I wanted to get better at Python before learning JavaScript, but this makes starting to learn it a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Even though I have two of the three Talk Python trainings in the bundle, a PyCharm Pro license and am an existing DigitalOcean customer, it’s still an unbelievable deal.  <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/software/python-dev-kit-bundle">Go get it now</a>!  (Not an affiliate link).</p>

            <description>When I first learned to work with Pyramid thanks to the Talk Python course Python for Entrepreneurs, I used the account registration system directly from the course for NFLPool. When I wrote MLBPool2, I augmented it to require the user to use a much stronger password than the course taught. (You can see the original code from NFLPool here).
In MLBPool2, I required the user to use a password between 8 and 24 characters and it must have at least one lowercase letter, at least one upper case letter, a number, and a symbol:</description>

When I wrote MLBPool2, I augmented it to require the user to use a much stronger password than the course taught.  (You can see the original code from <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/nflpool/blob/master/nflpool/viewmodels/register_viewmodel.py">NFLPool here</a>).</p>
<p>In MLBPool2, I required the user to use a password between 8 and 24 characters and it must have at least one lowercase letter, at least one upper case letter, a number, and a symbol:</p>
<pre><code>    def validate(self):
        self.error = None

        symbol = ['!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&amp;', '*', '(', ')', '-', '_', '+', '=', ',', '.', '&lt;', '&gt;'
                  '?', &quot;/&quot;]

        if self.password != self.confirm_password:
            self.error = &quot;The password and confirmation don't match&quot;
            return

        print(len(self.password))

        if len(self.password) &lt;= 7:
            self.error = 'You must enter a password with at least eight characters'
            return

        if len(self.password) &gt;= 24:
            self.error = 'Your password must be 24 characters or less'

        if not any(char in symbol for char in self.password):
            self.error = 'Your password should have at least one of the symbol (!, @, #, $, %, ^, &amp;, *, (, ), _, -, '' \
            ''=, +, ,, &lt;, ., &gt;, /, ?)'

        if not any(char.isdigit() for char in self.password):
            self.error = 'Your password have at least one number'

        if not any(char.isupper() for char in self.password):
            self.error = 'Your password should have at least one uppercase letter'

        if not any(char.islower() for char in self.password):
            self.error = 'Your password should have at least one lowercase letter'

        if not self.password:
            self.error = &quot;You must specify a password&quot;
            return

        if not self.email:
            self.error = &quot;You must specify an email address&quot;
return
</code></pre>
<p>A nice error message is shown each time the user doesn’t do it correctly.  I was pretty proud of myself for figuring this out (and for using Stack Overflow to get some tips on how to do it).</p>
<p>But…. It hit me a couple weeks ago that it works great for user registration, but if they lose their password or want to reset it, none of that functionality is there.  When resetting a password, the user clicks the reset password link which emails them a one-time link to reset their password.  And none of the password requirements I was so proud of are in the methods for resetting a password.</p>
<p>It’s going to require a big re-write - right now it only has one input field for the new password.  I’ll need to add a second field to require the user to enter the new password twice (similar to registration) and then add all of the requirements and the error messages to the viewmodel. So I’ll be working on that over the next week or so.</p>

            <title>NFLPool - The Work Continues</title>

            <description>For once in my life, I’m not procrastinating. With the NFL season just over four and a half months away, I’ve already started on working to update NFLPool.
I’m really enjoying working with Python and don’t want to let the few things I’ve learned get rusty. This includes back porting a number of updates from MLBPool2.
I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the Standings page to display all seasons played (before it defaulted to just the current season).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For once in my life, I’m not procrastinating.  With the NFL season just over four and a half months away, I’ve already started on working to update <a href="https://nflpool.xyz">NFLPool</a>.</p>
<p>I’m really enjoying working with Python and don’t want to let the few things I’ve learned get rusty.  This includes back porting a number of updates from <a href="https://www.mlbpool2.com">MLBPool2</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve updated the Standings page to display all seasons played (before it defaulted to just the current season).  This uses traversal in Pyramid to create a GET request based on the season year and automatically creates the links.  This feature within Pyramid is so cool, I guess I should expand on it:</p>
<p>I have a <code>standings_controller.py</code> that creates all of the routes for the pages in Standings:</p>
<pre><code>class StandingsController(BaseController):
    @pyramid_handlers.action(renderer='templates/standings/standings.pt')
    def index(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Get a list of all seasons played from the database and display a bulleted list for the user to
        choose which season to view standings for&quot;&quot;&quot;
        seasons_played = StandingsService.all_seasons_played()

        return {'seasons': seasons_played}
</code></pre><p>I call the StandingsService to get a list of all the seasons that exist in the database to create the index page and it shows a bullet list of each season.  (Currently, this returns the one season that has been played, 2017).  You can <a href="https://nflpool.xyz/standings">see it in action here</a>.</p>
<p>You can then click on the <em>2017</em> bullet to see the player standings for the 2017 season.  The code for the player standings in each season looks like:</p>
<pre><code>    @pyramid_handlers.action(renderer='templates/standings/season.pt',
                             request_method='GET',
                             name='season')
    def season(self):
        current_standings = StandingsService.display_weekly_standings()

        season = self.request.matchdict['id']

        session = DbSessionFactory.create_session()
        # season_row = session.query(SeasonInfo.current_season).filter(SeasonInfo.id == '1').first()
        # season = season_row.current_season

        week_query = session.query(WeeklyPlayerResults.week).order_by(WeeklyPlayerResults.week.desc()).first()
        week = week_query[0]

        if week &gt;= 17:
            week = 'Final'
        else:
            week = 'Week ' + str(week_query[0])

        return {'current_standings': current_standings, 'season': season, 'week': week}
</code></pre><p>The cool thing is <code>season = self.request.matchdict['id']</code> above - when the user clicks on 2017, that’s passed to this method, that passes <em>2017</em> and makes season equal to whatever bullet the user clicked on in the list on the Standings index page, which is 2017 in this example and returns the 2017 Standings.  The rest of the code passes the <code>season</code> variable (which is now 2017) to the database to show all of the players and their score for the 2017 season.  I also updated the template that if the week is 17 or greater (there are only 17 weeks in an NFL season), the header on the page now says <em>2017 Final Standings</em>, otherwise it would return <em>2017 Week x Standings</em>, where x is equal to whatever week the standings have been updated through.  This was helpful as last year there was an issue with how division standings were pulled from MySportsFeeds because they don’t calculate the tiebreakers in their API and they had to fix it - after they fixed it, I updated the stats from their API, but now it was “Week 18”, which technically doesn’t exist in the NFL.  Now it just says final.</p>
<p>I also added Slack messaging that is present in MLBPool2.  When a new user registers or submits their picks, I get a message in my NFLPool Slack channel.</p>
<p>A minor thing, but when players are selecting the NFL player they think will win in a category (such as who has the most passing yards), the dropdown box that shows a list of all NFL players now includes the player’s team and position in addition to the player’s name.  Another small thing is the site administrator can update when a player has paid the annual league fee and when the admin updates to a new season the list players who have paid is reset.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, I’ve been working on documentation.  I had already written the User Guide on how to play and make your picks, and over the last week I’ve added an Administrator’s Guide, including how to install, first time setup, how to update to a new season and how to manage NFLPool players.  This is all written in reStructured Text and uses Sphinx to create the documentation and is hosted on <a href="http://nflpool.readthedocs.io/">ReadTheDocs</a>.  I still need to write the developer documentation - I have no idea how to write developer docs and am still looking for some good examples of developer documentation to crib from.</p>
<p>It’s a good thing I’m using <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/nflpool/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aall+">Github’s issue tracker</a> - a couple of those fixes above I had added last September after NFLPool launched and probably would have forgotten about.  Between that and the documentation, it’s almost like I’m running a real open source project!</p>
<p>The work doesn’t end there, though.  The big one I need to add the TimeService and GamedayService to make datetime management easier, especially for calculating when picks are due and displaying it on the pick submission page.  I also have a couple of more bug fixes to get to and I’d like to add Twitter support to the app as well.  The journey never ends.</p>

            <description>I’ve been using Wordpressfor over 15 years. In fact, I started blogging before Wordpress existed, and even used b2 / cafelog, from which Wordpress was forked.
But over the last couple of years as I’ve maintained three separate Wordpress sites (the first for paulcutler.org, then Stone Open, and later MLBPool2 (which is now using Pyramid instead), I’ve had constant crashes and memory issues. I don’t know if it’s because of the number of blog posts I have, but both my personal blog and Stone Open have tables corrupted and I have to go in and fix them whenever the site crashes.</description>

<p>But over the last couple of years as I’ve maintained three separate Wordpress sites (the first for paulcutler.org, then <a href="http://www.stoneopen.com">Stone Open</a>, and later MLBPool2 (which is now using Pyramid instead), I’ve had constant crashes and memory issues.  I don’t know if it’s because of the number of blog posts I have, but both my personal blog and Stone Open have tables corrupted and I have to go in and fix them whenever the site crashes.</p>
<p>That, combined with the constant updates for Wordpress and it’s plugins, as well as security fixes, made me say enough is enough.</p>
<p>I’ve been looking at <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> (written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>) for the last month or so to replace Wordpress with.  I also looked briefly looked at Jekyll and <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, which are also both static site generators.  Pelican interested me, as it is written in Python, but Hugo seems to be a bit more actively maintained.</p>
<p>As of this morning, paulcutler.org is now running Hugo.  I updated the web server, installed a new SSL certificate (thanks <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>!) and moved it to my other DigitalOcean droplet that serves <a href="https://mlbpool2.com">MLBPool2.com</a> and <a href="https://nflpool.xyz">NFLPool.xyz</a>.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of using Hugo is that all of the blog posts are written with Markdown.  I’ve been using Markdown more and more, as most of the daily apps I use on macOS use Markdown (<a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a>, <a href="https://bear-writer.com">Bear Notes</a>, and <a href="https://www.ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a> (which I’m using to write this now with).</p>
<p>I’m a little worried I’m going to lose some Google search magic for the old URLs, but we’ll see.  I also need to see if this theme I’m using has search functionality to use.  The site should be faster now as there is no database in the middle and I’m just serving static HTML pages.  I’m sure I’ll continue to tweak it over time as I learn more about Hugo.  Now to get automated deployment working!</p>

            <description>I’ve been blogging a little bit about MLBPool2 the last couple of weeks and now the last three months of work is complete.
I already touched on two of the biggest differences between NFLPool and MLBPool2 (the time service using Pendulum and using MySQL / MariaDB instead of SQLite).
The biggest difference between NFLPool and MLBPool2 though is players have the ability to change their picks. At the All-Star Break, MLBPool2 players can change up to 14 of their 37 picks, but those changes are only worth half points.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been blogging a little bit about MLBPool2 the last couple of weeks and now the last three months of work is complete.</p>
<p>I already touched on two of the biggest differences between NFLPool and MLBPool2 (the time service using Pendulum and using MySQL / MariaDB instead of SQLite).</p>
<p>The biggest difference between NFLPool and MLBPool2 though is players have the ability to change their picks. At the All-Star Break, MLBPool2 players can change up to 14 of their 37 picks, but those changes are only worth half points.</p>
<p>This required a major re-write in the way I capture and store each player’s picks. I also figured, based on how NFLPool went when I launched it, if a player was going to be able to change their picks at the All-Star Break, I might as well let them change their picks before the season starts. (I had a couple NFLPool players request to make a change, which required me to delete all their picks from the database and I just told them to do it again. But I <strong>hate</strong> touching the database.). I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/mlbpool2/blob/master/mlbpool/services/gameday_service.py">new service</a> (<code>gameday_service.py</code>) that the app uses to figure out a few different things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Season start</li>
<li>When picks are due</li>
<li>The All-Star Break (48 hours before and after the All-Star Game)</li>
<li>Season end</li>
</ul>
<p>I already was using two methods – one for the initial picks submission and one for changes in the <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/mlbpool2/blob/master/mlbpool/services/playerpicks_service.py">PlayerPicks service</a>. If the player was changing their picks, I used an if / else statement that compared the current time to when the season started:</p>
<pre><code>now_time = TimeService.get_time()

if GameDayService.season_opener_date() &gt; now_time:
&quot;&quot;&quot;Update the picks passed from change-picks. If the season start date is later than the current time,
make the new changed picks equal to the original picks, making original_pick equal to the new pick.&quot;&quot;&quot;

Update Pick Type 1
Update the AL East Winner Pick - check to see if it has been changed
if al_east_winner_pick != session.query(PlayerPicks).filter(PlayerPicks.user_id == user_id) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.season == season) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.pick_type == 1) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.rank == 1) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.league_id == 0) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.division_id == 1):
session.query(PlayerPicks).filter(PlayerPicks.user_id == user_id).filter(PlayerPicks.pick_type == 1) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.season == season) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.rank == 1) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.league_id == 0) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.division_id == 1) \
.update({&quot;team_id&quot;: al_east_winner_pick, &quot;date_submitted&quot;: now_time,
&quot;original_pick&quot;: al_east_winner_pick})
</code></pre>
<p>And do a <code>session.update</code> to update the database.</p>
<p>But if it’s during the All-Star Break we need to capture that the pick has been changed (changing the value in the PlayerPicks table from 0 to 1) where the UniquePicks service will credit the player with half points:</p>
<pre><code>else:
&quot;&quot;&quot;If the season has started, update picks at the All-Star Break. Do not change the original pick column
and update the changed column to 1.&quot;&quot;&quot;

Update the AL East Winner Pick
for pick in session.query(PlayerPicks.team_id).filter(PlayerPicks.user_id == user_id) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.season == season) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.pick_type == 1) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.rank == 1) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.league_id == 0) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.division_id == 1).first():

if pick != int(al_east_winner_pick):
session.query(PlayerPicks).filter(PlayerPicks.user_id == user_id) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.pick_type == 1) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.rank == 1).filter(PlayerPicks.league_id == 0) \
.filter(PlayerPicks.division_id == 1) \
.update({&quot;team_id&quot;: al_east_winner_pick, &quot;date_submitted&quot;: now_time, &quot;changed&quot;: 1, &quot;multiplier&quot;: 1})
</code></pre>
<p>When the change picks form is submitted, all 37 picks are sent from the form to the POST and viewmodel. In the controller, I checked if the number of changes was greater than 14 and would redirect them to an error page. But if there were 14 or less changes, the above code would run. If the new pick was not equal to the pick stored in the database, we’d update the pick, capture the time the player submitted changes and flag that the pick was changed. The code works, but there are 36 blocks like the one above – I couldn’t figure out a method that would work where I could pass it parameters. (36, not 37 as the tiebreaker pick can never be changed). But the key is that it works.</p>
<p>The multiplier is reset to 1 – if their original pick had qualified for the <a href="https://mlbpool2.com/rules">double points bonus</a>, it needs to reset back to one as the UniquePicks service is re-run after the All-Star Break and then will assign a multiplier of 2 if the new pick qualifies for the double points bonus.</p>
<p>I plan on porting the code to allow a player to change their picks before the season starts to NFLPool to make the player’s life easier. But really, it’s to make mine easier as I don’t want to have to manually delete their picks from the database.</p>

            <description>I deployed MLBPool2 on Monday. I had a flurry of activity over the weekend to fix a scoring bug. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get MLBPool2 to match the 2017 results that were done by hand. I learned that I don’t have the patience to hand enter the picks for 16 players and then all of their All-Star Break changes. I did it three times and every time I would catch a mistake that I made.</description>

No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get MLBPool2 to match the 2017 results that were done by hand. I learned that I don’t have the patience to hand enter the picks for 16 players and then all of their All-Star Break changes. I did it three times and every time I would catch a mistake that I made. And with the way the UniquePicks service works, one mistake is all it takes to throw off the entire score. I also decided to add the ability to add an administrator and let him or her update the database if a player had paid the league fee.</p>
<p>Once that was done, it was time to test my mediocre (at best) sysadmin skills. Adding the server blocks to nginx was easier than expected and it took me a half hour to figure out why the app wasn’t loading – when using nginx with Waitress for the wsgi server, the app name has to be an exact match. (Note to self: The app name is mlbpool, not mlbpool2).</p>
<p>I changed the DNS to point from one DigitalOcean droplet to another and Let’s Encrypt made it a breeze to get a new SSL certificate. (Of course https is served by default. I haven’t been a member of the EFF for 14 years for nothing).</p>
<p>The database hasn’t crashed yet, so I’m hopeful all my <code>session.close()</code> statements are where they should be, though Bing’s webcrawler apparently crawls by IP and not domain and I woke up to a Rollbar notification of an error thanks to Bing looking for a URL on NFLPool.</p>
<p>It’s been fun having Slack notifications for when a new user registers and makes their picks and seeing those roll in.</p>
<p>But the work doesn’t stop there. Yesterday I wrote user documentation using reStructuredText and Sphinx (yay, another markup language to learn. This is only the fourth language I’ve used to write user help.). I created an account on Read the Docs, connected my Github repo, and voila! <a href="http://mlbpool2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">User documentation for MLBPool2</a> on how to create and manage an account, now to submit and change picks, league rules and scoring. This was all just a precursor to what I really want to do, which is write the developer documentation.</p>
<p>I also started working on tests for MLBPool2. I’m still so confused on testing, specifically what tests I need to right to improve code coverage. But I successfully wrote my first test using <code>pytest</code> today – just a small one to check the MySportsFeed API and make sure it’s up and returns a 200 status code. Baby steps.</p>
<p>I’ve already filed a bug and a couple of enhancements that I want to work on once the season is over. When I set out to learn Python to build these apps, I did it because I wanted a hobby, and I sure have one now.</p>

            <description>A few years ago I started to look into how I could build apps to manage MLBPool and NFLPool. The key would be how to integrate all of the team and player statistics and where to get that data. I was floored when I saw the pricing of how much companies charge to provide those stats – it was hundreds to thousands of dollars per month to get access to baseball or football stats.</description>

The key would be how to integrate all of the team and player statistics and where to get that data. I was floored when I saw the pricing of how much companies charge to provide those stats – it was hundreds to thousands of dollars per month to get access to baseball or football stats. The closer you got to real time statistics, the more it was. Most of these companies are providing statistics to commercial services that run fantasy leagues (I’m guessing), which is why fantasy leagues charge a fee to host your fantasy league.</p>
<p>It’s been a couple years now and I don’t remember how I came across <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/">MySportsFeeds</a>, but they offer a <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/feed-pricing/">commercial service</a> for companies like I mentioned above, but they also have a key differentiator. For educational purposes, developers or research, they offer a free service to access stats for completed seaons. Best of all, you can also subscribe for a very low price to their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mysportsfeeds">Patreon</a> to get access to live data. I’m happy to say I was one of the first Patreon subscribers and for $5 / month I get access with a 3 minute delay. (I really only need data overnight and not real time for my apps, but what an awesome price). MySportsFeeds currently offers statistics for the NHL, NBA, MLB and NFL and statistics are available in JSON, XML or CSV.</p>
<p>There are a few different things I love. One, there is a <a href="https://mysportsfeeds-slackinvite.herokuapp.com/">Slack channel</a> where the owner and lead developer, Brad Barkhouse, helps out. He’s extremely responsive to community questions and is always around. Two, the service is always getting better. Last summer they launched <a href="https://github.com/mysportsfeeds">wrapper libraries</a> for popular programming languages including Python, Ruby, R, NodeJS and more. Three, they have fantastic documentation that includes all the parameters you can pass to the different feeds to help filter what information or statistics you might need.</p>
<p>There are a couple quirks. For NFLPool, the Team Standings feeds don’t account for tiebreakers. I can’t fault them for that as the NFL tiebreaker calculations can be complex. After the NFL season ended, I pinged Mr. Barkhouse and he quickly updated the feed to match the NFL standings, which I needed for my app.</p>
<p>In baseball, I started to enter all of the 2017 MLBPool picks for testing. I need to make sure that the app works and matches the scoring that was done by hand last year. When entering picks, one player had chosen <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/darviyu01.shtml">Yu Darvish</a> for one of the pitching categories. When I went to make the pick in MLBPool, he wasn’t available as an American League pitcher. MySportsFeeds showed him on the Los Angeles Dodgers – but he wasn’t traded from the Rangers to the Dodgers until July 31, 2017. Brad will fix his roster information, but MySportsFeeds uses a cumulative player statistics so the feed shows Darvish’s stats for the entire year. But in Major League Baseball by rule, a player’s stats when traded between leagues are NOT cumulative. This is obviously an edge case for MySportsFeeds, but something I’m going to have to account for before MLBPool launches. (I currently store all baseball player statistics in one table – I’m going to need to split this and have two tables, one for the American League and one for the National League to account for this).</p>
<p>MySportsFeeds is under constant development and always improving. Mr. Barkhouse and team updated the API last year from version 1.1 to 1.2 and work is underway for 2.0. They added Daily Fantasy data last year. Users can also file issues in Github or ping him in Slack to get items added to the roadmap. Overall I am extremely happy with the service and highly recommend MySportsFeeds.</p>

            <description>When I wrote yesterday introducing MLBPool2, I buried the lede. One of the biggest changes between NFLPool and MLBPool2 is the fact I’m now using MariaDB and MySQL as the backend instead of SQLite, which NFLPool uses. (I did look at PostgreSQL since so many Python developers seem to prefer it, but I’ve never been able to get a PostgreSQL server up and running on Linux or Mac. My sysadmin skills are nonexistent.</description>

One of the biggest changes between NFLPool and MLBPool2 is the fact I’m now using MariaDB and MySQL as the backend instead of SQLite, which NFLPool uses. (I did look at PostgreSQL since so many Python developers seem to prefer it, but I’ve never been able to get a PostgreSQL server up and running on Linux or Mac. My sysadmin skills are nonexistent.)</p>
<p>Since I’m using SQLAlchemy for 90% of the SQL interactions, setting it up was pretty easy, I just needed to make sure when creating the tables I added things like string length where needed. A basic example that shows the difference between the two is the table that stores the division information. In football, it’s the NFC East, AFC North etc, and in baseball it’s the AL East, NL Central, etc.</p>
<p>In NFLPool it was:</p>
<pre><code>class DivisionInfo(SqlAlchemyBase):
    __tablename__ = 'DivisionInfo'
    division_id = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, primary_key=True)
    division = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.String)
</code></pre>
<p>And in MLBPool2:</p>
<pre><code>class DivisionInfo(SqlAlchemyBase):
    __tablename__ = 'DivisionInfo'
    division_id = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, primary_key=True)
    division = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.String(8))
</code></pre>
<p>Easy enough. But since SQLite is a persistent database, I learned the hard way that I need to close each session in MySQL with a <code>session.close()</code> statement or I see lots of fun errors like this:</p>
<pre><code>OperationalError: (pymysql.err.OperationalError) (1040, 'Too many connections') (Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/e3q8)
</code></pre>
<p>It’s taken a lot of trial and error figuring out where I need these. I’ve learned they have to go before any <code>return</code> statements and even when I think I have them in all the right places, it turns out I don’t. Yesterday I was entering all of the picks for everyone who played in 2017 to do some testing (to see if the app’s results and scores match what was done by hand) and after entering six player’s picks, I ran into it again. Sure enough, in the PlayerPicks service, I didn’t have any <code>session.close()</code> statements when I returned all of the lists that make up the picks. I had just added <a href="https://www.rollbar.com">Rollbar</a> functionality to the site to keep track of errors and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that when you connect Rollbar to your Github repo, it automatically opens an issue for you on Github with the error. (Pretty cool, Rollbar!)</p>
<p>I’m still a little worried that after I deploy and the site has been up for a while that the “Too many connections” error is going to happen.</p>
<p>The other thing I forget to share was a link to the <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/mlbpool2">Github repo for MLBPool2</a>. It’s open source under the MIT X11 license. I originally had NFLPool under the GPL but changed it to MIT as well. I liked the idea of it being under the GPL in case anyone ever used it and I could have access to the changes, but let’s be honest, the chances that anyone is going to use the codebase is slim to none and I’d rather be more permissive (and I have issues with the Free Software Foundation, but no need to get into that.) The key takeaway is I’m a big believer in open source and I think making it more permissive is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I’m undecided if I’m going to port NFLPool to MySQL. I think it’s probably a better option, but the few how-to’s I’ve read give me pause on how to import the data from SQLite to MySQL. I’m not sure if it’s worth the effort considering all of the features I want to back port and / or add to NFLPool. (But that’s a different discussion for a different blog post).</p>

            <description>After learning Python and creating NFLPool, it was time for another project. This time it was building the site for MLBPool2, which inspired NFLPool. MLBPool was the brain child of former commissioner Jason Theros who created the league and rules. Sadly, MLBPool came to an end after the 2011 season. The original site was written in ASP and none of the code was available and for the last few years after my friend resurrected the league he did almost everything by hand.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After learning Python and creating <a href="https://nflpool.xyz">NFLPool</a>, it was time for another project. This time it was building the site for MLBPool2, which inspired NFLPool. MLBPool was the brain child of former commissioner Jason Theros who created the league and rules.  Sadly, MLBPool came to an end after the 2011 season. The original site was written in ASP and none of the code was available and for the last few years after my friend resurrected the league he did almost everything by hand. I had created a Google spreadsheet / form to get all of the player’s pool picks, but scoring was a manual process and he was only able to do it a handful of times throughout the season. I had a WordPress site but as I wasn’t playing in MLBPool2, I never really updated it. (<a href="http://mlbpool2.com/">It’s still up</a> for another week or so – and if you’re curious, you can look at the <a href="http://mlbpool2.com/rules/mlbpool2-rules/">rules on how to play</a>).</p>
<p>That all changes with MLBPool2. Like NFLPool, the app is written in Python (3.6) and <a href="https://trypyramid.com">Pyramid</a>. I debated about starting from scratch or just modifying NFLPool and opted for the latter. I’ve been hip deep in development for the last two months and the finish line is almost in sight. I should have been writing about the development more, but that takes away from my coding time. (Shame on me!)</p>
<p>The major difference from NFLPool is that players have the ability to change up to 14 of their picks at baseball’s All-Star Break. This was much more complex than I thought it would be and I realized if I was going to do it, I might as well add more and more functionality to make it easier for the player. This included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players can change their picks before the season starts without penalty</li>
<li>When changing a pick, the drop down menu defaults to the original pick a player made</li>
<li>I added a column when changing a pick that shows if the original pick was unique or not</li>
</ul>
<p>The hardest part was all of the <code>datetime</code> calculations around changing picks. If the season hadn’t started, let the user change their picks; if the season has started, redirect the user that it’s too late to change a pick; if it’s during the All-Star Break, let them change their pick and then have the system make that pick worth half the points; and if it’s after the All-Star Break, redirect them again that it’s too late to change anything.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, I have a hard time working with Python’s <code>datetime</code> module. I had planned to use Kenneth Reitz’s <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/maya">Maya – Datetime for Humans,</a> but unfortunately the documentation is offline. I ended up going with the <a href="https://pendulum.eustace.io/">Pendulum</a> module, which has been fantastic to work with and has <em>excellent</em> documentation. (It’s so good I emailed the developer a couple weeks ago with a thank you note). I even created a service just to deal with the date and time manipulations, rather than have Pendulum instances throughout the code. A great side benefit is that it makes testing so much easier.</p>
<pre><code>class TimeService:
    @staticmethod
    def get_time():
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Create a service to get the time - there were too many instances of getting the current time in
        the codebase making testing difficult.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        # Change now_time for testing
        # Use this one for production:
        # now_time = pendulum.now(tz=pendulum.timezone('America/New_York')).to_datetime_string()
        # Use this one for testing:
        now_time = pendulum.create(2017, 3, 17, 18, 59, tz='America/New_York')

        return now_time
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see in the code above, I can just create one instance for testing and change the date to before the season starts, the All-Star Break or after the break. This also fixes an issue I had with NFLPool where I did not do the <code>datetime</code> manipulation correctly because of timezone differences with my web server and a user was locked out of submitting picks before the deadline. This worked out so well I even added an alert to the page where you submit picks showing how much time is left until picks are due:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There are two major pieces of functionality that need to be finished. There are two complex SQL queries. One to update the unique picks and one to calculate the scoring. I couldn’t figure out how to do this in SQLAlchemy and my wife Kelly wrote direct SQL statements in the code. I was able to re-write the first one to calculate unique picks after the season started but haven’t figured out how to update it for after the All-Star Break. I don’t have the patience to learn SQL right now, so she is going to help me with those when she’s on spring break from the University of Minnesota next week. From there, it will be time for deployment – and just in time, as players will have about ten days from deployment to when picks are due and the Major League Baseball season starts.</p>
<p><a href="https://trypyramid.com">Pyramid</a> is just a joy to work with and I’m so thankful for the <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business">Talk Python course</a> that taught me to use it. (I wish Pyramid had 20% of mindshare that Flask does. Maybe it does where it matters, but there is just so much on the web about Flask that it feels like it doesn’t).</p>
<p>The best part about writing MLBPool2 though is my confidence level in coding in Python has increased greatly. I’m doing things in MLBPool2 that I didn’t do in NFLPool – from manipulating datetimes, string manipulation, a lot more if / else statements, Slack integration, and more advanced Chameleon templates. I’m sure there are lot of areas that are still not Pythonic enough, but I feel more confident and I know the learning won’t stop. I’ll try and write some more blog posts about what I’ve learned and how MLBPool2 differs from NFLPool (and what I want to add back into NFLPool.)</p>

            <description>The NFLPool 2017 season wrapped up a month ago. The application performed admirably. Every week I logged in, downloaded the weekly statistics from MySportsFeeds, and the scoring calculations updated and posted on the standings page. I emailed the players every other week with the update and link to the standings (and the reminder that the team standings points would not be final until the end of the season due to MySportsFeeds shows division standings doesn’t account for the correct tiebreakers).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The NFLPool 2017 season wrapped up a month ago. The application performed admirably. Every week I logged in, downloaded the weekly statistics from <a href="https://mysportsfeeds.com">MySportsFeeds</a>, and the scoring calculations updated and posted on the standings page. I emailed the players every other week with the update and link to the <a href="https://nflpool.xyz/standings">standings</a> (and the reminder that the team standings points would not be final until the end of the season due to MySportsFeeds shows division standings doesn’t account for the correct tiebreakers). Everything looked good and it was working as expected.</p>
<p>Or so we thought.</p>
<p>After week 17 was complete, I ran the update again and sent out the preliminary results. I worked with Brad at MySportsFeeds to update the division standings feed to rank the teams correctly according to the NFL’s tiebreakers. Then, one player caught that some of his individual leaders weren’t assigning points correctly. Digging in, I saw that in my picks, some of my players weren’t having their points assigned either.</p>
<p>I was so focused on the team standings and not individual player standings that there was a bug in the code. Week 1 worked correctly, but weeks 2-17 did not calculate the individual player performance correctly – and none of us caught it! Kelly was able to <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/nflpool/commit/9c6070569b3ebfaeb362cd6085b6e6029a8b0b45">fix the SQL query</a> she wrote and voila, everything worked! The only catch was that a week had gone by and the way that I programmed the <a href="https://www.nflpool.xyz/standings">standings page</a> to display the title it now says “Week 18” instead of “Week 17”.</p>
<p>I’m pretty proud of myself for creating my first Python application (even if I didn’t write the SQL queries that do the scoring calculations). Everything worked great and I’ve learned so much about Python (and still have so much to learn). I have a list of things to improve and enhance for the 2018 season. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update / fix the <code>datetime</code> function when a user submits their picks. One player got locked out too soon.</li>
<li>The traversal to the standings is <code>www.nflpool.xyz/standings</code> – this shows the current standings. This needs to add a year, to both allow players to see a previous season’s history – such as <code>www.nflpool.xyz/standings/2017</code> – I’ll probably need to add a template page for standings then to list out all the available years as well as figure out what I want to do in the navigation.</li>
<li>Write a function that if the week is 17, call it final on the template page’s header.</li>
<li>Figure out how curl can call the get request to update the stats – it has to use my login to access the admin panel’s URL to call the get request and I don’t know how to do that in curl.</li>
<li>Lots of other enhancement plans, such as porting the app from SQLite to MySQL, but the above list are the big ones. I’m trying to make sure I capture any <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/nflpool/issues">bugs or enhancements on Github</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking of MySQL, NFLPool was always intended to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Automate our NFLPool league</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve as a testbed for MLBPool2</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m happy to say that <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/mlbpool2">MLBPool2 is now under active development</a>. I have exactly 8 weeks from today before the Major League Baseball season kicks off, so I have about 6 weeks to get it working. And I’ve already been able to get it to work with MySQL! But MLBPoo2 development is a different blog post for later this week.</p>

            <description>NFLPool has been up for six weeks and everything is working great. I’ve been updating the standings every Tuesday without any issues. I’ve taken the last month to catch my breath after my massive coding spree to get it launched and I’ve been thinking about what’s next. I have a few options:
 Add some tests (all Python projects should have tests written, right?) Adding documentation in reStructured Text to NFLPool Re-visit some of the Python trainings now that I have a basic grasp of Python and learn some more “advanced” concepts (generators, list comprehensions, etc.</description>

<p>The choice became an easy one as a couple of weeks ago I was asked by <a href="http://pythontesting.net">Brian Okken</a> if I would like to review a copy of his new book, <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/bopytest/python-testing-with-pytest">Python Testing with pytest</a>.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I shared with Brian that I’m coming at this from the perspective of someone new to Python – I’ll be digging into the book this weekend and I’ll be blogging my progress on adding tests to my project with what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>Thanks Brian for the review copy and I’m excited to learn about testing in Python!</p>

            <title>NFLPool: a (kind of) Post Mortem</title>

            <description>I’m now four weeks into NFLPool being live. The week leading up to and after the launch of NFLPool for NFL week 1 was kind of a blur. I wish I had taken better notes or wrote down everything that happened, but now being a month into it, here are some random thoughts.
Submitting Picks Somewhere in my code, I screwed up the function to disallow making picks. The code should have refused to let a user make picks after 7pm CST on the Thursday kickoff of the first game, about twenty minutes before the game starts.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m now four weeks into NFLPool being live. The week leading up to and after the launch of NFLPool for NFL week 1 was kind of a blur. I wish I had taken better notes or wrote down everything that happened, but now being a month into it, here are some random thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-picks">Submitting Picks</h2>
<p>Somewhere in my code, I screwed up the function to disallow making picks. The code should have refused to let a user make picks after 7pm CST on the Thursday kickoff of the first game, about twenty minutes before the game starts. Of course, that morning I headed up north for my annual guy weekend and didn’t have a computer. I got a few panicked text messages that one user couldn’t make his picks. I was able to manually take care of it when I came back the following Monday, but I have to track it down and fix it. It’s hard coded and I thought I did a midnight stop to account for the fact my server is on UTC time, but it obviously didn’t work. Listening to a Talk Python podcast just last week with the famous Kenneth Reitz, I might have to look into his Maya package (time zones for humans).</p>
<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>
<p>I added a Twitter field to the user registration page and made it optional. I have an idea for the future that I might add Tweepy support that would DM a player every week after the points have been updated with their score and rank. It turns out that if you make the field unique in SQLite that leaving the field blank only allows one person to <em>not</em> fill in the Twitter field. Who knew? I had to remove the unique requirement.</p>
<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
<p>Kelly continued to work on the scoring calculations while I was gone that weekend. She had it working when I came back, but using the 2016 data there was a difference in what NFLPool was showing and what I had done by hand last year. Sure enough, the program was right. I had mistakenly given the person who won twenty extra points that he didn’t earn and he should have come in second place. The kicker? The person who was in second place and should have won NFLPool in 2016 was me. The good news is that since it was me and my mistake, I wasn’t out the $300 delta I should have won in the pool. But it sure would have been nice to have pocketed the extra $300…</p>
<h2 id="misc">Misc.</h2>
<p>There were some other gotchas at launch. I had PHP working on Nginx before installing NFLPool, but however I did it using FastCGI was getting in the way of Pyramid serving NFLPool. Disabling FastCGI fixed Pyramid. I also created a systemd service to manage NFLPool. Of course SELinux doesn’t like it and I have to run it as sudo. I still need to fix that at some point.</p>
<p>There’s a couple little things I want to work on as well, but I’ve taken the last few weeks to recover. The big thing I need to address is updating the stats every week. Right now, it’s a manual process. I’ve got administrative access built in, so I visit the admin panel and hit a button to update the stats. I need to figure out how I can do this via a cron job by calling a POST request, but I have no idea how I can use curl to automate this as it requires being logged in. I have some ideas on how to do this, but it’s going to require some research and planning and when I do implement it, I’ll write it up.</p>
<p>Lastly, with NFLPool successfully launched and running for a few weeks, I submitted it to the <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/showcase">Talk Python Student Showcase</a>. I just can’t speak highly enough of the <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business">Python for Entrepreneurs</a> training that Michael Kennedy created. I would have ended up creating scripts to calculate the points – not a full featured website. If you’re looking to learn Python, look no further then all of the courses available on Talk Python.</p>
<p>NFLPool might be in maintenance and enhancement mode now that it’s launched, but this isn’t the end of my Python journey. I can’t and won’t claim that I know Python. I’ve only scratched the surface and I still find myself following tutorials to get stuff done. I have a number of things I still want to add to NFLPool, and I’m sure as we play additional seasons even more ideas will come to me. Plus, I need to do it all over again for MLBPool2….</p>

            <description>I mentioned in my last post (and a couple others) how invaluable my wife has been in my journey to learn Python. That was turned up to 11 last week and I (we) started working on the scoring calculations.
I started to write the scoring calculations exactly as you would expect a newbie coder to – step by step. With the changes to the data model Kelly recommended, I still have a hard time wrapping my head around how we’ve abstracted the pick information.</description>

<p>I started to write the scoring calculations exactly as you would expect a newbie coder to – step by step. With the changes to the data model Kelly recommended, I still have a hard time wrapping my head around how we’ve abstracted the pick information. For scoring, the first goal is find the top three players in their position. I made a SQL query using SQLAlchemy which returned with the NFL Player’s <code>player_id</code> and the needed stats – in this case interceptions, which I knew had resulted in a tie that I would have to account for. This returned a tuple: <code>(123456, 1)</code>. I then used a list comprehension (yay, me!) to turn that into a list and quickly realized I had to reverse the tuple to sort it by interception and not player ID. Thanks to Stack Overflow, I even found a function that added rank to the list that even accounted for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking#Strategies_for_assigning_rankings">standard competition ranking</a>.</p>
<p>My wife looked at that, shook her head, and told me there had to be a better way and it could all be done in SQL. That started a process that lasted a few hours to figure out how to do SQL directly in the app instead of using SQLAlchemy. After she spent hours coding all the SQL queries, I now have a hundreds of line of code that I can read, but don’t really understand. But it works! As she doesn’t really know Python, I have some clean up to do to conform to PEP8, but I’m not complaining at all.</p>
<p>The other thing I did a terrible job with was naming my database columns – they weren’t consistent. I fixed all those over the weekend, but I also had to change them all in production. Changing the database in production scares the hell out of me, especially as a handful of players have already created their accounts, but thankfully haven’t submitted their picks yet. The first round of changes to the production database went fine and Sunday night I made the second round of changes to accommodate the player picks table so we could correctly do scoring.</p>
<p>And of course things broke. I had just arrived in the office when <a href="https://www.rollbar.com">Rollbar </a>notified me in Slack and via email that the production website had errors. I am so grateful that Michael Kennedy included adding Rollbar support in the Python for Entrepreneurs course. Within ten minutes I had fixed both the fact that the submit picks page requires you to be logged in (instead of displaying an error) – not sure how I forgot to add it to that page – and second I fixed the database table that needed an update to correctly let a player submit their picks. I need to improve my QA skills.</p>
<p>I need to finish the QA testing on the scoring calculations by simulating the 2016 season, but it’s looking good so far. We’re 36 hours from picks locking and the season kicking off and I’m excited.</p>

            <description>NFLPool has been live for almost two weeks – and hasn’t crashed (yet!) After the rush to get the site up and allow a user to make their picks before I left on vacation, there is one more large chunk of work to get to 1.0 release: calculate the score for all players every week of the NFL season.
I spent all of last week in the middle of Minnesota at a friend’s cabin.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NFLPool has been live for almost two weeks – and hasn’t crashed (yet!) After the rush to get the site up and allow a user to make their picks before I left on vacation, there is one more large chunk of work to get to 1.0 release: calculate the score for all players every week of the NFL season.</p>
<p>I spent all of last week in the middle of Minnesota at a friend’s cabin. It was great to get away from both my day job and NFLPool, but I was loathe to ruin my daily coding streak on Github:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I did bring my laptop to the cabin, and the first couple of mornings I did some minor work, mostly starting the process to add docstrings to the code to document the different methods. Being a former documentation contributor to <a href="https://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> you would think that I would include documentation in both the code and the project, but no. I now understand why some developers don’t include documentation in the rush of getting something built. If you look closely, you’ll see in the second last column on the right of the screenshot I did stop coding for a few days and enjoyed my vacation.</p>
<p>Kelly’s help was invaluable (again) in creating the data model to store the picks. There are three tables used. In my last post, I had mentioned that Kelly had me re-do the way we store a player’s picks. To do this, we created a “pick type” table. This is a reference table for the different kids of picks the players make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual Player Stats (passing leader, rushing leader, etc.)</li>
<li>Team Stats (Division winners, 2nd place, last place)</li>
<li>Wildcard playoff teams</li>
<li>Tiebreaker</li>
</ul>
<p><code>&lt;br /&gt; class PickTypes(SqlAlchemyBase):&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;tablename&lt;/strong&gt; = 'PickTypes'&lt;br /&gt; pick_id = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)&lt;br /&gt; name = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.String)&lt;br /&gt;</code></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>When a player makes their picks, it’s stored in the PlayerPicks database table:</p>
<p><code>&lt;br /&gt; class PlayerPicks(SqlAlchemyBase):&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;tablename&lt;/strong&gt; = 'PlayerPicks'&lt;br /&gt; pick_id = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)&lt;br /&gt; user_id = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.String, sqlalchemy.ForeignKey('Account.id'))&lt;br /&gt; season = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, index=True)&lt;br /&gt; date_submitted = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.DATETIME)&lt;br /&gt; conf_id = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, sqlalchemy.ForeignKey('ConferenceInfo.conf_id'))&lt;br /&gt; division_id = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, sqlalchemy.ForeignKey('DivisionInfo.division_id'))&lt;br /&gt; rank = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer)&lt;br /&gt; team_id = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, sqlalchemy.ForeignKey('TeamInfo.team_id'))&lt;br /&gt; multiplier = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, default=1)&lt;br /&gt; player_id = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, sqlalchemy.ForeignKey('ActiveNFLPlayers.player_id'))&lt;br /&gt; pick_type = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, sqlalchemy.ForeignKey('PickTypes.pick_id'))&lt;br /&gt;</code></p>
<p>There are 41 total picks a player makes stored as 41 rows in the database:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The next part I just couldn’t wrap my head around. Kelly recommended I make a table with just four columns:</p>
<p><code>&lt;br /&gt; class WeeklyPlayerResults(SqlAlchemyBase):&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;tablename&lt;/strong&gt; = 'WeeklyPlayerResults'&lt;br /&gt; pick_id = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True, index=True)&lt;br /&gt; season = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer)&lt;br /&gt; week = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer)&lt;br /&gt; points_earned = sqlalchemy.Column(sqlalchemy.Integer)&lt;br /&gt;</code></p>
<p>It took me a few minutes, but <code>pick_id</code> in this table contains (embeds?) the <code>user_id```</code>, <code>pick_type</code>, <code>season</code>, and the pick data. It made my head hurt.</p>
<p>The other thing she pointed out to me is I did a poor job implementing the data model with some inconsistent column names across tables. For example, the <code>Account</code> table uses <code>id</code> as the column name to store a user’s unique id – this should have been <code>user_id</code>. In other tables I use a generic <code>id</code> to store a primary key. I spent some time yesterday fixing almost all of these, with the exception of Accounts. The <code>id</code> used in Accounts has too many references in the code already, but where I could I changed <code>id</code> to <code>primary_key</code> and some other changes to make the column names more explicit. I then had to update the database in production, which always makes me extremely nervous. But if I’m going to do it, now is the time when I only have a handful of users and can touch all of the tables outside of <code>Account</code> in production.</p>
<p>But anyway, it was time to start working on the ability import statistics every week of the NFL season from <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com">MySportsFeeds</a>. Here is where things get ugly. Calculating a player’s score weekly for 17 weeks over the course of the season is going to take a lot of testing. My goal is to use the data from last year’s players in 2016 to compare the app’s scoring mechanism to what I did by hand. If I do it right, they should match (unless I made mistakes last year). But MySportsFeeds changed the API from version 1.0 in 2016 to 1.1 in 2017 and the URL to pull the stats differs. I had hoped to start a new branch called 2016 in git to do testing, but I then lost a day when I screwed up my branches trying to merge between master, 2016 and pyramid (where I do all of the development work before merging to master, which I treat as production). So I’m doing it all in my development branch, pyramid, which results in a big if / else statement:</p>
<p>`<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
if season == 2016:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
response = requests.get(&lsquo;<a href="https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v1.1/pull/nfl/2016-2017-'">https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v1.1/pull/nfl/2016-2017-'</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lsquo;regular/cumulative_player_stats.json?position=QB&amp;playerstats=Yds&rsquo;,<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
auth=HTTPBasicAuth(secret.msf_username, secret.msf_pw))<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
else:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
response = requests.get(&lsquo;<a href="https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v1.1/pull/nfl/'">https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v1.1/pull/nfl/'</a> + str(season) +<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lsquo;-regular/cumulative_player_stats.json?position=QB&amp;playerstats=Yds&rsquo;,<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
auth=HTTPBasicAuth(secret.msf_username, secret.msf_pw))<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After the season is over, I’ll probably remove all 2016 references like this, but for now, I need them.</p>
<p>I had hoped to make one API call to MySportsFeeds in <code>weekly_msf_data.py</code> for all five of the individual NFL player stats (rushing, passing, etc) but to save a little database space, I wrote five methods for each category. That was easy enough: it pulled the right data and saved it to the database.</p>
<p>But doing the team stats (division winners, points for leaders by conference, etc.) was not nearly as easy. The <code>division_team_standings.json</code> from MySportsFeeds is a dictionary containing two lists. The first list is for NFL conference (AFC and NFC) and each conference has a list inside it for the four divisions. There has to be a more Pythonic way of iterating over this than what I did. (Maybe using a generator?) But I just don’t have the Python knowledge yet. I have it working, but I do this four times, once for each division:</p>
<p>`<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
while x &lt; len(team_data):<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
rank = (team_data[x]<a href="https://www.gnome.org">&ldquo;teamentry&rdquo;</a>[&ldquo;rank&rdquo;])<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
team_id = (team_data[x]<a href="https://www.gnome.org">&ldquo;teamentry&rdquo;</a>[&ldquo;team&rdquo;][&ldquo;ID&rdquo;])<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Using <!-- raw HTML omitted --><code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>, and <code>a</code>this returns 8 results four times, which includes both conferences. Ugly, but it works.</p>
<p>But when I added this to the <code>WeeklyTeamStats</code> table, I was creating 96 rows – the 32 NFL teams three times. I only wanted 32 rows – and it took me three hours of reading through the SQLAlchemy documentation and examples on StackOverflow to figure out how to do an update to the table instead of an insert. That’s one way to learn.</p>
<p>Now that I can store NFL data, next steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add picks for the 8 players from the 2016 season to test results</li>
<li>Then add a method to iterate through those picks and figure out which picks a player made are unique and assign it a multiplier of two (for the unique bonus)</li>
<li>Lastly, and most importantly, then calculate each player’s score based on the real results. And figure out how to display them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have two weeks before the first week of the 2017 NFL season when NFLPool players will want to see their results. No problem. I think.</p>

            <description>It’s been a long journey, but the first release of NFLPool is now live at NFLPool.xyz.
We’ll call it a 0.5 release. Features include:
 New installation service:  Upon starting the Pyramid app for the first time, the database and all of its tables are created. I’ve built an admin panel where the administrator log into and kicks off the installation service:  Downloads all of the team information from MySportsFeeds including NFL team names, conference, and division information and inserts it into the database.</description>

<li>I’ve built an admin panel where the administrator log into and kicks off the installation service:
<ul>
<li>Downloads all of the team information from MySportsFeeds including NFL team names, conference, and division information and inserts it into the database.</li>
<li>The admin is then directed to the next page to enter the season year. This page is also used each year to start a new season. The NFL schedule is then downloaded from MySportsFeeds and entered into the database.</li>
<li>Lastly the admin then downloads all of the active players in the NFL and this is inserted into the database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NFLPool
<ul>
<li>Users can register and create an account. Thanks to Python’s <code>passlib</code> module, the user password is hashed and salted over 150,000 times to keep it secure. A lot of the functionality of the site requires you to be logged in.</li>
<li>Once a user is logged in, they can make their picks for the new season.
<ul>
<li>I’ve hardcoded the time allowed to make your picks. Picks need to be submitted by 6:59 p.m. the date of the first game (Thursday night kickoff before Labor Day.)</li>
<li>The picks are displayed to the user for a drop down box for each pick. Lots of coding to make this happen to query the database and then only display the right information. For example, when making the AFC East Division winner picks, only the Bills, Dolphins, Jets and Patriots are available in the drop down box. I’m not going to pretend I’m even close to understanding Chameleon templates, but it’s pretty cool how you can iterate over a list and display it dynamically in the template page.</li>
<li>After a user makes their picks, they can view them from their account page. It took a lot of coding and help from my wife to make the SQL query in SQLAlchemy – the SQL query itself is four left joins in SQL (four <code>OUTERJOIN</code>) in SQLAlchemy. The <code>#sqlalchemy</code> IRC channel on Freenode was helpful in getting to done on the query. Using Chameleon templates, it’s pretty cool that I can dynamically create the pages for each season for the user to view their picks. Personally, I think it will be cool after we have two or three years of data. Unfortunately, I haven’t figured out a way to iterate over the object that’s created yet to display it correctly. It’s #1 on the to-do list to get fixed. Most users won’t be submitting their picks until the day or two before kickoff in three weeks, so I’m telling myself I have a little time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the hard work begins. I’m only calling it a 0.5 release because I still have to write all the code to import all of the player and team stats each week of the season from MySportsFeeds and then write the code to calculate each player’s score. Once that is done, we’ll call it 1.0.</p>
<p>One of the fun (or frustrating things) as I’ve come close launching is all of the stuff I keep thinking of that I could add. For example, after sending out the email yesterday to last year’s players that the new site was up and the new process, I realized I should build an admin panel page to view all accounts created on the site. I was pretty darn happy that I could knock that out in ten or fifteen minutes – I feel that I’ve got a handle on Pyramid’s viewmodels and services. I wrote the query and the template page and voila. The hardest part was where to put the <code>tal:repeat</code> call in the Chameleon template and table to make it pretty! (Which I got right on the second try.) I have a whole list of to-do items grouped by the Admin Panel, the app, creating the standings calculations and a future wish list that I don’t even want to think about. That doesn’t even get into the fact that a lot of my code is definitely not Pythonic – I’m guessing I could be using list comprehensions and a number of things to make the code better. I still have a lot to learn, but it’s working.</p>
<p>Lastly, I won’t even go into deployment. It was difficult at best. Lots of challenges with getting the nginx web server to work and I still don’t think I have the systemd service working exactly right. I’m very grateful for the help in the Pyramid IRC channel on Freenode – the Pyramid developers were super helpful in troubleshooting nginx. But I do have the whole site running SSL and redirects working to make it secure, so I have that going for me.</p>

            <description>We’re a day away from launch. The NFL season starts in just over three weeks and players will need to submit their picks for NFLPool for the 2017 season. The majority of the picks won’t come until days before the season kickoff, but it would be nice to iron out some bugs… like the last one that might prevent me from launching for a few more days (but more on that later).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re a day away from launch. The NFL season starts in just over three weeks and players will need to submit their picks for NFLPool for the 2017 season. The majority of the picks won’t come until days before the season kickoff, but it would be nice to iron out some bugs… like the last one that might prevent me from launching for a few more days (but more on that later).</p>
<p>The last few days have been filled with big and little things. I had three big things to finish at the end of last week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the email service working (welcome email and password resets)</li>
<li>Fix password resets (which I broke)</li>
<li>Add logging</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting the email service working was harder than expected. To use a third party email service, like Amazon’s Simple Email Service, you have to update your website’s DNS records. My first problem was Amazon couldn’t create my account. After getting that resolved, I couldn’t get it to recognize my DNS changes no matter what I tried. I ended up going with <a href="https://www.mailjet.com/">Mailjet</a>, which is working great. Just a bit more expensive, but it works.</p>
<p>Next was a day lost to password resets, and when I asked Kelly for help, needing a second set of eyes, it turns out the change I made to Pyramid’s routing broke it. I should have never, ever changed it. This was another case of me thinking I’m clever than I really am.</p>
<p>The good news with the routing, is that I think I might be starting to understand it, which is going to help with showing picks and standings once NFLPool has more than one season under its belt. More on that in a bit.</p>
<p>Lastly, I added logging. I followed the Python for Entrepreneurs class exactly, and now I’m using the <code>logbook</code> module successfully and am a happy <a href="https://www.rollbar.com">Rollbar</a> customer. (Thanks again, Talk Python!) Of course this means every time I break something while in development, I get an email from Rollbar that I have an error in my site, but it will be worth it.</p>
<p>I also finished a few smaller things, including importing the NFL schedule from MySportsFeeds and adding it to the installation process. This allowed me to write a check that if the first game has started to redirect the user to a page telling them it’s too late to submit picks. (Sorry, not sorry).</p>
<p>Once those things were complete, I moved on to the last big piece of functionality I needed to complete: showing the player the picks they just submitted. And things completely spiraled out of control after that.</p>
<p>Months ago Kelly sketched out what my data model should look like for storing a user’s picks.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I didn’t understand it then and it was the major reason development stalled this past spring. I thought I knew better and coded it the way that made sense to me. And of course, she was right. So this weekend was all about starting over. She helped me understand what I needed to do, and I had to add a number of new tables to the database and re-write dozens of methods to create the pics submission form and process it to store in the database. (But the good news is that if and when I convert NFLPool to MLBPool2, this fixes a major issue with MLBPool2 as users can change their picks at the All Star Break. I can now capture those changes <strong>and</strong> assign the points half value per the rules).</p>
<p>Then it was on to trying to show the user their picks. And that’s where we are – it’s hopelessly broken. I did figure out two cool things in Pyramid, which is auto-creating the pages for picks based on the season (this is related to routes from above) and after another quick query fix from Kelly, that works great. She was able to write a SQL query in SQL that does correctly pull all of a user’s picks, but I can’t seem to convert that a SQLAlchemy query that actually works. I’ve asked for help on Reddit and next up will be on StackOverflow. It’s all about the <code>_and</code> operator in SQLAlchemy which is way beyond my rudimentary understanding of Python and SQLAlchemy.</p>
<p>The last challenge is that every time I start working on something, whether it’s the admin installation process, user picks, or the user account page, I think of something cool that I want to add before I launch. I keep having to stop myself and instead I’ve started adding them to a to-do list in Wunderlist. Tom Clancy once wrote: <em>If you don’t write it down, it never happened</em> as Jack Ryan’s wife told him and it’s something that has always stuck with me. At some point I’ll convert them to Github issues and label them as bugs or feature enhancements and add them to milestones, but for now there is just too much to do.</p>
<p>And this is just to get the site launched and be able to have users register and submit their picks. I haven’t even started on the ability to compute a user’s score…. So much to do, so little time.</p>
<p>But I did change the homepage of <a href="https://nflpool.xyz">NFLPool</a> to reflect I’m launching tomorrow. It’s time.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m not even sure where to start from last update on Friday. The last 48 hours have been a roller coaster of up and downs of getting stuck and then figuring it out.</p>
<p>After completing the the functionality to create a new installation and add a new season to NFLPoo (or update to a new season) l, I needed to start working on letting a user make their picks for the new season.</p>
<p>First, I had to revisit my data model on where I store all the team information about each NFL team, including the division and conference each team lives in. During the new install process, I’ve added some code that now automatically assigns this. For the most part, this information is static. The NFL hasn’t changed what teams are in each division since the 90s and the only thing that may change at some point is if a team relocates and their abbreviation changes. For example, with the Chargers moving from San Diego to Los Angeles, they went from SDC to LAC. The Raiders are still a few years away from moving to Las Vegas, so I’m just going to leave that hard coded as is.</p>
<p>Now it was time to start coding the form that shows to users to make their picks. I couldn’t decide if this should live within its own controller or in the account controller. In the end, I’ve moved all of the picks to its own controller. But to do so, I need to re-watch all of the training videos on the routes, controllers and services to make this happen in Pyramid. It just wasn’t clicking for me. I was stuck Sunday, had a breakthrough, and by Monday night I was stuck again with a similar, but different, issue. I just couldn’t wrap my head around why and how you have to pass a dictionary from the controller and how it interacts with the data layer in the service. But finally, it clicked.</p>
<p>I finished wiring that up and now I needed to dig deep into Chameleon templates and Bootstrap forms with the Bootstrap CSS. Talk about getting stuck and being frustrated. The example used in the Python for Entrepreneurs course is pretty basic and I needed to pass a lot of values from the controller – one for each pick. I don’t know if there is a better way to do it, but I’ve figured it out by calling the service and a given method for each of the queries. For example, you have to pick which teams will finish 1st, 2nd or Last in a division (four teams in a division). This is one method per division. The method looks at the database and does a <code>SELECT</code> on the <code>TeamInfo</code> table <code>WHERE</code> the conference is equal to AFC and the division is equal to East and return the four teams in that conference and division. I got that working and was able to return two of the divisions. I didn’t want to do them all as I just needed to prototype that I could have two queries working and stick them in the form.</p>
<p>After I got that working, I needed to learn and understand how I could pass those attributes (the team name) inside of a dropdown box. Let me tell you – Google results for Chameleon templates, even when adding some of the TAL markup, are few and far between. You sure do see a lot of Powerpoint templates featuring chameleons in the search results for some reason.</p>
<p>There was so much swearing involved. I could iterate over the list, but then it would display four objects and not the team name. I kept at it, realizing I needed to fix the query, and now the team name did display. This was just inside a paragraph tag. I needed this to display inside a dropdown box and instead I made four dropdown boxes appear. (Progress? At least I was still iterating over the list.) And then I was stuck and asked my wife for help. She’s never used Python or Chameleon templates, but after about ten or fifteen minutes, she figured out the issue. To make matters worse, I was using the wrong Bootstrap button group, so we fixed that and she also figured out in Chameleon how to make the <code>team_id</code> display as the <code>team_name</code> and pass the <code>team_id</code> back to the form when submitting. I’m not going to even pretend I understand Chameleon templates and using more than these values – I understand you can do all kinds of Python code right in the template, but I don’t need it right now and it makes my head hurt.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That was huge. I then spent the last couple of hours before bed trying to figure out how to capture the <code>user_id</code> of the person currently logged in and making their picks, so I could submit that to the database so I know who actually made the picks. Lots of review of the <code>BaseController</code> from the training and I got it.</p>
<p>By that time it was past my bedtime, but I had the pick submission process working. I could grab the <code>user_id</code> of the person submitting the picks, the date and time the picks were submitted, and the picks themselves all grabbed from the form and passed to the database. The form also needs a lot of styling, but I’ll take usability first.</p>
<p>I’m so close to launching I can taste it – and with no time to spare. This week I need to finish coding the picks form and get all the choices in there, and then I need to add the password reset functionality to Accounts and add logging from Rollbar. It would be nice to log when a pick is submitted and get a notification, as well as any errors. Then it comes time to deployment, of which I have many thoughts, but that’s for another post.</p>

            <description>I came across a thread on /r/LearnPython a few weeks ago that summed up my experience with Python. The thread was the typical “I’m learning Python, but I feel stuck and I’m not learning”. Someone replied with encouragement, and pointed out that studying Python is very different than learning Python and how it works.
I can relate. It’s been just over a year since I started down this path and almost two years (where does the time go!</description>

The thread was the typical “I’m learning Python, but I feel stuck and I’m not learning”. Someone replied with encouragement, and pointed out that studying Python is very different than learning Python and how it works.</p>
<p>I can relate. It’s been just over a year since I started down this path and almost two years (where does the time go!) since I decided I wanted to learn Python.</p>
<p>I started by buying a couple of books. That didn’t work for me at all – I don’t learn from reading and trying to apply the exercises. The Python for Everybody specialization at Coursera that I took last summer, with the video lectures and online exercises was the first time I felt I was actually learning. But in actuality, I was still studying. The same with the Python Jumpstart course. Having gone through Python for Entrepreneurs, and finally starting to apply what I’ve studied, I feel that I’m now learning.</p>
<p>Even though a large chunk of what I’m building in the NFLPool web app using Pyramid is copying and pasting from Python for Entrepreneurs, I’m starting to feel confident that the concepts are sticking.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, I had a couple of the bigger components working. Users can visit the website and register, and the site recognizes when they’re logged in and out. I also created an admin panel that creates a new install and imports the NFL team information into one of the database table. This information is static and never needs to be updated. It uses a GET / POST / REDIRECT pattern and then redirects to the next page to insert all of the active NFL players for the new season.</p>
<p>Yesterday I sat down and needed to change this. Mr. Kennedy is always talking about the GET / POST / REDIRECT pattern , and though I thought I understood it, when I built the first one above, it took me a bit to get the redirect working. But I needed to change it so the next redirect would create a form to update the database for a new season and then redirect to import the active players.</p>
<p>I sat down and wrote the template and HTML code for the page, then wrote the controller for the GET / POST / REDIRECT routes, and then the service to interact with the database. I did this for the first time without referencing the training materials! The sense of accomplishment was huge. Not only was I writing code for the Pyramid web framework correctly, I was using requests and JSON to get the data MySportsFeed, manipulate it, and then put it in the database.</p>
<p>Of course, later yesterday, I wanted to write it so when you updated to a new season, it took a variable from a form rather than be hardcoded, and was stuck for two hours when it work. But it turned out it wasn’t the Python code – after my wife helped me for an hour, we realized it was the HTML form that had the error. So that was big, too – the Python code was right! It was just my lack of knowledge around HTML causing the latest headache.</p>
<p>Now I have two big things for the weekend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Re-write all of the requests so they’re not hardcoded and pass the season attribute from the database to the request so every year I don’t have to update the code.</li>
<li>Right the controller and service for players to make their picks. This one is going to be tough – I’ll need to grab the user ID from their logged in session (which I’m not 100% sure how to do yet) and then grab a lot of stuff from the database and put it into a dropdown box for selection – which I also have no idea how to do. I feel ok that I know how to do the query, but putting the query results into a dropdown box is scary.</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way, for the first time, I’m applying what I’ve studied – and I finally feel that after over a year I’m actually <em>learning</em> Python.</p>

            <description>I took the week off from work to see how much progress I could make on NFLPool this week (and to get some stuff done around the house, but really, for NFLPool). I told myself I’d blog my progress every day and here it is Wednesday already.
In my last blog post, I noted how I was going to have to move back to SQLite for the database. Over the weekend I ripped out most of the MongoDB code and started laying the groundwork for SQLite.</description>

<p>In my last blog post, I noted how I was going to have to move back to SQLite for the database. Over the weekend I ripped out most of the MongoDB code and started laying the groundwork for SQLite. The first thing I did Monday morning was going back through the SQLAlchemy chapter of Python for Entrepreneurs to learn how to properly set up classes in Pyramid using SQLAlchemy to create all the database tables. Back when I was building the first prototype for NFLPool, I had written a Python program that set up used the sqlite module and created all of the tables and then populated the database with the NFL teams information (Team ID, name of the team, city, etc.) and also populated the Active Players table with a list of all players in the NFL. This was all done using the SQL language – which I do not enjoy at all.</p>
<p>I won’t pretend that I still understand object oriented programming, especially the use of classes in Python. I’ve come a long way and I understand the concept of how a class creates an instance of the object, but putting it into practice is still a challenge. Using the Python for Entrepreneurs course examples, I was able to take my data model, write the SQLAlchemy classes, and get the database created.</p>
<p><a href="https://paulcutler.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot-2017-07-31-08.42.02-3.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>One of the nice things about the course is that it does touch on how to create an index in a table and making foreign keys to join two tables together, which I’ll need. If I don’t ever migrate to MongoDB, I may want to just use MySQL, which technically, I believe, doesn’t support foreign keys. So I’m not sure how portable this code will be, but like everything else I’m doing, Future Paul can deal with that.</p>
<p>Monday afternoon was all about re-learning the Pyramid concepts of routes, abstracting the database in the viewmodel, and then writing the code in the controller. That took longer than I thought it would. The concepts are originally taught very early in the course, but then you go a long time without touching that part of the code. After all of the hands-on work, I think I’ve got a handle on it. I do like how Mr. Kennedy has you separate the viewmodel from the controller – he makes a point in the training you don’t have to do it – but if you don’t, I don’t see how troubleshooting your code could be easy.</p>
<p>That night, I took the kids to the community center where they swim while I sit and watch them in the viewing area with my laptop and use the free WiFi. I pulled my code down from Github and then swore in my head for an hour when Pyramid would error out and wouldn’t create the database. Which it just should – when Pyramid starts, it looks and if the database doesn’t exist, it looks at the classes I’ve written in SQLAlchemy in my /data directory and creates the database and those tables from the classes. But it wouldn’t. It wasn’t until I was back home later that night that I had an epiphany, created the /db directory manually where the database should live, re-started Pyramid, and voila, my database was there. Now I don’t have to worry about not being portable and can code both at home and on the go.</p>
<p>Tuesday was all about what happens when you first install and setup NFLPool. Since I’m using SQLite, I want to make it easy for me and other to set it up. The easiest thing to do with SQLite is when you need to make changes to the database during development to just delete it and have the app re-create it. Since I’m constantly developing it, I just wanted it easy to re-create and in the case my code is ever used by anyone (it’s on Github, licensed under the GPLv3), it’s better to do this now than try to add this functionality later. (Why GPLv3 and not MIT? My code is so bad being so new to programming, that I want any changes to the source available so I can look at it and learn. Though I’ll probably make it MIT at some point because no one is ever going to use my code, to be honest. Though I could digress on a business model I have brewing…)</p>
<p>Well, the first step in NFLPool is to set up the tables with the team information, which is static – it’s just the team name, the abbreviation, the city, and the division and conference they play in. So I thought I’d make an admin webpage where the admin goes, presses a button, and that database table is populated. It would then re-direct to the next page to create a new season. You enter “2017” for example, and it would reach out to MySportsFeeds and pull all active players in the NFL. Now you’re ready for the players in NFLPool to make their picks.</p>
<p>Sounds easy, and then the next thing I knew it was 7pm and I was asking my wife for help. Using the original prototype, which had working Python code to populate the team info table and the active players, I couldn’t get the team info to populate. I thought this tweet summed it up pretty well:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/paulcutler.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot-2017-08-02-09.56.26.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Turns out I had a return statement at the end of my loop that shouldn’t be there. Took her five minutes – sometimes you just need another set of eyes. The loop itself is terrible code, but it’s working.</p>
<p>The other problem I had was with the template and styling of the Admin page to create the first table. The Chameleon template engine kept crashing on me in my browser – again, she looked at it, pointed out I was missing two divs to close it, and that was working. Coding is fun, I keep telling myself.</p>
<p>After the table populates, which works now, I still don’t have the re-direct working correctly either. I can’t get it to re-direct to a new page – I’m pretty sure it’s how I have the POST and the routes set up in the admin controller. I <em>can</em> get it to redirect back to the same page though after it populates the first table. I need to keep pushing forward as vacation is almost half over, so there’s another thing on the TODO list for Future Paul.</p>
<p>Today is about doing some code cleanup. This includes adding an admin or settings table in the database to store the current season. From there, I can set up a baseurl function that connects to MySportsFeeds and using the season variable above to create the URL needed to get the JSON data needed for that entire season. This way, at the beginning of each season, you don’t have to go in and manually change all this code. I’m hopeful to get this done this morning, but will probably get stuck, but who knows. From there, I have two major pieces to get done:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the code to allow players to make their season picks. From the <strong>Active Players</strong> table, query the database and get a list of all players in a certain position. Then create a form or Javascript to store those in a drop down box. I have no idea how to make a drop down box.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>Account creation / login / authentication. The course has a great chapter on this, I’m not too worried about it.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I can get these done, then players can create their accounts and start making their picks (though I have to store those picks in the database, but I’m feeling confident). In theory, I could launch next week, which is tight. And then the hard part starts: writing all the code to calculate the scores for each player.</p>
<p>Until then, I’ll just keep telling myself this:</p>

            <description>I’ve had to throw in the towel on MongoDB and move back to SQLite for the datastore. For now.
I was successful in being able to call an API, take the JSON object from the API, and store that JSON in MongoDB as a collection. But I what really wanted was to store that JSON object as an EmbeddedDocument within a collection.
My original goal was to stick JSON objects into MongoDB and then query against that.</description>

<p>My original goal was to stick JSON objects into MongoDB and then query against that. I envisioned two collections, one for <em>Users</em> (registration) and the second for the NFL data, called <em>Stats</em>. Stats would have looked like:</p>
<p>Stats</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I read dozens of articles on StackOverflow, Reddit, and others. I tried to code it as an EmbeddedDocument, DynamicFields, and more. Everything ended up as an error. I needed to put the JSON object as an embedded document in each <em>Week</em> document above. But I couldn’t figure out.</p>
<p>I’m out of time. I’ve procrastinated enough and I really want to get a prototype and / or minimum viable product up in the next two weeks. There are two things that are a must:</p>
<ol>
<li>User registration and login system</li>
<li>User pick submission</li>
</ol>
<p>The first one shouldn’t be a problem as how to build a secure user registration system with <code>passlib</code> is included in the <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business">Python for Entrepreneurs course</a>. The second requirements shouldn’t be that hard, but every time I think that, I’m proven wrong.</p>
<p>When I was using SQLite previously, I had all the code written to create the tables and do the initial import of the data needed. I’ll need to re-use some of that code and port the rest from the pure SQL statements I was using to SQLAlchemy.</p>
<p>I was also stuck on what the weekly results table should look like. My wife had some thoughts on it that thoroughly confused me, but when we chatted about it yesterday, neither of us could remember why she was recommending the design she did. I gave it some more thought and I think I have a database model that will work. I’ve written all the class files I need for SQLAlchemy and have taken the week off work to see how much progress I can make.</p>
<p>The big think I need to do is figure out the Javascript within Pyramid and the Chameleon template language to allow a user to make their picks. I have a table that stores all the active players in the NFL with columns for their first name, last name, player ID, team ID and position. I will need to create drop down boxes allowing them to choose, for example, which quarterback they think will lead the league in passing. That part of I have no idea how to do…. yet.</p>
<p>But one thing at a time.</p>

            <description>Yesterday was a good day.
With the static pages for nflpool.xyz complete, I started thinking about the dynamic pages. These are going to require access to the database and I’ll be using MongoDB. I had started the MongoDB course from Talk Python, but put that aside to go back to the Python for Entrepreneurs course to get the site up using Pyramid.
I took a step back and did some brainstorming about the data model I’ll need for the database.</description>

I had started the <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_mongodb_for_python_developers_course/mongodb-for-python-for-developers-featuring-orm-odm-mongoengine">MongoDB course</a> from Talk Python, but put that aside to go back to the <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business">Python for Entrepreneurs</a> course to get the site up using Pyramid.</p>
<p>I took a step back and did some brainstorming about the data model I’ll need for the database. I grabbed a spare whiteboard and started scribbling.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Using MongoDB requires you to shift your mental model from traditional SQL and joining tables as MongoDB doesn’t technically do joins. I needed to think about what a collection looks like and do I embed more documents within a collection or have multiple collections?</p>
<p>I went back through the MongoDB course chapter on Modeling and Document Design. Mr. Kennedy has you ask 6 questions when it comes to embed or not embed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the embedded data wanted 80% of the time?</li>
<li>How often do you want the embedded data without the containing document?</li>
<li>Is the embedded data a bounded set?</li>
<li>Is that bound small?</li>
<li>How varied are your queries?</li>
<li>Is this an integration DB or an application DB?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answers that I came up (that are hopefully correct):</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>Almost always</li>
<li>I’m such a newbie I don’t even know what a bounded set is.</li>
<li>I think so.</li>
<li>Not very.</li>
<li>This is an application database.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keeping in mind that MongoDB has a 16MB limit, which sounds a lot smaller than it really is as I’m only dealing with text and not embedding images or anything like that, the answer is to embed everything.</p>
<p>The next step was to go back through the <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/data-feeds/api-docs/">MySportsFeeds APIs</a> and figure out which ones I’ll be using. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cumulative Player Stats (for individual player picks, such as the passing yards leader)</li>
<li>Roster Players (used for the league players to pick who the individual player leaders are)</li>
<li>Playoff Team Standings (Used for wildcard playoff picks)</li>
<li>Division Team Standings (Used for which teams will finish 1st, 2nd and last in each division)</li>
<li>Conference Team Standings (Used for the team that will lead its conference in points for as well as some team data, such as the team name, abbreviation, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I may want the full game schedule at some point, but that’s a bigger challenge than I need to get into right now.</p>
<p>I ended up deciding that I need two collections within my database:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users: this will store the registration information for each player in the league and be used for logging into the website</li>
<li>Seasons: Here I will embed all of the data for each season of play and have a document for 2016, 2017, etc. Within each year I’ll embed the league player’s picks and then a document for each of the APIs above that has 17 embeds – one for each week of the NFL season. One of my goals is that player can go back to 2016 and look at their progress for each week and see their point total versus the rest of the league. Getting ahead of myself, this will <em>not</em> be available in MLBPool2 (if and when I ever build that) as that will only be a real time look at your score and then show the final year results.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it may look something like this, with two collections: <em>Users</em> and <em>Seasons</em>:</p>
<p>nflpooldatabase</p>
<p>–Users (embed a document for each player in the league in this collection)</p>
<p>–Seasons (Example: “2016” – and then embed the following in the 2016 document:)</p>
<ul>
<li>2016
<ul>
<li>player-picks
<ul>
<li>1 document for each player’s picks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Week 1 through 17 (17 documents total) with the NFL stats for that week embedded here:
<ul>
<li>AFC East</li>
<li>11 more documents for division picks like AFC East above</li>
<li>6 documents for individual leaders</li>
<li>Tiebreaker</li>
<li>Documents for Points For, Wildcard, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2017
<ul>
<li>player-picks</li>
<li>Weeks 1-17 (One document per week)
<ul>
<li>NFL stats with all the embedded documents above</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it was time to re-build the functions to go get the data from the MySportsFeeds API. I had this working in the last iteration of the app when I was using SQLite, but I’ve never used MongoDB before. Over my lunch hour, I successfully prototyped taking one query and putting it into my MongoDB running locally.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The feeling of euphoria in successfully using MongoDB was huge.</p>
<p>Last night after work, I took the next step. Keeping in mind the size limitation of MongoDB, I could take steps to filter the API calls, especially for cumulative stats. I only need a few key stats for a subset of all players in the NFL. For example, I just need passing yards for quarterbacks. The MySportsFeeds API provides a ton of stats for every player – such as fumbles, passes over 20 yards, QB Rating, completions, and defensive stats (even though they’re an offensive player).</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/about-us/">Brad Barkhouse of MySportsFeeds</a> is always available in the MSF Slack channel. I couldn’t figure out how to build a filter for just certain positions <em>and</em> a specific stat. (It turns out it’s just an &amp; sign). So if I just want sacks for defensive players, it looks like this:</p>
<p><code>https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v1.1/pull/nfl/2016-2017-regular/cumulative_player_stats.json?position=LB,SS,DT,DE,CB,FS,SS&amp;amp;playerstats=Sacks</code></p>
<p>So my task for the weekend is to figure out if I want to just embed a document for each individual category or one document with all of the cumulative stats and then just build queries for each category I care about (sacks, interceptions, passing yards, etc.)</p>
<p>I probably should just focus on the next phase of the Python for Entrepreneurs training though, and get the user login and authentication built and then go through the Albums part of the training, which I’ll mimic for the the league players to submit their picks. I’m running out of time as I really have only a few weeks before I need the player picks to be submitted before the start of the season.</p>
<p>Prioritizing is fun. But I’m so happy with some of the breakthroughs and progress and not trying to think of all the challenges ahead and just take it one step at a time.</p>

            <description>I sat down excited at dinner last night excited to share with my wife the two things I learned in my Talk Python course yesterday. The first was learning the basics of CSS, something I’ve avoided for years. I’m not going to even pretend I understand CSS, but it’s a base knowledge to work with and there is still a whole chapter of applied front-end frameworks, so I’m sure there will be more on CSS.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I sat down excited at dinner last night excited to share with my wife the two things I learned in my Talk Python course yesterday. The first was learning the basics of CSS, something I’ve avoided for years. I’m not going to even pretend I understand CSS, but it’s a base knowledge to work with and there is still a whole chapter of applied front-end frameworks, so I’m sure there will be more on CSS.</p>
<p>The second was a cache-busting technique, making it easy to both develop a website and see the changes right away without having to clear the browser cache and great for users that they’ll see the updates in production when it happens.</p>
<p>As I follow along in the <a href="#">Python for Entrepreneurs</a> class, I’m trying something different this time. Rather than code along with the examples and do the examples as Mr. Kennedy does them, I’m trying to build <a href="#">nflpool.xyz</a> using similar code as to what is is in the training. There has been a couple gotchas doing it this way, as you’ll start a chapter doing something one way and then learn a different and better way to do it. Overall, I kind of like doing it the way I’m doing it as the hands-on applications is one of the ways I learn best.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cache-busting code broke Pyramid and I got a myriad of errors in my Chameleon templates. I didn’t realize this until after I had started the routing section of the training and then lost an hour or two trying to trouble shoot the cache-busting. I finally gave up and ripped out cache-busting code from the templates and everything is working again. Well, working without the cache-busting code.</p>
<p>As I worked on the routing section, I’m not going to say I truly understand it yet, but it started to click for me why using a framework like Pyramid using Python makes sense. When I’ve mentioned to a couple of people that I’m going to use Python and Pyramid to build a site, I’m usually asked why I just wouldn’t use Javascript like everyone else these days. For me, focusing on one language at a time and not trying to learn too much is key. I’m pretty sure that I could do everything I want to do with nflpool in Javascript (including both the game calculations and website), but Python’s readability and reputation for being a good language to start with really appeals to me. So why wouldn’t I build it in Python? It gives me more hands-on experience with the language, which I need, and I can include the code needed for the scoring right into the application and don’t have to build two things – the game scoring and a website.</p>
<p>I still have a <strong>lot</strong> to get through this week. I need to finish the applied web development including forms (yay! Maybe I will have the ability to take user picks up by next month. Now, don’t get ahead of myself…); then front-end frameworks with CSS and Bootstrap; the biggest of them all – databases (more on that in a second); as well as account management; and finally, deployment. I skimmed the deployment chapter Sunday night – lots of good stuff (even if they use an Ubuntu VPS in the training) and I’m excited to give Ansible a chance.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about the trainings from Talk Python is that Michael Kennedy offers office hours for a Q&amp;A section if there is something you’re stuck on. The next one is tomorrow, which is perfect. I’m going to see if I can solve my cache-busting problem, and if not, maybe ask for help. I also want to ask him his thoughts on using MongoDB instead of SQLite after taking his <a href="#">MongoDB training</a> last week, while Python for Entrepreneurs uses SQLite.</p>
<p>I’m really enjoying the class and glad I’m making time for it. I don’t know if I’m going to have a skeleton up by the end of the weekend or not, but it’s coming along.</p>

            <description>One of the things I’m not doing well is focusing on one task at a time. As I continue to learn Python, every time I across a way to do something, I want to implement it right away without thinking ahead of how all the different things work together. Then I’ll get stuck, and frustrated, and my pace slows.
I need to find a task, stay on target, and just finish it, rather than jumping from feature to feature.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I’m not doing well is focusing on one task at a time. As I continue to learn Python, every time I across a way to do something, I want to implement it right away without thinking ahead of how all the different things work together. Then I’ll get stuck, and frustrated, and my pace slows.</p>
<p>I need to find a task, stay on target, and just finish it, rather than jumping from feature to feature. With this in my mind, I’ve taken a step back to think about what needs to get done.</p>
<p>There are two major things that need to be built:</p>
<h2 id="nflpoolxyz">nflpool.xyz</h2>
<p>Using <a href="https://trypyramid.com/">Pyramid</a>, I need to get the website up – even if this is just a skeleton. <a href="#">The Python for Entrepreneurs</a> will get me there. I need to follow through and finish the course._</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>Major features for the website include:</p>
<ol>
<li>User creation / management: This includes creating an account, resetting passwords and login / logout. The course does an awesome job of how to properly hash and salt the passwords – I just watched and worked on this chapter yesterday.</li>
<li>Yearly Player Picks: I will need to create a form for each player, after they have created an account, to submit their picks. This form will need to talk to the database to display the list of teams in each conference and the players available in each of the positions. I briefly looked at the Pyramid documentation Friday night and something like WTForms might work for this, but I really know nothing about it at this point. From there the player will need to hit submit, then review their picks or make changes, and then submit their picks which are stored in the database.</li>
<li>Scoring: The last section of the website is the most important part to each player – how are their picks doing against everyone else? One of the reasons I’m using a database is that the cumulative player stats that MySportsFeeds provides are just that – cumulative through the season. There isn’t a way to just get the quarterback stats for week 5 of the 2016 season – so I need to store each weeks stats in the databases. This way a player can track their progress in nflpool through the year. Want to see where they stand right now? Check. Versus two weeks ago? Check. So the website will need to default to the latest week and then let the player choose the year and the week to see past history.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only downside at this time for creating the website is if I want to use sqlite vs mongodb – I’d prefer to use mongodb as I’m stuck on how to create the individual player picks table and wanted to try it as a key / value store in a mongodb collection. The course is focused on SQLite with SQLAlachemy – something I’d like to learn but I think mongodb might also be easier for taking the JSON from <a href="http://www.mysportsfeeds.com">MySportsFeeds</a> and just sticking it right in the database.</p>
<h2 id="nflpool-app">nflpool app</h2>
<p>The app has two major features that need to be completed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import data via JSON from MySportsFeeds into the database: I had all of this done using SQLite. If I choose to switch databases, I’ll need to rewrite this this code.</li>
<li>Scoring calculations: This isn’t done at all. This depends on the player picks table in the database, which is where I was stuck a few months ago when I took a break. I can’t figure out the data model for it no matter how many times my wife tries to explain it to me and I don’t know if I’m just being optimistic when I think a key value store in mongodb would work better. I’m going to give this a bit more thought and actually write out what the document would look like. This would probably be an embedded document in each user’s account.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>With all that said, I think working on the website and getting a skeleton up is the best next step. If I can get the site up, then start to work on the submission form for the picks (which will require a bit of importing team data into a database, so I’ll have to make a decision there), I think I’ll feel a lot better. In a perfect world – and I know this isn’t going to happen in the next 30 – 45 days when I really need it, would be to have the submission form working prior to the 2017 season starting. Even if I have to still calculate the points weekly like I’ve been doing for the last two years, at least I’d have the picks in the database this time instead of having to work with the challenge of Google Sheets.</p>

            <title>MongoDB for Python for Developers</title>

            <description>I’m taking the latest training course that just launched a couple of weeks ago from Michael Kennedy at Talk Python: MongoDB for Python for Developers. This is my first exposure to NoSQL. Over the last year, I’ve searched Google a few different times trying to understand what NoSQL without any success – it always went over my head. Within ten minutes of starting this course, I think I might understand what a document database is.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m taking the latest training course that just launched a couple of weeks ago from Michael Kennedy at Talk Python: <a href="#">MongoDB for Python for Developers</a>. This is my first exposure to NoSQL. Over the last year, I’ve searched Google a few different times trying to understand what NoSQL without any success – it always went over my head. Within ten minutes of starting this course, I think I might understand what a document database is.</p>
<p>I took a break from coding the nflpool app a few months ago after my wife gave me some feedback on how I was designing the data model for the SQLite database I was using. I was pretty frustrated, not with her, but just my lack of knowledge. I still hadn’t figured out how to import the individual player pick’s from the Google Sheet I was using, though I did find some open source code that did it perfectly. The challenge was if I changed the data model, the import functionality was going to change significantly and I couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>Here it is, early July, and I feel the panic of not having the app built for the upcoming NFL season for the second year in a row. That’s ok – it’s a marathon, not a sprint, to learn Python and build the app. Everyone needs a hobby.</p>
<p>I’m going to create a new branch in nflpool and see if I can use MongoDB instead of SQLite. I need to sit down this weekend and give some thought and sketch out the data model for the Users collection, but I think it could (should?) work better than what I was planning. It’s already obvious that importing the the NFL statistics from <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/">MySportsFeeds</a> via JSON directly into MongoDB should be a slam dunk.</p>
<p>The challenge in switching is twofold: First, I’ll need to understand how that changes the <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business">Python For Entrepreneurs</a> course – as I’m going to use Pyramid for the web framework, I’ll need to understand how those will work together. This is especially true for the user accounts and database sections of the course.</p>
<p>The second risk is by switching to MongoDB from a SQL language, there will be no help available from my wife. I might drive her crazy with my questions and the way I ask them, but she has a lot of knowledge of SQL and it might be even more of challenge doing the database on my own, in addition to the Python.</p>
<p>I’m enjoying the MongoDB for Python for Developers course. To be fair, it’s definitely over my head – I’m not a real developer nor do I have any kind of database experience or know any Javascript, so I’m taking it slow and in chunks. I’m not coding the examples as I follow along yet – I’m going to audit the whole course, give some thought to confirm this is what I want to do, and then I’ll go through it again. It’s probably in my best interest to finish Python for Entrepreneurs and get the Pyramid web app up and running. I do enjoy Mr. Kennedy’s courses – the way the courses are structured, how each lecture builds on the others and his delivery makes them worth the money.  Even for some of the topics where I don’t have the prerequisite knowledge I probably should, I find myself learning.  I’m on vacation next week and plan to spend a good chunk of time going through both the Python for Entrepreneurs course and the new MongoDB course.</p>

            <title>Why I enjoy writing user help for GNOME</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2017/03/why-i-enjoy-writing-user-help-for-gnome/</link>

            <description>It’s been almost ten years since I started contributing to open source projects. One of the big ways I’ve contributed in the past is writing user help. Not knowing how to code then (and still really don’t know now, as hard as I try to learn Python), writing is something I enjoy and an area where I think I can make a difference.
There are a number of different places to apply a writing skill in open source.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been almost ten years since I started contributing to open source projects.  One of the big ways I’ve contributed in the past is <a href="http://paulcutler.org/blog/?s=docs&amp;submit=Search">writing user help</a>.  Not knowing how to code then (and still really don’t know now, as hard as I try to learn Python), writing is something I enjoy and an area where I think I can make a difference.</p>
<p>There are a number of different places to apply a writing skill in open source.  You can write release notes, marketing copy, websites and the help documentation for an application.  Writing user help is one I enjoy.</p>
<p>I want to say that writing help is easy – but what’s easy for me, may not be for others.  Those who write an application might say it is easy for them – but as I’m learning, it’s not easy for me.</p>
<p>You can debate who might want to use a Linux desktop and not use Microsoft Windows or macOS.  To me, there are a few different use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers.</li>
<li>Hobbyists.</li>
<li>Users in developing nations.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s these last two groups that I think having up to date user help is important. Using a Linux desktop, such as <a href="https://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>, can be a big change and paradigm shift for a user.  In developing nations, they may not be able to afford a Windows license or the applications they might want to run on Windows.  For example, Photoshop isn’t cheap – but GIMP is free.  If you’re switching to a new operating system, there may be things you don’t know how to do and if there isn’t user help available, how else are you going to learn?  Especially if you’re an area that might not have good internet access.</p>
<p>But having started to learn to code in the last year, I understand why developers don’t write help.  Even with my terrible skills at writing code, when I’m writing a function in Python, I’m not documenting my code as I should be, much less writing a document about how to use the finished application (if it ever gets finished).  You get in the zone and just write code and tell yourself you’ll get to it later.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, when I start an application and can’t figure out how to do something, my first step is to see if I can figure out how to do it myself.  I’ll check to see if there is help built into the application, if not, I’ll check the website.  Having come back to using GNOME a month ago, I was dismayed to find an application I was excited to use to not have either when I was trying to figure out how to use a feature.  (I won’t shame them publicly, and no, they aren’t an application created by GNOME, it’s an actively developed application available on Github).</p>
<p>Although I’ve been using macOS for the last few years, it’s not as if I stopped using open source.  I have open source applications running on my Macbook, a laptop running <a href="https://www.getfedora.org">Fedora</a> though I didn’t use it much, a server at home also running Fedora, and Digital Ocean droplets running CentOS and Fedora.  I strongly believe in open source and love that it’s powered both by people and companies building software in the open for anyone to use or modify.  And that last sentence is important – if anyone can modify it or make it better, why wouldn’t I help if I have the time and / or the skills?</p>
<p>So I did.  Jumping back in with both feet.  After my wife gave me some feedback on the app I’m building that I needed to re-architect a large part of it, I took a break from it for the last week and wrote user help for two apps in GNOME: <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Polari">Polari</a>, an IRC client, and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Recipes">Recipes</a>, a brand new application that does exactly what you think it does.  I’m even poking around the documentation for <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder">Builder</a>, an IDE for building GNOME apps, and editing its developer documentation.  (I won’t even pretend I know how to write developer documentation).  It’s a nice change of pace to use a different part of my brain to write user help while my subconscious figures out how I’m going to fix the data model in my app.</p>
<p>Having been away from the GNOME community for a number of years, I’ve always said the one thing I missed about open source was the people – and it’s been neat to be welcomed back and see some of the same faces.  I love the collaboration.  Maybe someday after I finish my Python webapp I’ll learn GTK and make myself a desktop app out of it.  But let’s not get ahead of myself.</p>

            <description>I followed through on my last blog post and made a lot of progress over the weekend – the best way to learn is by doing. I’ve updated my roadmap for nflpool and broke the development of the nflpool app into chunks:
 0.1: Database creation complete – write the Python code and SQL statements to create all the needed database tables using sqlite3. This includes using the requests module to import all players in the NFL into the database from MySportsFeeds.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I followed through on my <a href="http://paulcutler.org/blog/2017/03/writing-python-to-learn/">last blog post</a> and made a lot of progress over the weekend – the best way to learn is by doing.  I’ve updated my <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/nflpool/blob/master/ROADMAP.md">roadmap</a> for <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/nflpool">nflpool</a> and broke the development of the nflpool app into chunks:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.1: Database creation complete – write the Python code and SQL statements to create all the needed database tables using sqlite3.  This includes using the <code>requests</code> module to import all players in the NFL into the database from <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com">MySportsFeeds</a>.</li>
<li>0.2: Import the 2016 statistics from MySportsFeeds into the database. This includes everything needed to calculate an NFLPool player’s score: individual player statistics, division standings, Wild Card seeds, etc.</li>
<li>0.3: Scoring calculations are complete – the app works. The nflpool app can take every player’s picks, compare it to the final standings, and output everyone’s score for this past 2016 season.</li>
<li>0.4: If 0.3 can calculate the final 2016 standings, 0.4 will add functionality to step through every week individually for 2016 from weeks 1 through 17. This will have to be different code as it won’t use the requests module to get real time data, it will use the JSON data I downloaded weekly last year. This will help me prepare for the 2017 season proving that it can calculate the score each week until the season ends.</li>
<li>0.5: The nflpool app now lives on its website, <a href="https://nflpool.xyz">nflpool.xyz</a>. This will include an online form for the 2017 season where players can make their picks and these picks are inserted into the database. This will be built on <a href="https://trypyramid.com/">Pyramid</a> (after I complete the <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business">Python for Entrepreneurs course from Talk Python</a> to do this.)</li>
<li>1.0: Full nflpool.xyz integration. Players can browse by week for the current season and past seasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this weekend, the 0.1 milestone is complete. I ran into a few challenges, but the database is complete and I even have cumulative NFL Player stats imported as part of the 0.2 milestone. The first challenge I ran into was I could not get the CSV file imported into the sqlite3 database. We originally used a Google Form to capture each player’s picks. I saved that in Google Docs as a CSV file to be imported. I kept getting a too many values to unpack error and no matter how many times I compared the CSV columns to the SQL statement – it was expecting 47 and no matter how many times I checked and re-checked, I couldn’t find my mistake. After doing some Google searches, I came across this <a href="https://github.com/rufuspollock/csv2sqlite">Python script on Github</a> to import a CSV into sqlite – and it worked!</p>
<p>The second challenge I ran into today. I realized after importing the player’s picks and the NFL Player statistics that I was using NFL Player names in the CSV file but I was using the player_id, an integer, from MySportsFeeds for the database. Using the player_id is the correct way to do this, but I needed to modify the CSV and re-import. No problem, but after doing this, I realized I would need to do the same thing again for the Team picks – I need to use the team_id not the team name.</p>
<p>This is all now done and I can move on to the 0.2 milestone. Starting with the five picks for individual stats (passing yards, rushing yards, receiving yards, sacks and interceptions – all already imported using <code>requests</code>!), I’ll write a function that will compare a player’s picks to if the NFL player finished in the top three of that category and assign the correct points. I’ll then add an <code>if</code> statement to see if the nflpool player made a unique pick in that category, and if so, double the points earned.</p>
<p>From there I’ll move on to all the other categories such as Division Standings or Points For and use the same logic.</p>
<p>This is huge progress. The point calculations will be the hardest part of the app (outside of building the website) and now it’s time to see how much Python I’ve learned.</p>

I spent half a day getting my environment set up in Fedora; a half day researching Postgresql vs. MySQL and then getting MySQL set up on my development machine and on my server; a day of actual vacation (yay!), a day taking the latest <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_http_reset_client_course/consuming-http-and-soap-services-in-python-with-json-xml-and-screen-scraping">Talk Python course</a> (<a href="http://paulcutler.org/blog/2017/02/talk-python-training-consuming-http-services-in-python/">helpful – and cool!</a>) and then a day spent trying to learn and figure out how to get MySQL working – which I was never able to.</p>
<p>Looking back, I wish I would have captured what worked well or wasn’t working in my journal at a minimum, so I could turn that into blog posts, or just blogged. When I started this journey to learn Python and build my two apps, I had every intention of doing exactly that. Everyone who has a blog has an intention to write in it – and how many actually do?</p>
<p>I find when sit down to code, one of two things happens. If things are going well, I lose track of time, and next thing I know I have to run the kids to hockey or basketball or it’s time for me to go to bed and I don’t recap what I’ve done. The other is I throw up my hands in frustration because it’s not working and I walk away – also not capturing where I’m stuck or why I’m frustrated.</p>
<p>So here we are again and I’m going to try harder to chronicle my journey. I had a good night last night in just sitting down and reviewing the <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/nflpool">nflpool</a> code I had started. I’ve gone back to using SQLite as the SQL I had written to create the database tables works – making it work with MySQL wasn’t happening and I was sick of losing time and using it as an excuse.  Considering that there are less than 20 people in each of the two leagues, I ‘m not worried about performance right now.  The SQLite code works and I need to make some progress.</p>
<p>Three things I accomplished last night:</p>
<ul>
<li>I created two additional branches in Git. I have a <code>scratchpad</code> branch – this is all my original code from six months ago. It’s terrible. I wasn’t writing functions, it’s not well organized, etc. This was my playground to experiment in trying to put the pieces together. I don’t want to lose these files, so I’ll store them in their own branch, but they won’t be used again. I created a <code>develop</code> branch – this is where I’m doing all my active development. When things are working as they should be, I’ll do a pull request and merge them into <code>master</code>. I don’t know if this is the “right” workflow, but it will work for me.</li>
<li>I had three or four different Python scripts to create the tables in SQLite. I <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/nflpool/blob/master/create_tables.py">created one Python file</a> to create all of the tables I’ll need and created a function for each table. I tweaked some of the columns in a few of the tables after reviewing my data model, realizing that some tables didn’t capture the year or season. I added a main method to call all of these functions. I then deleted the Python scripts that did this individually and merged these changes into <code>master</code>.</li>
<li>Lastly, and maybe most important, when I was done for the night, I grabbed my notebook and made a to-do list of what to work on next. For example: one of the tables imports some information needed for the NFL Teams (their city, abbreviation, etc.) This data never changes, but I was importing it from JSON data I downloaded from <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/">MySportsFeeds</a>. This needs to be re-written to make a request to the MySportsFeeds API to get the data rather than loading a file into memory. (Just in case anyway ever wants to re-use this code to run the same pool – I don’t ever see that happening, but it’s best to do it right the first time). This way I know where to pick up when I start again and should reduce the time reviewing the code to figure out what to work on next.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progress!</p>

            <description>Summary / tl;dr: Consuming HTTP Services in Python is a great addition to the training courses from Talk Python and Michael Kennedy. You’ll come away with a thorough knowledge of the best way to get data from the internet using the requests module; you’ll use real world examples and APIs from Basecamp, Github and a custom API Michael built just from the course; Michael will explain and show the concepts in an easy to learn manner with a little humor and recap each concept to make sure you understand.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Summary / tl;dr</em></strong><em>: Consuming HTTP Services in Python is a great addition to the training courses from Talk Python and Michael Kennedy. You’ll come away with a thorough knowledge of the best way to get data from the internet using the requests module; you’ll use real world examples and APIs from Basecamp, Github and a custom API Michael built just from the course; Michael will explain and show the concepts in an easy to learn manner with a little humor and recap each concept to make sure you understand.</em></p>
<p>In addition to being host of the well known Talk Python podcast, Michael Kennedy has also created a number of Python training courses. The first, <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/python-language-jumpstart-building-10-apps">Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps</a>, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikeckennedy/python-jumpstart-by-building-10-apps-video-course">launched its Kickstarter</a> exactly a year ago this month, and was quickly followed later in the year with <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business">Python for Entrepreneurs</a> on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikeckennedy/python-for-entrepreneurs-video-course?ref=profile_created">Kickstarter</a> and <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_pythonic_code/write-pythonic-code-like-a-seasoned-developer">Write Pythonic Code Like a Seasoned Developer.</a></p>
<p>I <a href="http://paulcutler.org/blog/2016/10/next-class-up-python-jumpstart-by-building-10-apps/">started</a> and finished Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps late last year and loved it. It was a very different <a href="http://paulcutler.org/blog/2016/09/python-for-everybody-at-coursera-with-dr-chuck/">learning experience than the University of Michigan’s Python for Everybody class on Coursera</a>. There is an assumption with the Talk Python training courses that you have some basic understanding of computer science or programming. I don’t, so I typically go a little slower and take my time with the courses.</p>
<p>Looking back. there are a few things I liked about the Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps course and I was glad to see continue in this latest course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael makes it very easy to follow along in the beginning of the courses. Everyone learns differently, but one of the ways I learn best is to follow along by typing the code as he does in the video, helping me commit it to memory.</li>
<li>After teaching you a core concept and coding it into one of the apps, Michael recaps what you’ve just learned in its own “Concept” video. This summarizes the concept you just put into practice and reinforces what you’ve learned.</li>
<li>Compared to some of the other online courses I’ve taken, I really like that I know I’m learning from someone well known in the community and I believe I’m not just learning how to code, but coding best practices. I don’t know if I’m explaining this right, but as an example: A few of the online classes I’ve taken haven’t had me put the code into functions and then call them in a main(): function, for example.</li>
<li>The source code to the examples Michael teaches you is on Github. You can download it, star it, fork it – but it’s available if you want to follow along, code along as the course goes, or just save it for reference for the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve shared my enthusiasm for the Talk Python training courses here and on Twitter and when Michael reached out to me last week asking if I was interested in having a sneak peek at his latest course, <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_http_reset_client_course/consuming-http-and-soap-services-in-python-with-json-xml-and-screen-scraping">Consuming HTTP Services in Python</a>, I jumped at it (after making sure he knew I was still a novice early in my Python learning curve). I took a look at the course overview and this is right in my wheelhouse of what I need to learn. A core part of the app I want to build is exactly what this course is about – using the requests module to download at least a half dozen JSON feeds and then building my app around that. (My app is to build the scoring for a custom <a href="http://mlbpool2.com/rules/nfl-pool-rules/">NFL Pool league</a> – it’s not a fantasy league, it’s different. All of the data comes from <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/">MySportsFeeds,</a> who provides sports data via JSON or XML which I will consume, store in a database, and then write a Python program to calculate the league and player scores to be displayed on the <a href="https://nflpool.xyz">league website</a>.)</p>
<p>What I really liked about this course was that it was focused on one thing: consuming services. I’ve taken a few different Python courses online as I try and learn Python, and most are throwing all the basics that you need to know – everything you’d expect in a beginner course, but it does get overwhelming. This was the first course I’ve taken that was focused on getting you really good at one thing, and in a few different ways that you might need to do it.</p>
<p>Immediately, I learn something new. I only knew of requests from I learned using Google and Stack Overflow. When I started playing around and putting together the building blocks of my app, I wrote the following code. MySportsFeed currently using HTTP Basic Authentication, so I have a separate file called secret.py that stores my username and password – I may be new to Python, but I’m smart enough to have created that, import it and add it to my .gitignore file!</p>
<p>This code polls the Playoff Team Standings feed on MySportsFeeds and then I have <a href="https://github.com/prcutler/nflpool/blob/master/team_rank_request.py">some (ugly) Python code</a> that runs a for loop to rank each of the two NFL Conferences teams from 1 to 16.</p>
<pre><code>response = requests.get(
    'https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/api/feed/pull/nfl/2016-2017-regular/playoff_team_standings.json?teamstats',
    auth=HTTPBasicAuth(secret.msf_username, secret.msf_pw))

rawdata = response.content
data = json.loads(rawdata.decode())
</code></pre>
<p>And what did I learn? As I tweeted last week:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now my code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>response = requests.get(
    'https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/api/feed/pull/nfl/2016-2017-regular/playoff_team_standings.json?teamstats',
    auth=HTTPBasicAuth(secret.msf_username, secret.msf_pw))

data = response.json()
</code></pre>
<p>It’s not a lot, it’s just one line of code, but it’s these little things. I had no idea the power of requests – this is just one specific example of something I learned from this course. Another thing I learned? I should be taking the URL in the above eample, create a base_url variable and then append the feed name as another variable. This is covered in a later chapter of the course – <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/player/start_chapter/3007">Consuming RESTful HTTP services.</a> This chapter has a ton of great examples I’m going to be referencing when writing my app and using.</p>
<p>The Consuming RESTful HTTP services chapter is where the course really starts to take off. I ran into this with the Jumpstart course as well – Michael does a great job in teaching you the building blocks and then the course seems to go from 0-60. This is where having previous programming experience is helpful as that jump from learning what each puzzle piece does to how you put the puzzle together clicks. For someone like me, without any programming experience, it’s a big jump, but possible.</p>
<p>With that said, this chapter is fantastic. While I had a cursory knowledge of HTTP commands like GET and PUT, the API Michael built for the course is awesome. You have the opportunity to create your own examples and interact with the API and blog explorer app – this isn’t something you see with most online courses out there.</p>
<p>I also learned that I only want to use requests, and not built-ins. Though I do now have an understanding of the urlib built-in for Python 3.x if I’m ever cornered and have to use it.</p>
<p>I will admit to skipping the chapter on SOAP. I’m a hobbyist, not an enterprise developer who may encounter SOAP. But it’s great this available for those who may need it as part of this course. This, combined with learning how to use JSON, XML, and screen scraping makes it a complete course.</p>
<p>The last chapter is on screen scraping. There are a ton of of tutorials and classes available on the web about screen scraping. I’ve taken a few of them – one of the challenges I have with my app is figuring out the playoff seeding and I thought about scraping NFL.com, but that’s a different story. This chapter kicks off with an example of using a site’s sitemap.xml – an example I’ve never seen before that makes so much sense once you learn about it. And if a website you want to scrape doesn’t have a sitemap.xml, shame on them for not being search engine friendly. But if they don’t, Michael goes through other ways to scrape a website using Beautiful Soup and does it in the most Pythonic way I’ve seen yet in a course.</p>
<p>I enjoyed Consuming HTTP Services in Python. With the requests module and JSON being a cornerstone of the app I hope to write, it was great to learn about everything I need to know to make that happen. Michael’s delivery is conversational and he makes it easy to follow along and do the code examples with him, if you choose to. If you have programming experience or are coming from a different language, the videos themselves will probably teach you what you need to do in Python. If you’re like me, a complete novice to Python, you’ll be able to follow along, but be prepared for the jump the course will make in the Consuming RESTful HTTP Services chapter – this moves pretty quickly, but if you’ve forked the Github repo you’ll have access to the program Michael has written and you can (and should) write your own examples to interact with the API on the blog explorer. For $39, you’re getting a well developed course from someone well known in the Python community teaching you the Pythonic way interact with services. While other online training sites might have “sales” that are cheaper, as someone new to Python who has taken some of those courses, trust me – the Talk Python courses are well worth the money.</p>
<p>I’m still early in my Python journey and the two courses I’ve finished from Talk Python have been the best learning resources I’ve used out of all the books and training I’ve purchased (and it’s a lot). I’m still working my way through Python for Entrepreneurs and am really <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/all">looking forward to two of the upcoming courses using SQLAlchemy</a> as this database stuff is way over my head right now. Thanks again to Michael for allowing me to have a preview of the Consuming HTTP Services course – now it’s time for me to take his advice from the last chapter of the course and write some code – the best way to actually learn.</p>

            <description>I have been considering switching back to GNOME full-time and finally pulled the trigger last week and did, installing Fedora 25 on both my iMac and MacBook Pro. I installed GNOME on my iMac a couple months ago, but didn’t do the installation correctly and screwed up my MBR, resulting in only GNOME being an option. I’ve fixed that this time and have kept dual boot (for just in case and for iTunes on my iPhone and iPad).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been considering switching back to GNOME full-time and finally pulled the trigger last week and did, <a href="http://paulcutler.org/blog/2017/02/why-im-going-back-to-linux-after-five-years-of-using-macos/">installing Fedora 25 on both my iMac and MacBook Pro</a>. I installed <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> on my iMac a couple months ago, but didn’t do the installation correctly and screwed up my MBR, resulting in only GNOME being an option. I’ve fixed that this time and have kept dual boot (for just in case and for iTunes on my iPhone and iPad).</p>
<p>The more I’ve thought about this over the last couple months, the more I have wanted to go back to GNOME. The privacy concerns I have about the big tech companies continues to nag at me and there is something about the open source ethos that appeals to me. I may even switch back to Android from iOS if this works well.</p>
<p>I will still be tied to the Apple ecosystem with my work laptop. That’s both good and bad as I think about the few apps that have held me back from making the switch full time. The only alternative would be to switch to Windows, which is never going to happen. I haven’t used Windows since 2004 and considering what Microsoft has done with tracking in Windows 10…</p>
<p>There are a handful of apps on macOS that just don’t have a Linux equivalent, or if they do, aren’t close from a usability experience. The last three are the big ones for me. I also see the irony in that those three apps are some of most expensive applications I’ve purchased through the Mac App Store. You do get what you pay for and I really shouldn’t be comparing these, especially the last two which Apple has featured as apps of the year previously, to free and open source apps. I should be grateful that there are programmers out in the open source world making applications and offering them without charge rather than trying to compare them to Mac equivalents.</p>
<p>In no particular order, the apps I’ll most the most:</p>
<h2 id="messages">Messages</h2>
<p>I love text messaging from my desktop (and the immediacy of the notifications). I’m old, shouting <em>Get Off My Lawn</em> and just don’t like tapping on virtual keyboards compared to a real keyboard hooked up to a computer. But I can live without this.</p>
<p><em>Status: Can live without this.</em></p>
<h2 id="pocket">Pocket</h2>
<p>The web client is pretty good and I’ll probably continue to use the iPad as the primary reading device for Pocket. I can live without this. Firefox has a save to Pocket add-on that works just fine.</p>
<p><em>Status: Can live without this.</em></p>
<h2 id="reeder">Reeder</h2>
<p>Reeder is my RSS reader of choice, and there are a number of RSS readers available on Linux. Feedbin, the replacement service for Google Reader that I pay for annually, also has a decent web interface. New links open in a tab in the browser instead of Reeder’s readability feature. I’ll miss Reeder.</p>
<p><em>Status: Can live without it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I’ve found <a href="https://jangernert.github.io/FeedReader/">FeedReader</a> in the Fedora 25 repositories. Version 1.6 is in the repo, but the developer has also made a <a href="http://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a> available for <a href="https://github.com/jangernert/FeedReader/releases">version 2.0 that was released two days ago and I’m now running</a>. A few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>This has fantastic usability. Almost to the level of Reeder. This is a slam dunk as far as RSS readers go.</li>
<li>I installed the Flatpak because version 2.0 adds support for both Feedbin and Pocket as a read it later service. Feedbin suport is working great and after upgrading from the 2.0 beta to 2.0 final, Pocket support is working flawlessly. FeedReader automatically added Pocket as a service since I had it configured in GNOME Online Accounts.</li>
<li>A big thank you and shout out to the developers for taking the time to release a Flatpak making it easy for users to upgrade to the latest version.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Updated Status: Found a replacement that is just as good as one of the best Mac apps.</em></p>
<h2 id="1password">1Password</h2>
<p>Considering all the work I did over the Christmas holiday to change weak passwords to strong passwords and removing duplicates, and also the integration with iOS, this is a big loss as there is no Linux client for 1Password. There are a few password management alternatives on Linux, but I don’t know how good they are. Ryan C. Gordon aka icculus did write a 1Password script for Linux that may be worth checking out: <a href="https://icculus.org/1pass/">https://icculus.org/1pass/</a></p>
<p><em>Status:</em> <em>More research needed and may just need to switch to Encryptr or Enpass.</em></p>
<h2 id="tweetbot">Tweetbot</h2>
<p>Ouch. This one hurts. I love Twitter, it’s the only social network I’m active on. I love syncing my Twitter reading experience between all my devices, which Tweetbot does better than any other application out there, regardless of platform or operating system. I’ve installed Corebird on Fedora and it’s ok, but it’s not Tweetbot.</p>
<p><em>Status: This one hurts. I can probably confine myself to Twitter on iOS and use Pocket to save and read links.</em></p>
<h2 id="ulysses">Ulysses</h2>
<p>I love, love, love writing in Ulysses. It’s hands down the best writing app I’ve ever used after trying Scrivener, Hemingway and others. The iCloud integration is great, making it easy to jump to and from other devices, including iOS. I am using Ulysses to not only write for my blog and journal (then importing into Day One) but also as an Evernote replacement after Evernote screwed everyone over with their privacy settings (though they would later backtrack, I’ve lost all trust in them). Like most of the great Mac apps, they’re Apple only. If I’m writing anything, I’m always starting in Ulysses.</p>
<p>I’m using Dropbox Paper right now to try it out as a replacement for Ulysses, and while Paper is close, it’s lack of true Markdown support while writing bugs me. It’s not too bad if I open it in its own browser window and then use it in its own workspace – this makes it feel like more of a writing app and not a browser. I’ve spent significant time learning Markdown for both Ulysses and Day One, so Dropbox Paper missing real keyboard shortcuts for Markdown kind of sucks (some work, like strong and italics, but others, like headings, don’t). I’ve installed the Markdown plugin in WordPress, making it easy to copy and paste drafts from Ulysses to my blog or to Day One. It is possible to export Dropbox Paper as Markdown and after a cursory glance there are some decent looking Markdown editors available on Linux, so there may be hope.</p>
<p><em>Status: Can probably live without it. But I’m not happy about it.</em></p>
<h2 id="day-one">Day One</h2>
<p>This is probably the biggest one for me. If I love Ulysses, I love Day One more. And like Ulysses, Day One is exclusively in the Apple ecosystem. Ironically, I don’t write in my journal nearly as much as I should. But I love the integration with IFTTT and use it to track all of my exercise entries from Endomondo. I spent an hour looking at journaling options on Linux last week, and there are a couple, but I don’t see a way to sync the entries between computers, which is a must have feature. One option is to continue to use Day One on my work laptop or use a Markdown editor on Linux, save in Dropbox, and then import. I’ve also come across <a href="https://github.com/maebert/jrnl">jrnl</a>, a command line journaling app that says it works with Day One, but I really love the user experience of Day One’s app. This one hurts the most – Day One was one of the first apps I ever bought in the Mac App Store and I have years of journal entries in there.</p>
<p><em>Status: Ouch. I really don’t want to miss this. I’m not ready to start journaling in another app, so I’ll probably just write drafts in Dropbox Paper and then use my work laptop for journal entries.</em></p>

            <description>I’ve been a supporter of the Electronic Frontier Foundation since 2004. Their work on privacy, free expression and technology are all things I am passionate about. For the last year or so, I have become more concerned with privacy issues in technology. The rise in big data and how everything is tracking everything we do has given me significant concerns. I’ve been giving a lot of thought to which ecosystems I want to stay in.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been a supporter of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> since 2004. Their work on privacy, free expression and technology are all things I am passionate about. For the last year or so, I have become more concerned with privacy issues in technology. The rise in big data and how everything is tracking everything we do has given me significant concerns. I’ve been giving a lot of thought to which ecosystems I want to stay in. I’m not going to say I trust any of these technology companies, but I can control (or minimize) my footprint with some of these companies.</p>
<p>Last year I took a number of steps in this direction:</p>
<ul>
<li>I deleted my Facebook and Instagram accounts. I don’t think I need to go into detail here, but Facebook isn’t something you would ever equate with the word “privacy”.</li>
<li>After Evernote said they would access your notes and data (only to backtrack later) I quickly stopped using Evernote.</li>
<li>I’m paying cash for most of my personal purchases and now shopping local and not online – even if I have to pay a bit more for things such as records, books or cycling gear.</li>
<li>I went through and deleted over a hundred online accounts over the Christmas break and used a password manager to make sure I wasn’t using duplicate passwords online and also that I was using secure passwords.</li>
<li>I’m no longer using Flickr (and Yahoo services in general) for my photos and I have a tough decision to make about whether I delete that account and remove access to the photos there. (Wikipedia using a number of my Green Bay Packer photos under a Creative Commons license).</li>
<li>I switched to DuckDuckGo instead of Google as my default search engine.</li>
<li>As much as I’m intrigued by Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home, I won’t buy a voice activated device. Just think about what data it knows about you – what smart devices in your house, what your saying around it – and the recent story in the news how a police department wants the data scares the shit out of me.</li>
<li>I’m not using TouchID on my iOS devices. Courts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/31/court-rules-touch-id-is-not-protected-by-the-fifth-amendment-bu/">have ruled multiple times</a> that your fingerprint is not protected under the Fifth Amendment – but a passcode is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, I sound paranoid. But at the end of the day, this is my decision and my choice. I may not have anything to hide, but I don’t believe just because we have the technology means that it always needs to be used to collect everything about you. While I will never be able to erase everything about me online or with these technology companies – nor would I necessarily want to – I can control with whom I do business and make conscious choices about it. This way I can be eyes wide open that yes, I’ve been using Gmail since it first launched and that Google knows almost everything about me. But that’s my choice to stay within Google’s ecosystem (for now). even if I start to use less of their services, such as switching to DuckDuckGo for internet searches.</p>
<p>I stopped using Microsoft Windows in 2003 when I switched to using Linux full time until about 2012 when I started using macOS after buying my first MacBook. I love Apple’s hardware and I like macOS – the same Unix internals underneath, lots of polish, and excellent apps. Everything just works – you don’t have to fiddle with video card drivers or wireless. But you will have to do things the way Apple wants you to (see: iTunes). Integreation with iOS is great – answer phone calls on your Mac, reply to text messages. But who knows what Apple is tracking as well as the apps you’re using (I’m looking at you Evernote). And don’t get me started on the Touch Bar on the new MacBooks. (No Escape key? Really?)</p>
<p>So I’m going back to using Linux on the desktop after five+ years away. There is no question that the macOS user experience is significantly better. But using the <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> desktop on <a href="http://www.getfedora.org">Fedora</a> is pretty close and gets better every release. I’ll know my computing experience is secure and private. I’ll probably share some thoughts on what key applications I’ll miss most in a separate blog post. I’ll still need to use macOS at my day job, but I can control what I use at home and have the peace of mind that nothing is tracking me (outside of what’s in my web browser) when using my own computers.</p>

            <description>Dwayne Crooks wrote a fabulous blog post this week with his advice on learning Python efficiently.
Being a year into my journey, I couldn’t agree with him more. He lists five mistakes that hamper our ability to learn efficiently. Below I’ve listed his five mistakes with where I am in my journey in italics.
 Reading a book cover to cover. I strongly agree with this one. This was the first mistake I made a year ago when I decided I wanted to learn Python.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dwayne Crooks wrote a <a href="http://www.simplydjango.com/learn-python-efficiently/">fabulous blog post this week with his advice on learning Python efficiently</a>.</p>
<p>Being a year into my journey, I couldn’t agree with him more. He lists five mistakes that hamper our ability to learn efficiently. Below I’ve listed his five mistakes with where I am in my journey in italics.</p>
<ol>
<li>Reading a book cover to cover. <em>I strongly agree with this one. This was the first mistake I made a year ago when I decided I wanted to learn Python. I bought Think Python and Learning Python and quickly realized I am not the type of learner who can learn from reading and trying to follow along.</em></li>
<li>Diving in without a plan. <em>Check! Yes, I have a plan. I know what I want to build. Whew.</em></li>
<li>Failing to narrow your scope. <em>I think I’m ok on this one? Let’s just quote this one in full from Mr. Crooks:</em></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>&gt; _Having clear boundaries makes it easy to decide whether or not a new resource is worth your time. That&amp;#8217;s why learning Python by trying to build something in it is a great way to go. You&amp;#8217;d realize how much of Python you don&amp;#8217;t need to know in order to accomplish any one task. You&amp;#8217;ll find that the more you narrow your scope at the beginning, the more you&amp;#8217;ll learn and the faster you&amp;#8217;ll progress._

_The challenge for me in understanding this one, is if you’re new to Python, how do you know where to draw the boundaries? When I get stuck, I revisit some of the classes I’ve taken or search Stack Overflow. I quickly realize how much I don’t know when I find a new way to do something or come across something related but that I don’t need. But knowing what I want to build probably expands my scope instead of narrowing it._&lt;/li&gt; 

  * Trying to learn 2 (or more) things at the same time. _I’m being very careful with this one. I want to have a prototype of my application working before I move on to my next class, [Python for Entrepreneurs][2], which will teach me how to build my application using Pyramid. The course will also cover CSS, Bootstrap and more web technologies. Where I’m struggling though is on my prototype &amp;#8211; do I just build the prototype or do I try and learn some basic SQL, which is what the web app version will need? My head has been in the right spot on this one as I’ve tried to avoid learning SQL up until now._
  * Spending too much time studying before you have experience doing. _Mr. Crooks hits this one on the head and is basically describing me: **Because we&amp;#8217;re afraid to fail, we want to know what we&amp;#8217;re doing before we ever try. So we spend a lot of time learning before ever trying to apply any of it.** I’m wired to be a “learner” and do a deep dive into anything before I pull the trigger. Whether it’s a ton of research before buying a new TV or learning a new skill, this describes me well. But I think I’m ok on this one. If you were to look through my Github repo for nflpool (please don’t), you would see a mishmash of Python. There’s probably 25 files in my repo that is basically just a scratchpad for me trying to figure out how to parse JSON or trying to write a for loop to get the results I need. There’s nothing Pythonic in there (yet). For example, I’m not using functions like I should. But once I get the different pieces working, I’ll refactor it the right way. You can argue whether I should be starting it right or not, but I’m diving in and trying to figure it out piece by piece. You have to start somewhere…_&lt;/ol&gt; 

Mr. Crooks then goes on and shares his five steps to get started. I’m happy to see I’m on the right track.

            <description>It was Black Friday of 2015. O’Reilly put on a sale of their programming ebooks and I was finally ready to take the plunge and learn Python. I bought three books:
 Learning Python 5th edition by Mark Lutz Python Pocket Reference by Mark Lutz Think Python 2nd edition by Allen B. Downey  I then signed up for a Coursera class, Python for Everybody, taught by Dr. Charles Severance and started the class.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was Black Friday of 2015. O’Reilly put on a sale of their programming ebooks and I was finally ready to take the plunge and learn Python. I bought three books:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028154.do">Learning Python 5th edition by Mark Lutz</a></li>

<li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920045267.do">Think Python 2nd edition by Allen B. Downey</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I then signed up for a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Coursera class, Python for Everybody</a>, taught by Dr. Charles Severance and started the class. I was ready to do this. I needed a hobby. I had a problem to solve.</p>
<p>Then real life got in the way. A few months earlier, we started building a new house. In January it was time to sell our house, which meant hours of work. Then in February, we moved.</p>
<p>I put learning Python on the back burner. Before I knew it, it was July, and another six months had gone by. It was now fantasy football season and that was the problem I had to solve. I needed a program that would keep track of all football statistics and standings and automatically calculate each player’s points. It was time.</p>
<p>I re-started the Coursera course and spent the time. I was easily spending twenty hours a week reading the course materials, watching the videos and doing the homework.</p>
<p>I confirmed what I knew about myself: I learn best by doing, not just reading or watching videos. The books I had bought were helpful, but just sitting down and reading them, trying to follow along and do the exercises was difficult. Python for Everybody on Coursera was great.</p>
<p>I finished that and moved on to <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/python-language-jumpstart-building-10-apps">Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps by Michael Kennedy</a>, which I had purchased in early 2016 via a Kickstarter campaign. I’m almost done with that a year after I started this journey.</p>
<p>Learning to code in Python is hard. I don’t have a background in computer science and with some of the concepts that the books and courses teach I just don’t have the base knowledge necessary. This sometimes makes it harder and takes longer to understand the concepts. I’m lucky that my wife has worked professionally as a programmer in multiple languages, including Java and SQL. But I drive her crazy when I ask her questions about concepts I clearly don’t understand. I use the wrong terminology or fail to grasp what I’ve been taught.</p>
<p>I don’t know how much I’ve retained from the classes and books. I’m trying to build my application in parallel with my learning. I’m convinced the only way I’m going to learn is to build something, which is a piece of advice most often found online for people aspiring to learn programming. I’m constantly hitting up Google and Stack Overflow when I get stuck. I’ll copy bits and pieces of code from these search results and I’m always doubting whether I understand what I’m copying. I’ve signed up for multiple newsletters and bookmarked dozens of websites with articles on how to learn, code snippets, programming challenges and more. I’m overwhelmed with the concepts I’m learning and I know I don’t understand, let alone use, these concepts.</p>
<p>But I’m going to keep trying. The only way I’ll learn is by building something. The code will be ugly. It will break. And I’ll keep updating it until it works and as I learn more, I’ll make it more elegant.</p>
<p>Here’s to another year.</p>

            <description>Last weekend I discovered how to pretty print the five JSON files I get from MySportsFeeds. This was helpful to understand just how much data is nested within each file. I also spent a good chunk of the weekend writing in a notebook. I mostly did some data modeling on what each table in the database should store and what their primary keys would be. I also captured things I need to research and started breaking the project into chunks.</description>

This was helpful to understand just how much data is nested within each file. I also spent a good chunk of the weekend writing in a notebook. I mostly did some data modeling on what each table in the database should store and what their primary keys would be. I also captured things I need to research and started breaking the project into chunks. As I tweeted out over the weekend:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Monday was a holiday so I did the first four courses of Python Jumpstart. I took a break and went back to the JSON files I had worked with. My goal was to build with what should be the easiest table and pull the team data out. This is a dictionary that includes the team name (Texans), city (Houston), abbreviation (HOU) and id (64). The ID number is supplied in the JSON feed and is unique, so I will use that as the primary key. There will be two more columns in the table for conference and division, but I wanted to deal with that later.</p>
<p>I wrote a for loop to try and pull out each team’s information. I quickly got stuck and nothing was working. At one point, the loop I had written worked, but only pulled out the data for the first ranked team. I showed my wife my code and she pointed out that it wasn’t iterating in a loop.</p>
<p>I was stuck for two nights working on this after dinner. I finally stepped back and modified my pretty print Python program and started breaking down all of the information in the JSON file again. I figured out what was a list and what was a dictionary and what was nested where. (It looks like I didn’t commit this to the <a href="https://github.com/pcutler/nflpool">git repo</a>, oops! Will have to fix that.)</p>
<p>After doing this last night, I found the list I needed to work with. I then re-wrote my for loop and I was able to iterate through all 16 teams in the AFC:</p>
<pre><code>for afc_team_list in teamlist:

afc_team_name = data[&quot;conferenceteamstandings&quot;][&quot;conference&quot;][0][&quot;teamentry&quot;][x][&quot;team&quot;][&quot;Name&quot;]

afc_team_city = data[&quot;conferenceteamstandings&quot;][&quot;conference&quot;][0][&quot;teamentry&quot;][x][&quot;team&quot;][&quot;City&quot;]

afc_team_id = data[&quot;conferenceteamstandings&quot;][&quot;conference&quot;][0][&quot;teamentry&quot;][x][&quot;team&quot;][&quot;ID&quot;]

afc_team_abbr = data[&quot;conferenceteamstandings&quot;][&quot;conference&quot;][0][&quot;teamentry&quot;][x][&quot;team&quot;][&quot;Abbreviation&quot;]

print((afc_team_name),&quot;,&quot;,(afc_team_city),&quot;,&quot;,(afc_team_id),&quot;,&quot;,(afc_team_abbr))

x = x + 1
</code></pre>
<p>I then <a href="https://github.com/pcutler/nflpool/blob/master/import_team_info.py">copied and pasted and did it again for the NFC</a>. I did try, unsuccessfully, to modify the conference list – <a href="#">“conference”</a><a href="#"></a> – so I could just write one for loop instead of one for each of the two conferences. But it was working, so I’ll leave it for now. (I’m sure my code is ugly, but hey, I’m just starting).</p>
<p>After that it was all about writing the SQL insert statements to put this into a SQLite3 database. (For now, later it will go into MySQL). That took me a an hour, but at the end, I got it working and was even able to add the conference name to each row.</p>
<p>Next up, I need to take the data in the Division standings JSON file. In it is stored the division name for each division in a conference: <code>AFC/AFC-East</code>. I’ll need to write a for loop to grab it, slice it to remove the “AFC/“ and then stick that in the Division field for each team in the Teams table. I’ll also need to stop dropping and re-creating the table each time I insert data, but it’s working.</p>
<p>Progress!</p>

            <description>I’m glad I started with the Python for Everybody specialization at Coursera before jumping into Python Jumpstart by building 10 Python Apps by Michael Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy moves fast. I’ve completed the first four apps and it’s good to get a refresher on the information I learned in Python for Everybody.
I also spent part of the weekend sketching in a notebook. I did some brainstorming about the database design I’ll need for NFLPool.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m glad I started with the Python for Everybody specialization at Coursera before jumping into Python Jumpstart by building 10 Python Apps by Michael Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy moves <em>fast</em>. I’ve completed the first four apps and it’s good to get a refresher on the information I learned in Python for Everybody.</p>
<p>I also spent part of the weekend sketching in a notebook. I did some brainstorming about the database design I’ll need for NFLPool. I learned one of the bigger differences between MySQL and Postgresql is that MySQL does not have the ability to use foreign keys but MySQL is much faster. The lack of foreign keys may make the design a bit tougher, but more on that later in a different blog post.</p>
<p>I also sketched out some ideas for the functions I’m going to need to write so I’m not writing the same bit of code over and over again. From there, I created a to-do list of things to start working through. I find this whole process of building an app overwhelming. I never thought I’d be using paper and pencil so much, but I’ve found it helpful to break this into smaller chunks and attack them one at a time.</p>
<p>Then I started working on the import process for the JSON. This quickly derailed as I realized just how many stats MySportsFeeds captures from an NFL game. That quickly turned in to writing a JSON pretty print statement so I could see how the five different JSON files nested their dictionaries.</p>
<p>I currently download five JSON files every Tuesday via a cron job with all the statistics. I know my app won’t be ready for the 2016 season and my hope is by having 17 weeks of data, I can re-create the season to test my app to make sure it’s scoring each player correctly as we move through the season week by week. When I download the JSON via curl, it includes all the web headers, such as:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 21 Sep 2016 12:16:07 GMT
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Cache-Control: must-revalidate, no-store, s-maxage=0, max-age=0, private
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, Content-Type, Accept, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Authorization
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Content-Encoding: gzip
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, OPTIONS
Content-Type: application/json
Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=B7548F2309747418749B5421282A5E08; Path=/leaguemanager-web/; HttpOnly
Vary: User-Agent
Connection: close
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
</code></pre>
<p>And then the JSON starts right after that with curly braces. I was proud of myself as I wrote an if statement to load the file, read the lines, and load the JSON when finding the curly braces. Then I wrote code to first print out all the statistics categories (commented out below) and pretty print all the JSON:</p>
<pre><code>import json
import pprint
import os

#Open the JSON file that includes headers


#Change the name of the file to open to match the query below:
with open(&amp;#039;json/20160921-division-team-standings.json&amp;#039;) as file:
    alltext = file.readlines()  #Put each line into a list

# division-team-standings.json
for lines in alltext:
    if lines.startswith(&amp;#039;{&amp;#039;):
        rawdata = lines
        data = json.loads(rawdata)
#        for stat_categories in data[&quot;divisionteamstandings&quot;][&quot;division&quot;][0][&quot;teamentry&quot;][0][&quot;stats&quot;]:
#            pprint.pprint(stat_categories)   #Print all the categories in &quot;stats&quot;
        pprint.pprint(data)  #Print the JSON
</code></pre>
<p>I had five files to review and I just manually changed the code to the file I wanted and had a code block for each of the files. I know I probably should have just wrote a function, but I was in the zone. (My code probably isn’t very Pythonic either, but I have to start somewhere on this journey). I also know that when it comes time to build the real app I’ll be loading the JSON across the network and not from a local file, but future Paul gets to deal with that.</p>
<p>I also spent some time playing around with the <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame">nflgame</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zachpanz88/mlbgame">mlbgame</a> Python modules. I need to spend some more time with them and I’ll share some thoughts on those in another blog post.</p>

            <description>I’ve completed the Python For Everybody course taught by Dr. Charles Severance at the University of Michigan on Coursera. All that’s left is the capstone project to put into practice what I’ve learned, but as I’m doing this to learn Python and not for the official certificate, I’m going to skip it. The course is taught in Python 2.7 and I want to shift to Python 3.x.
Python For Everybody was great.</description>

<p>I’ve completed the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Python For Everybody</a> course taught by Dr. Charles Severance at the University of Michigan on Coursera. All that’s left is the capstone project to put into practice what I’ve learned, but as I’m doing this to learn Python and not for the official certificate, I’m going to skip it. The course is taught in Python 2.7 and I want to shift to Python 3.x.</p>
<p>Python For Everybody was great. The pace and the exercises were perfect for the class. I wish I had realized sooner that there were additional exercises in the textbook that were not part of the required Coursera class. The fourth class, Python and Databases, was intense. The speed of the class was accelerated with teaching you SQL and how Python connects to databases (SQLlite specifically). The homework was much more simple in Python for Databases compared to the first three sessions. You usually had to only make some minor changes in the SQL syntax to complete the grade.</p>
<p>The two things I’m going to need to focus on to have success in building the two apps I want to build are dictionaries (from importing statistics via JSON) and databases. If I walked away from one thing from the Python for Databases class is that I’m going to need to spend some time with paper and pencil and plan my information architecture and database models if I’m going to be successful.</p>
<p>Next I’m going to start <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/python-language-jumpstart-building-10-apps">Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps</a> by Michael Kennedy of the Talk Python podcast. I supported the Kickstarter earlier this year and am excited now that I hope I have enough of a base understanding of Python to tackle this. This will be taught in Python 3.x (yay!) and I’m hoping now that I have that base knowledge, building these apps along with the tutorials included will give the practice I need to later build a real app. It’s also going to go into a little more detail than what I’ve learned so far on list comprehension (which makes my head hurt), BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and Classes.</p>
<p>I also supported Mr. Kennedy’s next Kickstarter, <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business">Python for Entrepreneurs</a>. This also has me excited as the second phase of building my fantasy sports app will be deploying it on the web. The description looks perfect for what I’ll need, in addition to learning the web framework Pyramid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You will learn to build and design your web app</strong></p>
<p><strong>This course will teach you how to build a data-driven web application in Python.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We will</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>**• Build our web app with the Pyramid web framework, &quot;the Python web framework that supports your decisions, by artisans for artisans.&quot;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>**</p>
<p>• <strong>Create and connect to our database using SQLAlchemy, the most popular data access layer in Python</strong></p>
<pre><code>**• Learn the core elements of web design including CSS and front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>**</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time to get to work.</p>

            <description>I’m flying along in the Coursera course Python for Everybody, from the University of Michigan taught by Dr. Charles Severance. I’ve completed the first two of four courses which give you an introduction to Python.
I’m now on the third course, Using Python to Access Web Data. This and the fourth course focused on databases, are the two key foundations for the web app I want to build. I just finished Chapter 12, which introduces the BeautifulSoup library for scraping web pages.</description>

<p>I’m flying along in the Coursera course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Python for Everybody</a>, from the University of Michigan taught by <a href="http://dr-chuck.com/">Dr. Charles Severance</a>. I’ve completed the first two of four courses which give you an introduction to Python.</p>
<p>I’m now on the third course, <a href="//www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data/home/welcome">Using Python to Access Web Data</a>. This and the fourth course focused on databases, are the two key foundations for the web app I want to build. I just finished Chapter 12, which introduces the <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup library</a> for scraping web pages. This is going to be huge – I’ll be able to scrape ESPN to find which MLB or NFL teams lead their divisions or leading in the wild card races.</p>
<p>Being on vacation this week, I’ve been able to complete a few chapters and am now a couple weeks ahead of schedule. I’m tempted to pause and see if I can take what I’ve learned with BeautifulSoup and actually write some small Python programs to actually scrape and print the results. It might be good practice to reinforce what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>The next two chapters are key as well. XML and then the one I’m most looking forward to: JSON. I’ve already signed up for a developer account with <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/">MySportsFeeds</a> and am receiving JSON data for player stats, teams and conference standings. I’ve spoken in the past with one of their lead developers and they don’t currently keep statistics for wildcard or playoff standings, so I’m going to need to use BeautifulSoup in my app to get those. I’ll also need to make a decision if I’m going to use that JSON data for player stats and query against it myself or just use the <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame">nflgame</a> or <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb">nfldb</a> libraries that have already been built. The biggest challenge their is that both of those libraries are written in Python 2.7 and I really want to write my apps in Python 3.x.</p>
<p>I know I’m getting ahead of myself. Every time I learn something that will be applicable to the app I want to build and I talk to my wife about it, she tells me to slow down. My mind is always racing with how I can apply what I’m learning and how it will affect the architecture of the app. Some people say the best way to learn a programming language is to build something and learn as you go. I can’t wait to put all this Python learning to practice.</p>

            <description>tl;dr: I’m spending the time to learn Python primarily using the free course available at Coursera taught by Dr. Charles Severance of the University of Michigan and am really enjoying it.
The good news: I’ve committed to my goal of learning Python and I’m sticking to it.
The bad news: I haven’t been writing about my progress as much as I should be. Hey, learning this stuff is hard and takes time.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>tl;dr: I’m spending the time to learn Python primarily using the free course available at Coursera taught by Dr. Charles Severance of the University of Michigan and am really enjoying it.</em></p>
<p>The good news: I’ve committed to my goal of learning Python and I’m sticking to it.</p>
<p>The bad news: I haven’t been writing about my progress as much as I should be. Hey, learning this stuff is hard and takes time. That’s my excuse and I’m sticking to it.</p>
<p>As I <a href="http://paulcutler.org/blog/2016/07/how-time-flies-or-why-i-still-havent-learned-python/">mentioned in my last post</a>, I re-enrolled in the Coursera course, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Learn to Program and Analyze Data with Python</a>, from the University of Michigan taught by Dr. Charles Severance. It includes five courses, with each one lasting about six weeks, with the last course being a capstone project. You can audit the course for free or pay for an official certificate and I’m auditing the course.</p>
<p>I flew through the first course and am now 60% of the way through the second course, Python Data Structures. In the first course you learn the basics of computer science and Python – print statements, expressions and variables, loops and functions.</p>
<p>In the second course, Python Data Structures, you continue to build on that, learning how to slice slice strings, searching within strings, and working with files. This is where it is finally coming together and you’re writing a real program for homework assignments.</p>
<p>I am enjoying Learn to Program and Analyze Data with Python on Coursera. I find the professor’s video lectures easy to follow and understand. The conversational tone is helpful and I appreciate how he talks about a concept and also shows slides in the video that he draws on to help illustrate his point. I believe this helps those who learn by listening and those who learn visually.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the second course’s syllabus for week three that I just completed. As you start the week, you easily get an overview of the week ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lecture videos you will need to watch and how long they are</li>
<li>A wiki page of notes related to the lecture created by students</li>
<li>The assignments you will need to complete</li>
<li>A video showing the worked exercises to watch after the assignment is completed</li>
<li>Bonus (optional) material for the week</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There are two downsides to the course. The first is that it is being taught in Python 2.7. One of the best parts, though, is that Dr. Severance has made the course and the book available in a Creative Commons license, which is awesome. You don’t necessarily need to do it on Coursera as the course materials are available on his website at <a href="https://www.pythonlearn.com">Python Learn</a> with the videos also available on YouTube. If you visit the site, you’ll see the book has been rewritten for Python 3 and the materials are now being updated and I’m hopeful that the course on Coursera will be updated in time as well.</p>
<p>The second downside is more of a personal thing. The course has a neat autograder online:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>As you can see in the screenshot in the upper left, it tells you what to do to complete the assignment. Just below that is the editor that gives you some code to start. You edit the code and press “<em>Check Code</em>” and the output is displayed in the upper right box. If the output matches the assignment, the grade is automatically updated on the server.</p>
<p>I learned in this week’s assignment that I need to write my code in an editor and save it rather than just doing it in the browser. I had to go back and re-watch the worked exercises for the previous chapter to review the code from the last homework assignment as this week’s homework built upon it. I won’t make that mistake again! Also, if you are really stuck with a homework assignment, there is a discussion forum where you can ask questions and get hints to what to focus on to complete the assignment.</p>
<p>As I’ve worked through a couple of the books I’ve bought and proceed through this course, putting the concepts into practice is the hardest part. While I understand the concepts, or at least think I do, putting it into practice and writing a real program is where I struggle. As frustrating as it can be to go back, re-read a chapter or re-watch a video when I can’t write the code, I firmly believe I am going to learn best by practicing writing actual code over and over again if I ever want to meet my goal of writing the program to calculate the <a href="http://mlbpool2.com/standings/2015-nfl-pool-standings/">fantasy pool scores</a>. I am finally making the time commitment to learn Python and enjoying the process thanks to Dr. Chuck and Coursera.

            <description>A constant staple of this blog’s life over the last 10-plus years have been the constant breaks and then the “I haven’t blogged in forever!” blog posts. And here we are again.
After starting my journey to learn to program, I went a couple of months and then we sold the house and moved. That really did occupy a large chunk of time, but then all the usual excuses set in.</description>

<p>After starting my journey to learn to program, I went a couple of months and then we sold the house and moved. That really did occupy a large chunk of time, but then all the usual excuses set in. I’ve been telling myself the last couple of months I would start and never do.  Now we are just six weeks away from the football season and if I don’t learn Python, I can never build the application I want to automate the scoring of my football pool.</p>
<p>Nothing like the NFL season starting to get you motivated. I’ve re-enrolled in <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)</a> at Coursera and have decided to use Python 3.x over Python 2.x. I’m also going to work my way through <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920045267.do">Think Python (2nd Edition) by Allen B. Downey</a>, which also focuses on Python 3. I have a few ideas for what I’ll do next, but I need to do it one step at a time.</p>
<p>I’ve also been doing more research on how I’m going to pull the NFL stats in, but more on that later. I’m just happy to be motivated again!</p>

            <description>Prince has always held a special place for me. I spent my summers growing up with grandparents, an hour north of the suburbs of Milwaukee, where I lived. In 1984 I was 11 and I still remember walking to the record shop to purchase my first record, Prince’s Purple Rain. Years later, I would joke that if my grandparents or parents knew of some of the lyrics on that album, I would never have been able to buy it.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Prince has always held a special place for me. I spent my summers growing up with grandparents, an hour north of the suburbs of Milwaukee, where I lived. In 1984 I was 11 and I still remember walking to the record shop to purchase my first record, Prince’s <em>Purple Rain</em>. Years later, I would joke that if my grandparents or parents knew of some of the lyrics on that album, I would never have been able to buy it.</p>
<h3 id="darling-nikki">Darling Nikki</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I knew a girl named Nikki</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess you could say she was a sex fiend</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I met her in a hotel lobby</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Masturbating with a magazine</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She said how’d you like to waste some time</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Growing up in the golden age of MTV, my fandom would continue. <em>Raspberry Beret</em> continues to be one of my top ten songs of Prince. <em>U Got the Look</em>, his collaboration with Sheena Easton, will always be emblazoned in my mind from the video. In 1989, when the first Batman movie was released starring Michael Keaton, Prince’s <em>Batdance</em> was a sensation. There was nothing like it on pop radio. <em>Diamonds and Pearls</em> was released in October 1991, a month after I met my girlfriend and later wife. <em>The Love Symbol</em> album was released just a year later in October 1992 and both of these albums would feature singles that I would sprinkle through the mixtapes I made Kelly over this period.</p>
<p>I moved from Milwaukee to Madison in late 1992. I worked as a supervisor in a Best Buy store and Barb, a customer service rep, worked for me. If I had to guess, she was in her early 40s and worked Monday through Friday from 9-2. She knew I was a Prince fan and one day, out of the blue, she asked me if I wanted to join her and her husband on a trip up to Minneapolis. It turns out her son, Jamie, was a choreographer working for Prince’s new protege. Jamie didn’t have any formal dance training. Every day growing up, he would come home after school, turn on MTV and learn the dance moves to all the videos playing on MTV. Jamie would later go on to become one of the five touring dancers on Michael Jackson’s <em>Bad</em> tour.</p>
<p>I joined Barb and her husband on the trip to Minneapolis, my first time there. It was about a four to five hour drive. A local radio station was hosting there annual party called the <em>Star Party</em>. We had a VIP table close to the front where it was Jamie, Barb and her husband, and…. Carmen Electra. (I bet you didn’t remember that Carmen Electra started as a protege of Prince, did you?)</p>
<p>The Star Party was at Glam Slam, the club owned by Prince in downtown Minneapolis. Carmen Electra was slated to go on second to last and we sat at the table watching the other acts performed. Shortly before Carmen Electra was to go on stage, two huge bodyguards approached our table:</p>
<p><em>He is going to come to the table in a few minutes. You don’t look at him, you don’t talk to him. Understand?</em></p>
<p>And then he was there. You knew Prince was short but he was even smaller in person. He ignored all of us and whispered in Carmen Electra’s ear. She giggled, clearly enjoying the attention. And just like that, he was gone. A few minutes later Carmen would go backstage to get ready for her performance, of which I remember very little as it was forgettable. After the show, she came back, signed a record for me in lipstick, and kissed it. For years, as I moved apartment to apartment, cross country and back, I kept that sealed and signed record. At some point, I got rid of it. I kick myself on two fronts for that: first, the novelty; second, I would buy a turntable in 2008, and would have been able to actually listen to it.</p>
<p>After the show, we drove out to Chanhassen to drive by Paisley Park, before driving back to Madison. I only remember that I was very tired and it was a half hour drive to his studio through corn fields out in the suburbs. Who knew that in 1999 I would buy my first house just ten minutes from Paisley Park, where I still live to this day.</p>
<p>A few years later when watching the Oscars telecast, I noticed in the credits:</p>
<p><em>Choreographed by Jamie King</em></p>
<p>Hey, I met him!</p>
<p>A year or two later I would move to Minneapolis with my future wife. I was still working at Best Buy, and now so was she, in stores about ten minutes apart. There was a security guard who worked at both of our stores who also moonlighted as security at Paisley Park, where Prince would throw impromptu concerts from time to time. This security guard had a crush on Kelly and even asked her out. I didn’t hold this against him as he got me on the list for Paisley Park a few times.</p>
<p>Seeing Prince perform at Paisley Park is like nothing you’ve ever seen. He would rarely play any of his hits. Most times it was things stored in the vault or it was a one hour jam session with his band playing whatever he wanted. Whatever it was, it was magical and special and I’m so glad to have been one of the hundreds in attendance at those shows.</p>
<p>I would only be in Minneapolis for a year or two before moving for another promotion at Best Buy. Two albums would get me through the cross country drive. One was <em>The Hits</em>, a three album best of and a disc of B-sides, released in 1993. The other was ABBA’s <em>Thank You for the Music</em>, their four disc best of collection. (Don’t judge me).</p>
<p>In 1996 I was now a district operations manager for Best Buy in Philadelphia. <em>The Gold Experience</em>, released in September of ’95, was my constant companion in the car as I drove from store to store.</p>
<p>We would move back to Minneapolis in 1997 and in 1999 we bought our first house in Chaska, just ten minutes and one suburb over from Paisley Park, which we still drive by all the time.</p>
<p>In 2008, I would buy my first turntable. Searching through all of the record stores in Minneapolis, I was always on the lookout for Prince albums. Being in Minneapolis, Prince albums, with the exception of <em>Purple Rain</em>, were usually difficult to find and overpriced. But I would buy every one I could get my hands on.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>After years away in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, Prince returned to Minneapolis in a big way the last few years. He would throw more parties and concerts at Paisley Park. There was little notice given – usually a week to just a couple of days and you had to follow social media to find out. I would tell a co-worker who lived in Silicon Valley that he had to come out, as he really wanted to go to one of those shows. But buying a plane ticket on short notice? Ouch. You never knew if Prince was actually going to take the stage or not, and if he did, what time he would. Some of those first shows when he was back, doors would at 10 p.m. and he wouldn’t appear until 3, 4 or 5 a.m. I kept telling myself I would go back and never did.</p>
<p>Now I never will.</p>
<p>I drove out to Paisley Park mid-day yesterday after the announcement of Prince’s death. There were already hundreds gathered, grieving. The tributes along the Paisley Park fence were touching.</p>
<p>After the news broke, I was trying to explain to my oldest son what Prince met to me, and I broke down. 89.3 The Current played Prince non-stop starting in chronological order at 1 p.m. yesterday, and at 4 p.m. when <em>Purple Rain</em> hit the airwaves shortly after I got home from Paisley Park, I choked up again. Just writing this, tears come to my eye. Only one other artist’s death, Freddie Mercury in 1991, touched me in the way this has.</p>
<p>I’m so glad to call Minneapolis home. The impromptu concert last night on the streets of Minneapolis, as the city closed off blocks downtown surrounding the legendary First Avenue nightclub where <em>Purple Rain</em> was filmed, was awe inspiring as thousands filled the streets. First Avenue opened a dance party at 11 p.m., which was packed all night with people still waiting to get in at 3 a.m.</p>
<p>Prince called Minneapolis home, but he belonged to all of us, all over the world.</p>

            <description>Early last year I ran to Target on a Sunday morning on the spur of the moment. I wanted a Moleskin notebook, the small one that fits in your back pocket.
I wanted to get in a habit of writing down everything, especially ideas for writing prompts.
That lasted about a week for me. This is typical for me, especially when I try to create a new habit impulsively.
For the last couple of years, I’ve also been a huge fan of Wunderlist as a to-do application.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Early last year I ran to Target on a Sunday morning on the spur of the moment. I wanted a Moleskin notebook, the small one that fits in your back pocket.</p>
<p>I wanted to get in a habit of writing down everything, especially ideas for writing prompts.</p>
<p>That lasted about a week for me. This is typical for me, especially when I try to create a new habit impulsively.</p>
<p>For the last couple of years, I’ve also been a huge fan of <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com">Wunderlist</a> as a to-do application. It has great app support, working on the web, Mac, Android and iOS with instant sync. I had a number of lists and sub-lists within those and would capture all of the to-do items for each category.</p>
<p>It even worked great when we were selling the house late last year. My wife installed the apps and we shared a to-do list by room for everything that had to get done in order to sell the house. This was a big deal as she is a big fan of writing everything down and gets great pleasure in physically crossing off each action item.</p>
<p>The challenge I have is that I use Wunderlist in fits and spurts. I don’t capture everything I want to do as it happens. When I’m on top of my game, I’ll do two things. At the beginning of each week, I’ll first review all of my lists and the action items in them. I’ll update and check off anything that is done and I’ll add everything I want to get done. Each morning after that, I’ll sit down and review the lists, making sure to add anything I want to get done that day. The challenge I had is there were some days where I’d have the Mac app open and check things off as I would get things done. But I lacked discipline and wouldn’t do it every day and then weeks would go by and I’d have to start over. The bigger challenge for me was that I wasn’t adding things to my to-do list during the day. I was using it as a tool to get things done that I had already planned.</p>
<p>I’ve always been a big fan of <em>Getting Things Done</em> by David Allen. I read the book years ago and I took away three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>As soon as the idea hits you, write it down. Keep your mind uncluttered.</li>
<li>If it takes less than five minutes, write it down and <strong>then just do it.</strong></li>
<li>Create a tickler file aka a long term file for things you want to get done in the <strong>someday</strong> pile. But write it down and get it out of your head.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s why Wunderlist wasn’t working for me – I wasn’t reaching for the Mac app or my phone the moment something hit me that I needed or wanted to do. I don’t always have my phone on me. I don’t take it to meetings when I’m in the office and if I’m at my home office, I’ll leave it there when I go to the kitchen or if I go for a walk. If I think of something at a particular moment, I’m not writing it down right then and there.</p>
<p>So now I’m going old school. I grabbed the small Moleskin notebook I had abandoned and over the last couple of weeks, I’m filling it as fast I think of something that I want to do or needs to be done.</p>
<p>I have also added two tabs to my notebook. The first 70% of the notebook will be dedicated to my to-do list (and crossing them off!). I then have a tab for “Big Projects”, things that aren’t going to be done on a specific day. It needs to be more than a “someday” list, but I haven’t figured it out yet. Then there is a third tab, a “notes” tab. This tab is for anything I want to capture – ideas that I might want to write about; story ideas; or just random thoughts. Anything goes.</p>
<p>I think my wife might be on to something – the mental pleasure you get by crossing something off. Wunderlist makes a nice little ding when you check something as done and then archives it, making it disappear. Having the ability to see a page of things that have been done and crossed off makes you <strong>feel</strong> more productive. (Though there is an advanced feature in Wunderlist to make them not disappear, it would quickly be cluttered).</p>
<p>Like any productivity tip or tool, it’s about what works for you – and then sticking with it. I’m finding that <strong>not</strong> using technology for the first time in a long time is making me even more productive.</p>

            <description>My plan to learn Python was temporarily derailed by buying a new house, selling the old one, and moving. Fear not, we’re moved in, broadband was finally installed two days ago, and I’ll be back on plan next week.
In my quest to learn Python, I came across the Talk Python to Me podcast. I’ve listened to a handful of episodes and enjoyed them, even if most of them are over my head at this point.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My plan to learn Python was temporarily derailed by buying a new house, selling the old one, and moving.  Fear not, we’re moved in, broadband was finally installed two days ago, and I’ll be back on plan next week.</p>
<p>In my quest to learn Python, I came across the <a href="https://talkpython.fm">Talk Python to Me podcast</a>.  I’ve listened to a handful of episodes and enjoyed them, even if most of them are over my head at this point.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.michaelckennedy.net">Michael Kennedy</a>, the host of the show, launched a Kickstarter this week:  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikeckennedy/python-jumpstart-by-building-10-apps-video-course">Python Jumpstart by building 10 apps</a>.  This looks absolutely perfect for me as I’ve started learning Python from a couple of online courses and books and struggled in linear learning without context.  From the Kickstarter page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most courses focus on teaching you hundreds of details and leave putting them together as an exercise for the student. My course is different.</p>
<p>You will learn all the basics, yes. But you will learn them while building 10 stand alone applications. You will see each application built from the ground up in live demos. When we hit new topics (functions for example), we will pause, discuss them, and return to our application we are building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like it may fix or address where I’ve struggled in trying to learn from books.  While the Kickstarter does say it is for people who have some programming / scripting experience, I’m hoping by the time the course if available I’ll have a basic enough understanding of Python that this will jumpstart my Python knowledge.  (Pun intended).</p>
<p>I’m happy to see that after just a few days, its reached a couple of stretch goals.  I’ve pledged at the Early Access Student access.  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikeckennedy/python-jumpstart-by-building-10-apps-video-course">Check it out</a>!</p>

            <description>(Originally written in Day One on November 30th, 2015)
When Apple introduced iBooks into Mac OS X a couple of releases ago, I thought it was a dumb idea. Reading eBooks was meant to be done on an e-ink reader, such as a Kindle, or worst case, an iPad or tablet with an LCD screen. Who would want to read books on their actual computer?
It turns out, me. This may be big when it comes to learning Python.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>(Originally written in <a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> on November 30th, 2015)</em></p>
<p>When Apple introduced iBooks into Mac OS X a couple of releases ago, I thought it was a dumb idea.  Reading eBooks was meant to be done on an e-ink reader, such as a Kindle, or worst case, an iPad or tablet with an LCD screen.  Who would want to read books on their actual computer?</p>
<p>It turns out, me.  This may be big when it comes to learning Python.  Oh, and having a 27” iMac doesn’t hurt, either.</p>
<p>On the left, are the iBooks I have imported.  (Big thanks to O’Reilly for making their ebooks purchases DRM free and available as ePub, Kindle format, PDF and another format of which I can’t remember).</p>
<p>On the right is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a>, the text editor from the folks who brought you <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>.  I’ve just installed it as it is a little more lightweight than <a href="https://panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>, typically my text editor / IDE of choice on a Mac.</p>
<p>After reviewing the three Python books I bought, I’m starting with <em><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920045267.do">Think Python</a></em>.  Originally known as <em>“How to Think Like a Computer Scientist”</em> and written for Java, I chose this one, because, as the author puts in in the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.</p>
<p>One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.</p>
<p>Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize jargon and define each term at first use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult topics and split them into a series of small steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Excerpt From: Allen B. Downey. “Think Python.” iBooks.</em></p>
<p>What I took away is he wanted to help students learn the basics of programming and computer science, not just the language.  That’s what I need as I don’t have any background in the building blocks of programming.  So even though the book is geared towards Python 3.x and I’m using Python 2.7 on my Mac and my CentOS server, I’m going to start with this book.</p>
<p>What’s great about doing this in iBooks side by side with my text editor and a terminal, is that when it comes time to do the exercises in the book, I can make a note right in iBooks.  I highlight the exercise and click “Add Note”.  I then paste in from a terminal the Python code from the exercise and the results.  If I get it wrong, I’ll paste both the wrong and right code and make a note of how I fixed it.  This should make review a lot easier.</p>
<p>Today’s focus was on math operations (and not using the math module built in to Python).  Lots of parentheses and learning the order of operation.  I also learned the hard way the difference between integers and floating point numbers as part of the exercises.</p>

            <description>As I attempt to learn Python, I’m fascinated by how people are able to do this as well as how they started to learn to program.
I’m not the only one, as Ryan Gordon (aka Icculus), a well known game developer who ports many games to Linux and Mac, asked a similar question on Twitter last month.
This led to a lot of interesting tweets and Ryan created a Storify page to share them.</description>

<p>I’m not the only one, as Ryan Gordon (aka <a href="http://www.icculus.org/~icculus">Icculus</a>), a well known game developer who ports many games to Linux and Mac, asked a similar question on Twitter last month.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This led to a lot of interesting tweets and Ryan <a href="https://storify.com/icculus/how-i-got-started-programming-stories">created a Storify page to share them</a>. Josh “Cheeseness” Bush <a href="http://cheesetalks.net/first_coding_exp.php">wrote up a great analysis</a> of those tweets sharing graphs looking at the languages, hardware and more about the people who replied used to get started with programming.</p>
<p>Even though I’m just starting to formally learn to code now, my story with computers is similar to a lot of those stories.</p>
<p>It all started in the early 80s when my father bought a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair">Timex Sinclair TS1000</a> (aka ZX81) and then a TS1500.  You could load games via tape and also buy magazines with the code to program your own games.  I spent hours handtyping machine code to create games like Breakout.</p>
<p>A few years later my father bought an Apple //c and I then learned Logo, Basic and others.  Nothing that I ever really stuck with from a programming stand point, but enough to learn the basics and spend hours tinkering.</p>
<p>After that, my father bought a an IBM clone 286.  I remember being at Sears with him and telling him to spend the extra money to get a 386, but even a 286 was at least $2,000 back then.  I remember it ran GeOS for a graphical interface and one Christmas, after I received the original Wing Comannder as a gift, I had to buy MS-DOS 5 just so I could use the himem.sys to have enough memory to run the game.</p>
<p>From the Apple //c on, we always had a modem as well.  Starting with a 300 baud modem to a 1200 baud modem later, I started visiting BBSes on the Apple //c and later on the IBM clone as well.  (We had a Compuserve account early on, but hourly charges!  Ouch.) As a teenager I would go to meetups and actually meet the people I was interacting with on a BBS in a real life – something I’d do twenty years later when I got involved in open source and <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>.</p>
<p>Using Linux for years and being involved with GNOME, taught me how to use a shell, basic XML with Docbook, and revision control with Git.  But now it’s time to learn a formal language and make my first program.</p>
<p>In many ways, I still consider myself an early adopter and if it weren’t having access to computers at a young age, both in home and in school, I’d be a much different person today.</p>

            <description>(Orginally written in Day One on November 30th, 2015)
I’ve decided to learn Python.
Not only do I have an itch to scratch, but I need a hobby (as I’ve said many times over the last few years since leaving the open source world.)
Python is supposedly one of the easier languages to learn as a complete beginner. It also is supposed to be good at web scraping, which fulfills a specific need I have.</description>

<p>I’ve decided to learn Python.</p>
<p>Not only do I have an itch to scratch, but I need a hobby (as I’ve said many times over the last few years since leaving the open source world.)</p>
<p>Python is supposedly one of the easier languages to learn as a complete beginner. It also is supposed to be good at web scraping, which fulfills a specific need I have.</p>
<p>I started the Codeacademy class for Python last week over the Thanksgiving holiday. I was about 15% of the way through it and then got hung up on Boolean operators. Not only did I find them confusing, but I have an issue with the way Codeacademy structured that chapter. They basically had you copy and paste the code into their editor, which for me, didn’t teach me anything. When it came time to do the quiz, I was hopelessly lost. After swearing about that for a few hours and taking a break, my subconscious kicked in and started thinking about it. I then realized that the Boolean operators are going to be exactly what I need to define if a player’s pick is a unique choice in our pool and to double the points for that particular pick.</p>
<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>In 2013, my friend Stone and I resurrected MLBPool, with the creative name of MLBPool2. This was a baseball pool he had been in for ten years that came to an end in 2011. You pick which teams will win and lose their division, individual leaders in hitting and pitching categories and that’s it. You earn double points if your pick is unique and no one else chose that team or person for that category. You can change your picks at the All-Star break, but those changes are only worth half points. That’s it – no daily lineups like fantasy. I call it <em>fantasy sports for the lazy</em>. Which is perfect for me.</p>
<p>This year we also started an NFL version, which I’m managing. It’s identical except there is no changing your picks at the half way point. I <a href="http://mlbpool2.com">manage the website for both at MLBPool2.com</a>.</p>
<p>Every Tuesday morning I have to manually update the Google Sheet. The original MLBPool site was written in ASP and was doing web scraping to update the leaders. I have to believe there is a way to do that again and I’m hoping Python is the answer.</p>
<p>O’Reilly had a 60% sale over Black Friday, so I bought four books:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing Python</li>
<li>Learning Python</li>
<li>Think Python</li>
<li>Python Pocket Reference</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m all in.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge is that there are two versions of Python: 2.7 and 3.5. 2.7 is legacy and 3.x is the future. I even emailed an old friend that I haven’t talked to in a few years that I know uses Python. (I’m terrible about staying in contact with people, but that’s a different story for another day). My CentOS server on Digital Ocean runs 2.7, as does my Mac. He also recommended I start with 2.7. But of course the books are focused on the latest and greatest. I’m hoping I don’t get too confused and can write clean code that works in both, but we’ll see. Worst case scenario is I learn 3.x code from the books and have to upgrade the server, but we all know how that usually turns out…</p>
<p>I need a hobby. I’m hoping I can stick with this. Even writing in my journal isn’t something I’ve stuck with for as long as I’ve liked, but I have to give it a go. I’m hoping by the 2017 season I’ll have a beta that’s working, so I have a year and a half.</p>
<p>With the updates to Day One, maybe I should start a Python journal to document how it’s going. (Update: I have started a new journal in Day One called <em>Python</em>. I may even start blogging my adventures in Python on my personal blog or via DayOne.me).</p>
<p><em>January 6th, 2016: And, look! I even started blogging my adventures!</em></p>

            <description>* Dusts off the old blog *
This thing still on? Still working? I guess it is! I could give you the usual excuses why I haven’t blogged much in the last few years. The rise of Twitter, general laziness, etc. But I might be back to blogging for a little bit.
I won’t call it a New Year’s resolution as I started it at Thanksgiving, but 2016 is the year I’m going to learn how to code.</description>

<p>This thing still on?  Still working?  I guess it is!  I could give you the usual excuses why I haven’t blogged much in the last few years.  The rise of Twitter, general laziness, etc.  But I might be back to blogging for a little bit.</p>
<p>I won’t call it a New Year’s resolution as I started it at Thanksgiving, but 2016 is the year I’m going to learn how to code.  Specifically, I’m going to learn Python.  I have an itch to scratch and a problem to solve and Python may be the solution.</p>
<p>I’ve worked with programmers both at my day job and various <a href="http://www.gnome.org">open source organizations</a>, but I don’t know how to code.  I can manipulate a little HTML and XML (Docbook), but that doesn’t mean I could do it from scratch.</p>
<p>Just over a month ago on Thanksgiving weekend, I decided it was time to learn Python.  I bought a few books from <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com">O’Reilly</a> that were on sale, started a <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> course, and away I went.</p>
<p>One reason that I may not blog as much, is that I do use a journal – <a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a>, specifically (and it’s fantastic, but that’s a different subject for another day) as I do enjoy writing.  At the same time I decided to start to learn to code, I started a new notebook in Day One (sshhh – it’s a secret new feature available to beta testers I’m not supposed to talk about…yet) to start detailing my journey into learning Python.</p>
<p>In the coming days, weeks, and hopefully, months I’ll be sharing those thoughts from my journal on trying to learn Python, including why, what’s working, not working and the tools I’m using.  Stay tuned for more as I begin my quest to learn Python.</p>

            <description>Since I was a kid, I’ve been a fan of Berke Breathed’s Bloom County. Over a dozen years ago while on vacation in San Francisco, I visited a number of used bookstores and completed my Bloom County book collection. I own every Bloom County book published, including the collections and the Library series. I even bought the Humble Bundle a year or two ago to re-purchase everything digitally so I can view it on my iPad.</description>

I own every Bloom County book published, including the collections and the Library series. I even bought the Humble Bundle a year or two ago to re-purchase everything digitally so I can view it on my iPad.</p>
<p>So when Mr. Breathed brought Milo, Opus, Steve Dallas and the rest of the gang earlier this year as <a href="http://www.berkeleybreathed.com">Bloom County 2015</a> I was through the moon. I took a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/19480231470/in/photolist-vFph8Q-iJmVvd-7VwuVH">picture of my stuffed Opus with a collection of my books</a> and tweeted out my excitement.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A couple months after re-launching the comic strip, a store was launched to buy signed copies of the daily strips, merchandise and more. A daily strip costs $110 and a Sunday strip in color costs $150. It’s a steep price, but each strip is signed and Breathed also personally draws a pencil sketch of the character of your choice on the strip.</p>
<p>One of last week’s strips sealed the deal for me and I pulled the trigger and bought it today. <a href="http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/signed-strips-store/76-trailer">Bloom County 2015 #76</a> features Cutter John trying to avoid the Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer due to spoilers. Bloom County and a Star Wars reference together? These are two of my favorite things! Like Cutter John, I had successfully avoid Star Wars spoilers for the new movie… until the trailer came out and I read a scene by scene breakdown of the trailer with all the spoilers.</p>
<p>It will be a month before my personalized comic strip arrives. This will be a perfect addition to my new office in the new house.</p>

            <description>As a transplant to Minnesota from Wisconsin, I’ve now spent over half my life here. I’m a cheesehead through and through, but if there is one thing that Minnesota has that Wisconsin has never had, it’s the music. The first album I ever bought was Prince’s Purple Rain and my first ever trip to Minnesota I actually met Prince, which is another story for a different time. A few years later I was living here and I won tickets on Rev105 to a local music showcase at First Avenue.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a transplant to Minnesota from Wisconsin, I’ve now spent over half my life here. I’m a cheesehead through and through, but if there is one thing that Minnesota has that Wisconsin has never had, it’s the music. The first album I ever bought was Prince’s <em>Purple Rain</em> and my first ever trip to Minnesota I actually met Prince, which is another story for a different time. A few years later I was living here and I won tickets on <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?s=rev105&amp;submit=Search">Rev105</a> to a local music showcase at <a href="http://www.first-avenue.com">First Avenue</a>. There I was introduced to Zuzu’s Petals and the headliner, a band called Pleasure, which would later be known as Semisonic.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks I’ve been treated to both the stars of the current local scene and the past. First up, was <a href="http://blog.thecurrent.org/2014/08/photos-mn-music-on-a-stick-2014/">Minnesota Music on a Stick</a> at the State Fair Grandstand hosted by <a href="http://www.thecurrent.org">The Current</a>. Featuring country favorites The Cactus Blossoms, the indescribable Har Mar Superstar, Cloud Cult, punk legend Bob Mould, hip hop collective Doomtree, and the rapper Brother Ali, only The Current could bring together such a diverse group for one show.</p>
<p>I brought Zoe to the show for her first rock concert. She was surprised how loud it was, but we got up close and personal for Har Mar Superstar’s set and Doomtree. She’s more into pop music, but she listened to all of the artists before we came and Doomtree was her favorite. It being her first concert, we had to buy her a concert t-shirt.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If I had to pick one, I was there for Bob Mould first, with Har Mar Superstar and Doomtree being close behind him, not to mention Cloud Cult. We sat in the bleachers for Cloud Cult and Bob Mould, which was probably the right call considering how loud Bob Mould can get. Twenty songs in 60 minutes? No problem for Mr. Mould and his rockstar band. It’s the second time I’ve seen him in the last couple of years, and he’s not one for a lot of chatter during his show, which is just fine as he played a great selection of songs from Hüsker Dü, Sugar and his solo material. Sitting in the bleachers, the program director for The Current, <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/about/people/mpr_people_display.php?aut_id=30437">Jim McGuinn</a>, was in the row across from us, and as we left the bleachers to down to see Doomtree, I had to thank him for how much I value The Current. (I would see him again at The Replacements, but I don’t want him to think I’m some kind of crazy stalker).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Har Mar Superstar’s stage presence is amazing and he brought rising star Lizzo along for the entire set. I’m pretty tempted to get tickets to his upcoming show at First Avenue. Volunteering at The Current almost ten years ago for an afternoon, they gave me a few CDs to go home with, one of which was Har Mar Superstar, and I’ve been a fan since. I shouldn’t have been surprised, but most of the people there only seemed to know of his last album, the soul music throwback <em>Bye Bye 17</em>. When <em>Almond Joy</em> and <em>Tall Boy</em> should have had the crowd moving, it seemed as if only 30% of the crowd knew of his classic dance songs.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We went down into the crowd for Doomtree and tried to find a spot where Zoe could see over all the adults. I’ve been a fan of P.O.S. for ten years and Dessa for the last few years, so it was quite a treat to see them all together. I was pleasantly surprised how almost all of them each also did a song from their solo repertoire, with the highlight easily being Dessa’s <em>Warsaw</em> for me personally.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And this past Saturday was The Replacements. I don’t know what I can say <a href="http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/music/275038201.html">that</a> <a href="http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/music/275024531.html">hasn’t</a> <a href="http://blog.thecurrent.org/2014/09/the-replacements-finally-bring-it-back-home-for-crowd-pleasing-midway-stadium-show/">already</a> <a href="http://blog.thecurrent.org/2014/09/my-first-replacements-show-what-i-learned-about-a-band-ive-always-loved/">been</a> <a href="http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2014/09/the_replacements_at_midway_stadium_91314.php">said</a>, but it was just amazing. As a teenager, the Say Anything soundtrack introduced me to so many bands, and The Replacements were one of them. <em>Within Your Reach</em> may be one of their slowest songs and it was quite the pleasant surprise to buy one of their albums at age 16 and find out they were a punk band. I quickly fell in love. Out of the all concerts I’ve been to in my life, it has to be in my top ten. They played almost everything they could in their first homecoming in 23 years. Seeing The Hold Steady open for them was just a bonus, but Saturday night was all about The Replacements. A sold out show to 14,000 or so fans, a few years from now I think 50,000 people will claim they were there that night.</p>

            <description>I took the kids to Captain America: The Winter Soldier this past Sunday. You know it’s going to be a blockbuster when the theater is 75% filled at a 9:30 a.m. showing on a Sunday morning. I usually like to take the kids to the early showing as the theater is almost empty on Sunday mornings.
Warning: Minor Spoiler
Two thirds of the way through the movie, Natasha Romanova (Black Widow), played by Scarlett Johansson, and Steve Rogers (Captain America), played by Chris Evans, enter an abandoned military base with an ancient mainframe computer system.</description>

<p><em><strong>Warning: Minor Spoiler</strong></em></p>
<p>Two thirds of the way through the movie, Natasha Romanova (Black Widow), played by Scarlett Johansson, and Steve Rogers (Captain America), played by Chris Evans, enter an abandoned military base with an ancient mainframe computer system. Natasha Romanova turns to Captain America, and asks in a monotone, “<em>Would you like to play a game?</em>” Right out of the 1983 movie <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">WarGames</a></em>. Zoe turns to me in the theater, her face all lit up, as she gets the in-joke, mostly in there for my generation.</p>
<p>We had just watched <em>Wargames</em> a couple months ago on Netflix, right before it was set to expire. (Alas, it’s still expired and not available for streaming.)</p>
<p>That was definitely a warm fuzzy knowing I’ve contributed to my kids geek credibility. Achievement Unlocked.</p>

            <description>Winter never ends. I just returned home from 10 days in Asia, with a weekend stopover in Japan, staying in Osaka with a day trip to Kyoto.
It’s cold, snowing and blustery in Minneapolis on April 1st, so here’s a photo of a cherry tree just starting to blossom in Kyoto, Japan. We were a week or two early to enjoy the full cherry trees coming in to blossom, but there were a few just starting.</description>

            <description>Congratulations to the University of Wisconsin’s Men’s Basketball team on their victory over Arizona to win the West Regional bracket and advance to the Final Four.
Tom Oates of the Wisconsin State Journal has an excellent article on what this means for Coach Bo Ryan.
The game was a nail biter, with the last 18 minutes of regulation being a one possession game before finally going into overtime and the Badgers pulling out a huge win.</description>

            <description>40 years of using your imagination. Ethan Gilsdorf has a fantastic essay up on Boing Boing: At 40 Years Old, Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Still Matters. As the original Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons turns 40 this year, I’m guessing we’ll see many great tributes to the grandaddy of all role playing games, and Mr. Gilsdorf’s essay really resonated with me.
 Along the way, D&amp;amp;Ders like me learned about stuff. We discussed hit dice and saving throws, ballistas and halberds.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="subtitle" id="40-years-of-using-your-imagination">40 years of using your imagination.</h2>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/author/ethan_gilsdorf_1">Ethan Gilsdorf</a> has a fantastic essay up on Boing Boing: <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/01/31/at-40-years-old-dungeons-dr.html">At 40 Years Old, Dungeons &amp; Dragons Still Matters</a>. As the original <a href="http://www.wizards.com/Dnd/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> turns 40 this year, I’m guessing we’ll see many great tributes to the grandaddy of all role playing games, and Mr. Gilsdorf’s essay really resonated with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Along the way, D&amp;Ders like me learned about stuff. We discussed hit dice and saving throws, ballistas and halberds. We studied, without encouragement from our parents or teachers, arcane subjects such as architecture, history, languages, and statistics. I learned how to draw and map. I learned battle tactics, how to bargain, how to empathize and negotiate with those not like me—be it undead kings or jocks. And a lot of introverted, socially-inept kids found friends and fellowship. I got socialized, and I learned how to be a leader. Bored and dissatisfied with my real life, I created a more exciting one, again and again, where I got to save the day and have agency.</p>
<p>The tools of D&amp;D gave me permission to imagine a better me, and a better story for myself. They gave me the courage to imagine a different future. And taught me how to change myself. Not happy with lowly Level 1 Ethan, I worked hard to level up to my better, stronger, faster level 17 version today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the key to role playing and I learned similar things playing D&amp;D in the ’80s. I <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/2011/10/rpgkids/">introduced my two youngest children to role-playing</a> with <a href="http://newbiedm.com/rpgkids/">rpgKids</a> a couple years ago and this year we’re transitioning to <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/products/beginnerbox">Pathfinder</a>. I’m hopeful they will learn the same things using their imagination to role play, and it helps to unplug them from their screens as well as challenge them mentally while encouraging them physically with the athletics they are involved with. Balance is good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>D&amp;D is still my springboard into dreaming. Me and four other guys, all in our forties, embark upon these imaginary adventures on Sunday nights. How can I give this up? I leave my computer behind and dip into an amorphous, enigmatic current of magical thinking that humans rarely swim in: something epic and unknown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had the chance recently to re-connect with a friend from high school whom I haven’t talked to (or anyone from that period of my life) in over 20 years. He still plays D&amp;D regularly with other friends from high school, including the one who introduced me to D&amp;D. I find that I’m jealous of that; both the camaraderie of friends staying connected like that and the discipline of having a weekly gaming group with the chance, as Mr. Gilsdorf says, “[to] <em>leave my computer behind and dip into an amorphous, enigmatic current of magical thinking that humans rarely swim in…</em>” My oldest son regularly plays Pathfinder (and Magic: The Gathering) with his group of high school buddies and I like to think I had something to do with that. I’ll continue to play with the two younger ones and I hope they learn the same things Mr. Gilsdorf and I learned from Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>

            <description>A few weeks ago I was out watching football with some buddies. I was talking about my new car and how I was disappointed it didn’t have Radio Data System built in, which shows you the song name and title when listening to the radio. “Who still listens to the radio?!” he said. I replied, “I listen to The Current! We have one of the best public radio stations in the country!</description>

<p>A few weeks ago I was out watching football with some buddies. I was talking about my new car and how I was disappointed it didn’t have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Data_System">Radio Data System</a> built in, which shows you the song name and title when listening to the radio. “Who still listens to the radio?!” he said. I replied, “I listen to <a href="http://www.thecurrent.org">The Current</a>! We have one of the best public radio stations in the country!” A week or so later, he forwarded me the Arbitron ratings locally to debunk my statement.</p>
<p>As The Current celebrates its ninth birthday, <a href="http://www.citypages.com/2014-01-22/music/89-3-the-current-an-oral-history/">City Pages has published an Oral History of The Current</a>. Featuring former and current employees of <a href="http://www.mpr.org">Minnesota Public Radio</a> and <a href="http://www.thecurrent.org">the station</a>, they talk about the founding of the station; the highs of getting it off the ground; the lows of the rating crash a few years later and bringing in a consultant; and the success they’ve had with both the station, supporting new artists and especially their support of the <a href="http://www.thecurrent.org/local">local music scene</a>. It’s a fantastic read and gives you a rare behind the scenes look at running a radio station.</p>
<p>And to my friend who wanted to argue with me about having one of the best radio stations in the country, the opening paragraphs back me up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, 89.3 the Current celebrates the start of its 10th year, having become the model for cutting-edge radio throughout the country. Not bad for a station built from the ground up in six weeks.</p>
<p>Before the Current hit the airwaves in January 2005, local FM radio was a dead zone, and 89.3 was home to string orchestras. Flash forward to today, and the Current has revitalized the local music scene and been named the country’s best non-commercial radio station by industry peers for four years running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happy 9th birthday, 89.3!</p>

            <title>Favorite Albums of 2013</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2014/01/favorite-albums-of-2013/</link>

With 2013 now in the books, I’d like to share some of my favorite albums of 2013. After Polica dropped their debut album digitally on December 20th, 2011, I’ve learned to wait until the year is over to share my favorite albums – don’t want to miss one!
These might not be the critic’s choices, but these are albums I like, and almost all of them I’ve bought on vinyl this year.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/11061236153/in/set-72157638067918784/player/]</p>
<p>With 2013 now in the books, I’d like to share some of my favorite albums of 2013. After Polica dropped their debut album digitally on December 20th, 2011, I’ve learned to wait until the year is over to share my favorite albums – don’t want to miss one!</p>
<p>These might not be the critic’s choices, but these are albums I like, and almost all of them I’ve bought on vinyl this year. In no particular order:</p>
<p><strong>Frank Turner</strong> – <em>Tape Deck Heart</em> – <a href="http://www.thecurrent.org">89.3 The Current</a> started spinning the second track from this album, <em>The Way I Tend to Be</em>, just a few months ago, and I fell in love. Giving the album a listen on Rdio, and then his back catalog, I realized how many of his songs I knew, without even knowing who the artist was. This is a fantastic album with catchy hooks and amazing lyrics. The only downside is the vinyl album didn’t come with an MP3 download card.</p>
<p><strong>Free Energy</strong> – <em>Love Signs</em> – As a child and fan of everything 80s (well, maybe except the fashion), I love the 80s style power pop of this album. It started the year out with a bang and this albums knows exactly what it is – unapologetic pure fun.</p>
<p><strong>The National</strong> – <em>Trouble Will Find Me</em> – I’ve always liked The National – and this album, along with their previous effort, really solidified for me how good they really are.</p>
<p><strong>Chvrches</strong> – <em>The Bones of What You Believe In</em> – This is arguably my favorite album of the year. I’m just kicking myself for not going to see them at First Avenue earlier this year. Chvrches brings back that 80s power synth sound and merges it with today’s indie movement. Fantastic debut album.</p>
<p><strong>Dessa</strong> – <em>Parts of Speech</em> – Local singer / songwriter / poet and member of the Doomtree collective. Good songwriting combined with her and Aby Wolf’s vocals made this a great album. The lead single, Warsaw, was nothing like she’s done as a solo artist and hit me like a hammer the first time I heard it. The Current did a special with her live at the Fitzgerald Theater, Dessa Deconstructed, which combined a live interview with Dessa mixed with a live performance. It’s available on YouTube and my favorite part was where she broke down the making of Warsaw.</p>
<p>[//www.youtube.com/embed/le0LS0RFEbM]</p>
<p><strong>Mikal Cronin</strong> – <em>MCII</em> – I took a gamble on this album as I’m a fan of most artists on the Merge label, and it quickly became a favorite of mine. I was quite happy to see this make a bunch of “Best of 2013” lists as it didn’t seem to have much buzz or airplay.</p>
<p><strong>Superchunk</strong> – <em>I Hate Music</em> – When I started running again early this summer, this was my go to album. If you’re a Superchunk fan, there’s not a lot new here, but it’s a short album at 40 minutes, and fast paced with a good beat. I’ve always liked Superchunk and this album doesn’t disappoint.</p>
<p><strong>Neko Case</strong> – <em>The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You</em> – Neko Case’s last album, <em>Middle Cyclone</em>, was the first vinyl album I bought when I got back into vinyl a few years ago, on clear vinyl on the second Record Store Day, no less. I’m a huge fan of the New Pornographers, of whom she is a member, and I’ve always enjoyed her solo work. It’s much more personal and raw, and this album is especially so as Ms. Case <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/23/neko-case-interview">has talked about her struggles leading up to this album as she was depressed and grieving the loss of her grandmother</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Volcano Choir</strong> – <em>Repave</em> – Is there anything Justin Vernon of Bon Iver does that doesn’t turn into gold? The second album he was a part of in 2013 (the first being the blues rock Shouting Matches), Repave is the second release by Volcano Choir and one in which he didn’t write any of the songs, but still retains a very Bon Iver feel. There’s not a lot I can say about this that <a href="http://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/09/16/album-review-volcano-choir-repave">Barb Abney of 89.3 The Current hasn’t already said</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Har Mar Superstar</strong> – <em>Bye Bye 17</em> – Six or seven years ago I was volunteering at MPR and they handed me a few CDs for helping out for an afternoon. One of them was of Har Mar Superstar, whom I hadn’t heard of at the time, but quickly learned to love. With the lead single, <em>Lady, You Shot Me</em>, Sean Tillman aka Har Mar Superstar takes us back to the old soul sound and it works.</p>
<p><strong>Caroline Smith</strong> – <em>Half About Being a Woman</em> – Another local Minnesota artist, Ms. Smith ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for her latest album of which I participated in. When the vinyl reward ran late ran late, she sent all of her vinyl backers a copy of the CD, which was a great touch as we had already received access to the MP3 download. Like Har Mar Superstar above, her album is a tribute to the classic Motown soul sound and after a few listens, you will forget that it came out in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Janelle Monae</strong> – <em>The Electric Lady</em> – this soulful, funky concept album has received rave reviews and not enough airplay. This is unlike most music out there and if you haven’t listened to it yet, go do it now.  It will make you dance.</p>

I vividly remember the day Rev105 changed formats. My wife and I were leaving work and climbed into the car in the carpool lot. Turning on the car, Van Halen was playing. I was surprised, but I’ve always been a Van Halen fan, and dug that they were playing it.

<p>I vividly remember the day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGVX">Rev105</a> changed formats. My wife and I were leaving work and climbed into the car in the carpool lot. Turning on the car, Van Halen was playing. I was surprised, but I’ve always been a Van Halen fan, and dug that they were playing it. Rev105 was the most eclectic radio station I’ve ever listened to, and while I was surprised to hear Van Halen, it wasn’t out of the norm from some of the things they played. And then another hard rock song came on, and another – and they announced the new call letters, X105. And just like that, my favorite radio station was dead.</p>
<p>The latest Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees were announced a week and a half ago. To celebrate, 89.3 The Current played a number of the inductees, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hall and Oates</li>
<li>Linda Rondstadt</li>
<li>Cat Stevens</li>
<li>Peter Gabriel</li>
</ul>
<p>Mary Lucia was driving to work when they played the above artists and missed Barb Abney’s introduction to the set list. <a href="http://blog.thecurrent.org/2013/12/the-day-the-current-almost-gave-mary-lucia-a-heart-attack/">Her reaction was hilarious</a>, along with the voicemail she left to Jill Riley, co-host of the morning show on The Current:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I FREAKED out! Not another format change! This isn’t happening again! I was convinced we had flipped formats overnight and this was my way of finding out I no longer had a job at the Current.</p>
<p>I know this sounds overly dramatic, but friends, this has happened to me before in my radio career: One day I have a job, and the next day we are playing Scorpions and Nazareth. BOOM! “Thanks for all of your hard work, now who needs a box to pack up your [stuff]?”</p>

<p>Kudos to The Current for sharing this – it brought a smile to my face.</p>

            <description>This year marks ten years of charitable giving for me to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The EFF is by far my favorite charity that we give to each year and I can’t stress enough how important the work they do is.
A number of years ago my wife framed my letters and stickers I’ve received from my favorite non-profit organizations (pictured above) including the EFF, Creative Commons and Minnesota Public Radio.</description>

<p>This year marks ten years of charitable giving for me to the <a href="http://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. The EFF is by far my favorite charity that we give to each year and I can’t stress enough how important the work they do is.</p>
<p>A number of years ago my wife framed my letters and stickers I’ve received from my favorite non-profit organizations (pictured above) including the <a href="http://www.eff.org">EFF</a>, <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> and <a href="http://www.mpr.org">Minnesota Public Radio</a>.</p>
<p>Who is the EFF and why is it important? From their <a href="https://www.eff.org/about">About page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When our freedoms in the networked world come under attack, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is the first line of defense. EFF broke new ground when it was founded in 1990—well before the Internet was on most people’s radar—and continues to confront cutting-edge issues defending free speech, privacy, innovation, and consumer rights today. From the beginning, EFF has championed the public interest in every critical battle affecting digital rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While most of America was shocked at Edward Snowden’s revelations this year about the NSA spying, EFF supporters have known about the NSA’s taps on the internet for years – it was in January, 2006 when Mark Klein became a whistle blower, sharing with the EFF information about the NSA internet taps at AT&amp;T. (<a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/timeline">The full timeline of NSA spying</a> is staggering).</p>
<p>This is just one of many important projects that EFF works on to protect our digital rights. <a href="https://www.eff.org/work">Check them out with the full list</a>:</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>

            <description>If you played Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons in the 80s, read the Dragonlance novels published by TSR or played Everquest, chances are you have seen artwork by Larry Elmore.
Just about a year ago Mr. Elmore launched a Kickstarter to publish most of his painted art from the last 40 years, and it was successfully funded on New Year’s Eve of 2012.
Imagine my surprise yesterday when the US Postal Service rang my doorbell and delivered my Kickstarter package.</description>

<p>If you played Dungeons &amp; Dragons in the 80s, read the Dragonlance novels published by TSR or played Everquest, chances are you have seen artwork by Larry Elmore.</p>
<p>Just about a year ago Mr. Elmore <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1488741362/larry-elmore-art-the-complete-elmore-artbook">launched a Kickstarter to publish most of his painted art</a> from the last 40 years, and it was successfully funded on New Year’s Eve of 2012.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise yesterday when the US Postal Service rang my doorbell and delivered my Kickstarter package. The Postal Service delivering on a Sunday?! (My wife is guessing that our local Post Office is running behind this year and may be working overtime to deliver on Sundays to catch up).</p>
<p>The book is absolutely gorgeous. Almost coffee table sized, I was expecting just his artwork, but it’s thankfully not. Filled with stories, remembrances, backgrounds on some of the paintings, and more.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/11388514563/" title="The Complete Elmore Kickstarter by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Also included were the stretch goals: a Black and White Sketchbook (pictured above) and a number of 8×10 reproductions of the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons box set and Dragonlance book covers (pictured below).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/11404420066/" title="The Complete Elmore Kickstarter Stretch Goals by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>I’ve only had a chance to briefly flip through the book, but I’m looking forward to spending some quality time going through it in more detail. This was $49 well spent and in his last Kickstarter update, Mr. Elmore has hinted at a future Kickstarter featuring a matching hardback of his black and white art:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am planning other Kickstarter Campaigns later on, some special books, like a NEW color Snarfquest graphic novel, and we are working on card games and board games, which I am greatly involved in. One of the most important projects, that may go up on Kickstarter next year, will be a large hardback black and white book. I wanted to get all my black and white work in this book, but there was no way…the book would be TOO thick. So, I want to do another hardback of all my black and white art, pencils and inks. The black and white book will be a matching book to this hard back color book. If you have purchased this color book and you purchase the black and white book, you will have a matching set of hardback books that cover around 95% of my life’s work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll definitely be buying that one, too.</p>

            <description>Over thirty years later, Blade Runner still remains one of my favorite films (as I’ve previously blogged about). It was only six weeks ago that I sat down and watched it again – it is easily one of the movies I can watch over and over and still enjoy with a sense of wonder.
I’m not the only one who shares a passion for Blade Runner, as fans have paid tribute to the classic film in a few ways in 2013:</description>

<p>I’m not the only one who shares a passion for Blade Runner, as fans have paid tribute to the classic film in a few ways in 2013:</p>
<p>Blade Runner: 8 Bit Cinema – here is the film re-told as a classic video game.  If only this was a real game! (<a href="http://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/how-is-this-8-bit-blade-runner-game-not-actually-real-1135877073">Via Gizmodo</a>)</p>
<p>[//www.youtube.com/embed/OM6z9czN318]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/moments-lost">Moments Lost: Music and Art inspired by Blade Runner</a>. This is an IndieGoGo campaign to create a full length soundtrack using Vangelis’ original recording equipment. (Vangelis did the original soundtrack to the film). It will also include 8 stories and 8 illustrations as part of the fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>[//www.youtube.com/embed/PFCnJ-R33jw]</p>
<p>Lastly, here is Blade Runner done as 12,000 hand painted water color paintings.  As <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/11/20/blade-runner-animated-as-1200.html">Rob Beschizza of Boing Boing wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>absolutely stunning</em> work of <a href="http://www.andersramsell.com/">Swedish artist Anders Ramsell</a>, who painted each frame as a 1.5 x 3cm work of art. It’s taken him a while to complete the epic job; Pesco <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/06/20/watercolor-animation-of-blade.html">wrote about the first three minutes</a> last year. The end result runs about 30 minutes, which is exactly how long <em>Blade Runner</em> should be.</p>

            <description>Fall is here in Minnesota and the mornings are crisp and the leaves have turned. Living here in the winter may be awful, but I can see why fall is my wife’s favorite time of year.
After taking our black lab for a 3 mile walk this morning, it was time to warm up with one of my favorite comfort foods. Using a recipe from Hilah Cooking, it was time to make my first batch of macaroni and cheese of the year.</description>

<p>Fall is here in Minnesota and the mornings are crisp and the leaves have turned. Living here in the winter may be awful, but I can see why fall is my wife’s favorite time of year.</p>
<p>After taking our black lab for a 3 mile walk this morning, it was time to warm up with one of my favorite comfort foods. Using a <a href="http://hilahcooking.com/green-chili-macaroni-and-cheese/">recipe from Hilah Cooking</a>, it was time to make my first batch of macaroni and cheese of the year. This recipe will definitely warm you up – it calls for 4 jalapeños or a can of green chili peppers, giving some kick to the macaroni and cheese. This was perfect as I had 5 jalapeño peppers left from the last CSA box.</p>
<p>Hilah’s recipe is pretty straight forward – watch the video below for how to make it, and she will teach you how to make the roux and béchamel on your way to the finished product. I was worried that four jalapenos would be too much and it would be way too spicy – but it was just right. It warms you all the way through, both the heat of the peppers and the warmth of the mac and cheese. I did dice all of my peppers and did not leave strips as you’ll see in the video. I like my mac and cheese with a crispy topping, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/10655828646/in/photostream/">so I added some Panko bread crumbs and baked</a> it for just over 10 minutes. Baking it will reduce how creamy it is, so it’s up to you on the tradeoff.</p>

<p>What I love about Hilah’s recipes and cooking channel is the recipes are not complex, great for someone like me who is learning the ins and outs of cooking – but the end result is always tasty. Check out the video below and subscribe to her channel.</p>

            <description>We all love zombies. The Walking Dead is one of the most popular TV shows currently on. A new zombie movie seems to come out every year.
But a real zombie apocalypse? Nature would never let it happen.
BoingBoing has a great essay up by National Wildlife Federation naturalist David Mizejewski on how nature would deal with a zombie outbreak. From birds to mammals to bacteria, zombies wouldn’t stand a chance:</description>

<p>But a real zombie apocalypse? Nature would never let it happen.</p>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/10/14/zombiesvsanimals.html">BoingBoing has a great essay up</a> by National Wildlife Federation naturalist David Mizejewski on how nature would deal with a zombie outbreak. From birds to mammals to bacteria, zombies wouldn’t stand a chance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, it’s not the North America’s mega-fauna that pose the most threat to zombies. In nature, there are a whole host of tiny creatures whose main purpose is to feed upon and break down the flesh of the dead: the decomposers. Zombies, with their rotting flesh, are obviously not immune to these decomposers (what do you think causes the rotting effect?), many of which are too small to see with the bare eye. Bacteria, fungi, molds, insects such as fly maggots or flesh-eating beetles, and other invertebrates, all make up nature’s diminutive clean-up crew. And it can obliterate a dead body in surprisingly little time. The clumsy undead wouldn’t have the dexterity to pick off these decomposers, even if they could see or feel them. It would just be a matter of time. Stripped off all soft tissue, including brains, the zombies would be reduced to hollowed-out skeletons.</p>

<p>Now you can rest easier at night.</p>

            <description>I just got back from a business trip where we took a customer down to Key West, Florida. I’m not much of an outdoorsman, but we had an event where we went deep sea fishing.
I caught a 45″ barracuda – the first mate said it was one of the biggest catches he’s seen in a few years. I also learned I really enjoy jet skiing. Fun trip!</description>

            <description>SF Signal, the most recent Hugo award winning fanzine, posted a meme on Saturday with a “last” theme. Here we go:
 The last sf/f book I finished reading: Shift Omnibus by Hugh Howey The last sf/f book I did NOT finish: Perdido Street Station by China Miéville (I loved The City &amp;amp; the City but just could not finish this one. It’s very rare for me to not finish a book.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sfsignal.com/">SF Signal</a>, the most recent <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2013-hugo-awards/">Hugo award winning fanzine</a>, posted a meme on Saturday with a “last” theme.  Here we go:</p>
<ol>
<li>The last sf/f book I finished reading: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shift-Omnibus-Silo-Saga-ebook/dp/B00B6Z6HI2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1381151926&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=shift+omnibus"><em>Shift Omnibus</em></a> by Hugh Howey</li>
<li>The last sf/f book I did NOT finish: <em>Perdido Street Station</em> by China Miéville (I loved <em>The City &amp; the City</em> but just could not finish this one.  It’s very rare for me to not finish a book.)</li>
<li>The last sf/f book(s) I bought: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ancillary-Justice-ebook/dp/B00BAXFDLM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1381151899&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ancillary+justice"><em>Ancillary Justice</em></a> by Ann Leckie</li>
<li>The last sf/f book I bought that I already owned: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reamde-A-Novel-ebook/dp/B004XVN0WW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1381151960&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=reamde">Reamde</a></em> by Neal Stephenson (I buy all of his books in hardcover and Amazon had the Kindle version for $2.  Couldn’t resist).</li>
<li>The last sf/f book I shared with someone: <em>A Game of Thrones</em> (a co-worker is sucked into the TV series and wanted to read the books.  He agrees the books are even better, as good as the HBO series is).</li>
<li>The last sf/f book I raved about: <em>Ancillary Justice</em> – I just started reading it this weekend and am <a href="https://twitter.com/prcutler/status/386907097637453824">already raving</a> about it.  We’ll see how the end is.</li>
<li>The last sf/f book I did not enjoy at all: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005M2RRRA/ref=oh_d__o00_details_o00__i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"><em>There Goes the Galaxy</em></a> by Jenn Thorson.  It was another Kindle deal for free or a buck.  If you look at the reviews, it has 33 5 star reviews and 21 4 star reviews (54 out of 61 reviews).  It was trite, the writing wasn’t all that great and you could see the end coming a mile away.  It tried way too hard to be in the vein of <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> and just didn’t pull it off.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re not reading <a href="http://www.sfsignal.com">SFSignal</a>, you should be – it’s worth it for the daily round-up of links to discounted and free eBooks alone.  There is a very good reason they won the Hugo for best Fanzine this year.</p>

            <description>Photo by Johnny Wallker under a CC-NC-ND 2.0 license I’m cleaning up some open tabs and a story of interest to me is related to the 1999 game Homeworld from Relic Entertainment.
Relic Entertainment was bought by THQ in 2004 and THQ went bankrupt this year, auctioning off a lot of old assets, Homeworld included. Six months ago TeamPixel, a small studio, started a Kickstarter campaign to gather support to try and win the rights to Homeworld from the bankruptcy court.</description>

<p>I’m cleaning up some open tabs and a story of interest to me is related to the 1999 game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld">Homeworld</a> from Relic Entertainment.</p>
<p>Relic Entertainment was bought by THQ in 2004 and THQ went bankrupt this year, auctioning off a lot of old assets, Homeworld included.  Six months ago TeamPixel, a small studio, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/teampix/homeworld-touch-ios-android-and-homeworld-3-pc-mac">started a Kickstarter campaign</a> to gather support to try and win the rights to Homeworld from the bankruptcy court.  TeamPixel had a goal to bring Homeworld to iOS and Android as well as creating Homeworld 3 for Mac, Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>Homeworld was extremely innovative for its time.  Featuring large space battles in three dimensions (and ships you lost didn’t go with you to the next mission), a great storyline and an active mod community, there was nothing else like it.</p>
<p>The auction and Kickstarter had some buzz – after I <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/tweets/312032760032284672/">tweeted</a> that I supported the Kickstarter, I was surprised how many replies I received with other people showing interest in it as well.</p>
<p>TeamPixel did not win the auction for the rights in bankruptcy court.  It was later revealed that <a href="http://www.gearboxsoftware.com/">Gearbox</a>, a <a href="http://www.gearboxsoftware.com/games">studio known more for first person shooters</a> including Borderlands, Brothers in Arms, finishing Duke Nukem Forever and Counter-Strike did.</p>
<p>Back in August, Gearbox <a href="http://www.gearboxsoftware.com/community/articles/1075">shared their plans for Homeworld in their developer blog, Inside the Box</a>.  They plan to re-release Homeworld and Homeworld 2 for digital release (I’m guessing Steam) updating it to use the latest PC hardware.</p>
<p>The blog post is great – Brian Burleson shares his excitement in winning the auction and some of the challenges ahead in bringing Homeworld to modern technology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When all the paperwork cleared and the source code was delivered we finally were able to unwrap what had eluded us for so long only to find that… the bike had one pedal, needed a new chain and overall was just missing parts. Granted, we knew this bike was 10-15 years old and hadn’t been touched by the original owner in quite some time, but still!</p>
<p>That’s when the real work started, and boy howdy, did all of those people who reached out to us at the beginning come in handy!</p>
<p>Over the course of a couple of months we were able to find the missing pieces and started to get the bike, erm, game, working again. (I’ll drop the bike metaphor now.)</p>
<p>As Martel mentioned during <a href="http://www.gearboxsoftware.com/community/articles/1067/pax-australia-news-recap">our panel at PAX Australia</a>, it’s been a struggle to get all of the original tools working again. Just for comparison, the source drop we got from the purchase of the Homeworld property was 16.8 gigs. The sum of all the additional missing source we got from friends who had worked on the games originally was about 39 gigs. The two have almost zero overlap!</p>
<p>For example, Homeworld 2 was largely developed in a heavily customized version Maya 3. (Something we still haven’t located.) This means that if we wanted to update Homeworld 2 content for an HD version, we needed to turn to different tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Give the whole thing a read.  Here’s to hoping Gearbox is successful and can bring this back cross-platform as well – I’d love to play Homeworld again on my Mac!</p>

            <description>Summer is the slow time for new music releases and August saw a number of great new releases, with even more coming later this fall.
Here’s some of the new releases I picked up on vinyl in August:
 Superchunk – I Hate Music: The alt rockers have been around since 1989(!) and I Hate Music is their tenth album. The album is short and sweet, clocking in at just over 37 minutes.</description>

<p>Here’s some of the new releases I picked up on vinyl in August:</p>
<ul>
<li>Superchunk – <em>I Hate Music</em>:  The alt rockers have been around since 1989(!) and I Hate Music is their tenth album.  The album is short and sweet, clocking in at just over 37 minutes.  If you’re a fan of Superchunk there isn’t anything new here, and that’s a good thing.  (I also picked up the Divine Fits 12″ at the same time featured in the picture below).</li>
<li>Volcano Choir – <em>Repave</em>: Justin Vernon of Bon Iver joins up with Wisconsin’s Collection of a Colony of Bees for their second album.  Mr. Vernon says he didn’t write any of the music – the one chord he wrote the band didn’t use.  But to me, this could easily be a 3rd Bon Iver album.  <a href="http://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/09/16/album-review-volcano-choir-repave">Barb Abney of The Current wrote a fantastic review</a> a couple weeks back when it was The Current’s Album of the Week.  Highly recommended.</li>
<li>Neko Case – <em>The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, The More I Love You</em>:  Neko Case released her 6th solo album and it’s fantastic.  The alt-country darling follows up 2009’s Middle Cyclone with an album that works through her recent depression after recently losing her grandmother and both parents – and it works.  The pacing of the album is fantastic and she clearly opens her soul and bares it all.  The vinyl release is stunning – both the artwork and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/9645854267/">Side D of the vinyl release</a>, which doesn’t have any music, features a stunning etching that covers the album.  Middle Cyclone was the first new vinyl album I bought on Record Store Day 2010 in clear vinyl and holds a special place in my heart.</li>

            <description>Since I turned 40 earlier this year, it was time my mid-life crisis kicked in.
Ok, that’s not true – two years ago my wife and I each set some goals, with the reward of getting a tattoo. She set a running goal (I don’t remember how many miles she had to run over the course of the year) and my goal was to get under 200 pounds. In just over 2 years, I’ve lost 40 pounds, and that was mostly stopping and starting running and working out.</description>

<p>A friend who has had a lot of work done recommended <a href="http://www.electricdragonland.com/">Electric Dragonland</a> in Hopkins, MN.  I finally worked up the courage to call and make an appointment for a consultation – and of course they had an opening that day.  I got lucky as they’re usually a few months booked out and Damion did a great job:</p>

<p>If you’re not familiar with the symbol, it’s a 45 adapter for a turntable.  A little bigger than I had planned, but I’m very happy with how it turned out.  My backup tattoo was the Pearl Jam stick man from their first single, <em>Alive</em>.  Coincidentally, <a href="http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2013/09/the_story_of_my_pearl_jam_tattoo_and_why_i_still_love_it.php">Gimme Noise had an article yesterday</a> with the writer talking about his first and only tattoo – the Pearl Jam stick man.</p>

            <description>One of the albums I’ve been looking forward to the most this year is finally out today. The Bones of What You Believe In by the Glasgow band Chvrches has had singles released all summer long and the wait has been killing me. I’m only half way through my first listen on Rdio and it’s everything I wanted and more.
UPS will be delivering my vinyl copy later today and I can’t wait to give it a spin.</description>

            <description>Via BoingBoing and The Guardian:
GOP and Democratic Congressmen have been denied information from the House Intelligence Committee on details of NSA spying. When they ask for information on how the Committee voted, the Committee won’t tell them the details of the vote or how other House members voted. It is supposedly “classified”. These Congressmen are being asked to vote on continuing to fund NSA operations and can’t even get the information they need to make a vote based on the facts.</description>

            <description>I vividly remember reading Omni Magazine growing up, both in my local library and my high school’s library. The mix of science writing and science fiction stories were fantastical and helped shape me for years to come. It was there I first encountered the writing of George R.R. Martin with his story Sandkings and other authors I would read as an adult.
Glenn Fleishman wrote recently at Boing Boing about who owns the copyrights of the former magazine:</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I vividly remember reading <a href="http://archive.org/details/omni-magazine">Omni Magazine</a> growing up, both in my local library and my high school’s library. The mix of science writing and science fiction stories were fantastical and helped shape me for years to come. It was there I first encountered the writing of George R.R. Martin with his story Sandkings and other authors I would read as an adult.</p>
<p>Glenn Fleishman <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/07/09/who-owns-omni.html">wrote recently at Boing Boing</a> about who owns the copyrights of the former magazine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Weintraub believes she has as good an explanation for Omni’s limbo as anyone: General Media never owned it, she said. To her knowledge, it was privately owned by Keeton and Guccione. As far as she knows, and I have found no contradiction, the various rights to the magazine would have been transferred to some creditor of Guccione’s — but it’s possible the creditor didn’t even realize that it had obtained these rights. And, in any case, those rights only seemingly include the work-for-hire pieces.</p>
<p>No party has appeared to ask the Internet Archive or Omni Magazine Online to take down any material. The authors and artists whose work appeared in the publication and which is available through the Internet Archive could ostensibly assert a right, but it would require substantial documentation to qualify under the DMCA since no party asserts ownership to Omni as a collective work.</p>

<p>Mr. Fleishman’s article is also a fascinating recap of the rise and fall of the magazine. Today, Mr. Fleishman <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/08/02/omni.html">breaks the news</a> that <a href="http://jeremyfrommer.com/">Jeremy Frommer</a>, whom we learned in the first article bought a storage locker with the production archives in Omni, is planning on relaunching Omni next week as <a href="http://omnireboot.com/">Omni Reboot</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is also interested in reissuing Omni’s far-ahead-of-its-time comics collections, and has been talking to the artists who appeared in the three editions produced. If he can get the rights worked out, he may republish those and then commission a fourth book along the same lines.</p>
<p>The best news, however, isn’t about the past, but about next week. Omni Reboot is a new publication, edited by Claire L. Evans, a writer and artist. It goes live next week. Frommer says they have hired writers and artists to bring what he calls the “Omni vibe” to 2013, and they want fresh blood, not just established practitioners. To all happy mutants, Frommer says, come aboard. “Those visionary writers who believe in that Omni vibe, they should reach out to me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The site is just a placeholder until next week, but I know I can’t wait and will be frequently refreshing the page.</p>

            <description>Last weekend, my wife had a craving for pretzels. No, she’s not pregnant, she just loves pretzels. We’re talking the big, huge soft pretzels covered in salt. She wanted them badly enough that she even asked if the Twins were in town – and she doesn’t like baseball. We were also looking up to see if there were any places in the Twin Cities known for their pretzels, but didn’t find much outside of a couple mall restaurants, and we weren’t feeling that brave.</description>

<p>As I’ve dived into cooking over the last year, one of the best things I’ve found to help teach me to cook has been <a href="http://hilahcooking.com/" title="Hilah Cooking">Hilah Cooking</a>, a website and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/hilahcooking">Youtube channel</a> hosted by Hilah Johnson for beginner to intermediate cooks. I’ve <a href="http://hilahcooking.com/learn-to-cook-book/">bought her cookbook</a> and watched countless videos teaching me a ton of things I didn’t know, especially about how to cook, not just what to cook. These include how to season a cast iron skillet, smoke points of oil, and more. Some of these things may be basic to those who have been cooking a while, but I’ve never had anyone really show me these things, and learning them has been invaluable.</p>
<p>The best part about both Hilah’s writing and Youtube channel is her humor. I enjoy it and it makes it much more fun to watch than a dry cooking show on some cable channel. Also, being on Youtube, I can just grab my iPad and re-watch the episode while I cook, which is so helpful.</p>
<p>By chance, Hilah posted a soft pretzel recipe two days ago. The timing couldn’t have been better with my wife’s cravings, so I ran out to the store yesterday and picked up some yeast and bread flour. The recipe is very simple and the pretzels turned out great. They took a little longer to cook then the recipe calls for and they’re not as dark brown as shown the video. I’m not sure if that’s due to the beer I used, but they tasted fantastic, which is what matters! The wife agreed and I see us making more of these in the future.</p>
<p>Here’s the episode from Hilah’s Youtube channel as she visits Easy Tiger in Austin, known for their pretzels and beer garden, as well as the recipe.</p>

            <description>For the last few weeks, Neil Gaiman has tweeted links to a cryptic new website that asked you to RSVP (via email) to a website, Who Haunts Neil. Yesterday, if you had sent an RSVP, you received an email with an update to this very mysterious site, with Mr. Gaiman hosting a video introducing his latest project: Wayward Manor.

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the last few weeks, Neil Gaiman has tweeted links to a cryptic new website that asked you to RSVP (via email) to a website, <a href="http://whohauntsneil.com/">Who Haunts Neil</a>. Yesterday, if you had sent an RSVP, you received an email with an update to this very mysterious site, with Mr. Gaiman hosting a video introducing his latest project: <em>Wayward Manor</em>.</p>
<p>Neil, in partnership with game studio The Odd Gentlemen, is launching his first game. <em>Wayward Manor</em> will be a puzzle / adventure hybrid and is doing a Kickstarter-like funding campaign, where you can <a href="http://whohauntsneil.com/welcome/#shop">pre-order the game</a> at a number of different payment tiers with different rewards. It will be released first on PC &amp; Mac, and a tablet version is planned.</p>
<p>If you know anything of Neil Gaiman, he has a love and personal passion in the macabre – a word he even uses to describe the game. He’s previously talked about how he loves <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Addams">Charles Addams</a> and this seems to fit right in to that kind of genre.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to see Neil a few weeks ago in Bloomington, MN on his book tour for The Ocean at the End of the Lane and he remains one of my favorite authors. I’m excited to see his first foray into video games.</p>
<p>Watch the video below hosted by Neil and his adorable English accent introducing <em>Wayward Manor</em>.</p>

            <description>I’m a fan of the show How I Met Your Mother. Like most viewers though, I’m of th eopinion it’s time for the show to end. As much as I’ve enjoyed it over the years, I was disappointed when they decided to extend it one more year.
Apparently, Ted’s kids agree with me, from this video show at this years Comic-Con.
(Why CBS doesn’t allow it to be embedded is beyond me…)</description>

Iain Banks, one of my favorite authors, was diagnosed with cancer this past April, which I previously wrote about. He passed away yesterday at the age of 59.
Charlie Stross and Neil Gaiman each share their thoughts on his passing. Their words far surpass anything I could write.
Godspeed Mr. Banks.

            <title>EFF: Why Metadata Matters</title>

            <description>In response to the recent news reports about the National Security Agency’s surveillance program, President Barack Obama said today, “When it comes to telephone calls, nobody is listening to your telephone calls.” Instead, the government was just “sifting through this so-called metadata.” The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made a similar comment last night: “The program does not allow the Government to listen in on anyone’s phone calls. The information acquired does not include the content of any communications or the identity of any subscriber.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In response to the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/confirmed-nsa-spying-millions-americans">recent news reports</a> about the National Security Agency’s surveillance program, President Barack Obama <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/06/07/transcript-what-obama-said-on-nsa-controversy/">said today</a>, “When it comes to telephone calls, nobody is listening to your telephone calls.” Instead, the government was just “sifting through this so-called metadata.” The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made a similar <a href="http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/868-dni-statement-on-recent-unauthorized-disclosures-of-classified-information">comment</a> last night:  “The program does not allow the Government to listen in on anyone’s phone calls. The information acquired does not include the content of any communications or the identity of any subscriber.”</p>
<p>What they are trying to say is that disclosure of metadata—the details about phone calls, without the actual voice—isn’t a big deal, not something for Americans to get upset about if the government knows. Let’s take a closer look at what they are saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>They know you rang a phone sex service at 2:24 am and spoke for 18 minutes. But they don’t know what you talked about.</li>
<li>They know you called the suicide prevention hotline from the Golden Gate Bridge. But the topic of the call remains a secret.</li>
<li>They know you spoke with an HIV testing service, then your doctor, then your health insurance company in the same hour. But they don’t know what was discussed.</li>
<li>They know you received a call from the local NRA office while it was having a campaign against gun legislation, and then called your senators and congressional representatives immediately after. But the content of those calls remains safe from government intrusion.</li>
<li>They know you called a gynecologist, spoke for a half hour, and then called the local Planned Parenthood’s number later that day. But nobody knows what you spoke about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry, your phone records—oops, “so-called metadata”—can reveal a lot more about the content of your calls than the government is implying. Metadata provides enough context to know some of the most intimate details of your lives.  And the government has given no assurances that this data will never be correlated with other easily obtained data. They may start out with just a phone number, but a <a href="http://www.whitepages.com/reverse_phone">reverse telephone directory</a> is not hard to find. Given the public positions the government has taken on <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/location-privacy">location information</a>, it would be no surprise if they include location information demands in Section 215 orders for metadata.</p>
<p>If the President really welcomes a robust debate on the government’s surveillance power, it needs to start being honest about the invasiveness of collecting your metadata.</p>

This commercial has it all – and the best part is some of the in-jokes for Star Trek fans. I don’t want to spoil it for you, so go spend 2 minutes of your life and watch it.

            <description>I don’t remember how I was first introduced to Henry Rollins and his spoken word performances. I know it was a long, long time ago and when I first purchased the CD Box Set of his albums, it was over twenty years ago now. I wore those CDs out and they helped me drive cross-country at least once.
For a man who got his start in punk music singing for Black Flag, Henry may be the closest thing we have to a Renaissance man.</description>

<p>I don’t remember how I was first introduced to Henry Rollins and his spoken word performances. I know it was a long, long time ago and when I first purchased the CD Box Set of his albums, it was over twenty years ago now. I wore those CDs out and they helped me drive cross-country at least once.</p>
<p>For a man who got his start in punk music singing for Black Flag, Henry may be the closest thing we have to a Renaissance man. He sings and writes music, writes poetry, acts, and tours non-stop on his spoken word tours. His stories are touching, funny, and over the last 10 years, he has become much more political with his messages, in a good way. Just don’t read his poetry – after I first got into Henry, I bought a couple of his books, and it was the darkest, most depressing poetry I’ve ever read. But when you see him live on a spoken word tour, he’s mesmerizing.</p>
<p>I haven’t listened to the CDs or watched a video in quite a while – but <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/04/07/some-rollins.html">Boing Boing linked</a> to <a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/04/rollins-2/">JWZ’s site</a> today, with some videos of Henry doing his spoken word thing. Next thing I know, an hour has gone by and I have a craving for some more Rollins.</p>
<p>I’m a bit disappointed to see Netflix doesn’t have any of his shows available any more. But I know what I’ll be listening to while I work this week.</p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.paulcutler.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/useofweapons.jpg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>The first book I read of Iain Bainks was his Culture novel, Use of Weapons. He writes his science fiction books as Iain M. Banks and his fiction books as Iain Banks. Use of Weapons is still by far my favorite book from the Culture series – and when the protagonist makes a cameo appearance years later in a different book, I was thrilled (don’t worry, I won’t spoil which one!) The Culture books are one of the most imaginative and unique universes ever created. I can’t do justice trying to explain it, but Wikipedia has a detailed page about all things <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture">Culture</a>. One of my favorite things is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spacecraft_in_the_Culture_series">names he gives the ships / AI</a> in his books – how he came up with these names is beyond me, but they’re hilarious and stunning at the same time.</p>
<p>Years later I would dive into his fiction as well. The themes of his books, whether fiction or science fiction, deal with the human condition and how we interact with family, friends and the groups we belong to and are a part of.</p>
<p>I can’t recommend his books enough and I’m thankful I’ve been able to share in his imagination.</p>

This Saturday, March 30th, is Table Top Day! Geek &amp;amp; Sundry has organized an international day to support, enjoy and play table top games. About a year ago a friend invited a friend of ours, my eldest son and myself over to have a table top gaming night. I was blown away by number of games now available. You’ve probably heard of some of the biggest, such as Settlers of Catan, but there is a revolution going on in old school games.</description>

<p>This Saturday, March 30th, is <a href="http://www.tabletopday.com/" title="Table Top Day">Table Top Day</a>! <a href="http://www.geekandsundry.com/" title="Geek and Sundry">Geek &amp; Sundry</a> has organized an international day to support, enjoy and play table top games. About a year ago a friend invited a friend of ours, my eldest son and myself over to have a table top gaming night. I was blown away by number of games now available. You’ve probably heard of some of the biggest, such as Settlers of Catan, but there is a revolution going on in old school games. We don’t get together as often as we’d like, but about a month ago we scheduled it for this Friday night – coincidentally, just a day before Table Top Day, which Felicia Day talks about in the video above.</p>
<p>I’ve bought a number of games to play with my littler two over the last year, most notably <a href="http://www.firesidegames.com/castlepanic.html">Castle Panic</a> and <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/" title="Small World">Small World</a>. Tuesday nights are now game night with the kids, whether it’s a board game, chess or a card game. We usually try and play more games over the weekend as well. I really like that Castle Panic is a co-op game – working together takes a lot of the competitiveness (and trash talking) out, making a more enjoyable experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Small World also <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/online/en/smallworld/ipad/">released an iPad version</a> last year and are now working on Small World 2. The sequel is looking for <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/daysofwonder/small-world-2-the-return" title="Small World 2 on Kickstarter">funding on Kickstarter</a>, with the hope of building a version for PC (on Steam), Android tablets, and iPad. If you’ve already purchased the iPad game, it will be a free upgrade on iPad.</p>
<p>[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/daysofwonder/small-world-2-the-return/widget/video.html]</p>
<p>One of my favorite features of Small World 2, is if the player starting the game owns any of the expansions, you get to play the expansion as well – even if you haven’t bought it.</p>
<p>I highly recommend Small World – if you’re looking for a new take on the classic board game, this game has it all – strategy, quick combat and turns, and infinitely replayable.</p>
<p>Want to learn more? The very first episode of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9QtdiRJYro">Table Top on Geek and Sundry reviewed Small World</a>:</p>
<p>[http://www.youtube.com/embed/X9QtdiRJYro]</p>
<p>So grab a game and play some board games this Saturday, for <a href="http://tabletopday.com/" title="Table Top Day">Table Top Day!</a></p>

You can’t turn around these days without hearing about Kickstarter. From movies, music, books or technology products, it seems everyone is using Kickstarter to raise funds to start a project. Over the course of the next week, I’ll be blogging about some of the projects I’ve backed, reviews, and thoughts about how Kickstarter may be used in the future.
What is Kickstarter? From their frequently asked questions:
 _Kickstarter is a funding platform for creative projects.</description>

<p>You can’t turn around these days without hearing about <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com" title="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a>. From movies, music, books or technology products, it seems everyone is using Kickstarter to raise funds to start a project. Over the course of the next week, I’ll be blogging about some of the projects I’ve backed, reviews, and thoughts about how Kickstarter may be used in the future.</p>
<p>What is Kickstarter? From their <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/kickstarter+basics?ref=nav">frequently asked questions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_Kickstarter is a funding platform for creative projects. Everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology. Kickstarter is full of ambitious, innovative, and imaginative projects that are brought to life through the direct support of others.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Since our launch on April 28, 2009, over $500 million has been pledged by more than 3 million people, funding more than 35,000 creative projects<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I first heard about Kickstarter in 2009 when <a href="http://www.polyvinylrecords.com/" title="Polyvinyl">Polyvinyl</a>, a small music label out of Champaign, Illinois, started a Kickstarter to save some records:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Polyvinyl needs your help! Some of our distributor’s warehouses around the world are being downsized or consolidated and we either need to destroy over 10,000 records or face some high storage costs.</p>
<p>Destroying the records is not an option (it’s too wasteful and besides, these are great records, they’re just overstocked)! Storing the records at our warehouse is not an option (we cannot afford the storage costs). So to keep them from destruction, we’re hoping to have all the records shipped back to our office.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had heard of a few Polyvinyl artists from listening to <a href="http://www.thecurrent.org" title="The Current">The Current</a>, most notably <a href="http://www.ofmontreal.net/" title="of Montreal">of Montreal</a>, and supporting their Kickstarter seemed like a great way to support them and to be introduced to some new artists.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter worked great. I received my CDs after the Kickstarter closed, but more importantly, I became a loyal Polyvinyl customer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4742456749/" title="sdc10164.jpg by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>I would go on to buy vinyl from Polyvinyl fairly frequently, buying artists I had heard on the radio (of Montreal, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin) to taking chances on new artists or artists I hadn’t heard of (Deerhoof, Stagnant Pools, Japandroids) because I knew Polyvinyl was a quality label and did a good job of curating artists. The best part? Polyvinyl always throws something extra in to each order. They’re famous for including a piece of Airheads candy with each order and always throw in an extra CD to introduce you to another artist on their label. Their vinyl records are high quality 180g releases, the album art and posters are printed on high quality stock, and they also usually have extras you can order, from buttons to t-shirts and more.</p>
<p>This is just one way using Kickstarter can introduce you to a new brand or company and hopefully I’m not the only person who became a loyal customer because of their Kickstarter.</p>

            <description>Have you tried to buy concert tickets lately? Once you get past the sticker shock of how much a ticket will cost you, especially with the fees, you can then enjoy the frustration of trying to find seats. Good seats. And you won’t find many.
Here’s six reasons why.
And that’s why I only go see shows at clubs.</description>

            <title>Can arcades make a comeback?</title>

            <description>Having been born in the early 70’s, I am a child of the 80’s. One of the best parts of being a child of the 80’s was living through the boom (and later bust) of the arcades. Whether it was going to Godfather’s Pizza and playing a handful of arcade games or Chuck E. Cheese with dozens of games or getting dropped off at an arcade in a mall while my parents went shopping, the fun in plugging quarters in for hours can never be re-lived.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/8501084208/" title="2013-02-16 14.06.36 by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Having been born in the early 70’s, I am a child of the 80’s. One of the best parts of being a child of the 80’s was living through the boom (and later bust) of the arcades. Whether it was going to Godfather’s Pizza and playing a handful of arcade games or Chuck E. Cheese with dozens of games or getting dropped off at an arcade in a mall while my parents went shopping, the fun in plugging quarters in for hours can never be re-lived.</p>
<p>Or can it? In the last year, two arcades have popped up in the Twin Cities. <a href="http://www.rqarcade.com/">Rusty Quarters</a>, in South Minneapolis, opened last year and has an <a href="http://www.rqarcade.com/Game_List.html">impressive list of arcade cabinets</a> available for play at $0.50 per play.</p>
<p><a href="http://zap-arcade.com/">Zap-Arcade</a>, located in Jordan, almost an hour from the Twin Cities (but only 15-20 minutes from where I live in the suburbs) also opened last year and has a unique pricing model. You can buy a day pass for $5.00 or family pass for $15.00 and play all of the games for as long as you want to stay. They also have monthly plans available.</p>
<p>The kids had a blast, but they didn’t know better. Zap Arcade has two floors, with 12 cabinets one each floor. I was disappointed with the games available. They had three “A” games available – Pac-Man (a re-issue, which featured about 8 different ways to play Pac-Man or Ms. Pac-Man), Space Invaders, and Galaga (which wasn’t working). They had a few “B” titles – Double Dragon, Araknoid, X-Men, Zaxxon, and Raiden. The rest were third tier titles which few people would remember from the hey day of the 80’s. All the games were on free play, though there were times you had to grab an employee to open up the cabinet to add more credits.</p>
<p>The price was right – for two hours of entertainment for a family of 4, it was far cheaper than going to a movie and the kids had a blast. I was worried that Jack, who is only seven, would get frustrated, but he was happy to bounce from game to game trying different things and didn’t get frustrated.</p>
<p>I was happy to see the place was busy. We got there fairly early after opening, and more people and families filled the place up quickly over the course of the two hours we were there. Hopefully they will be stay busy over time giving them some revenue to buy even more cabinets. We’ll definitely be back.</p>
<p>If you, like me, are nostalgic for arcades, The Verge has a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/16/3740422/the-life-and-death-of-the-american-arcade-for-amusement-only">great look back on the rise and fall of the arcade industry</a>.</p>

            <description>Congratulations to U-Turn Audio for their successful Kickstarter campaign to bring to market a low cost, high quality turntable – The Orbit.
From their Kickstarter page:
 We love listening to music on vinyl, and we believe that everyone should have access to a quality vinyl experience. But we found that capable turntables were prohibitively expensive. That’s why we designed the Orbit – a remarkably simple turntable that cuts the cost of high-performance playback in half.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to <a href="http://www.uturnaudio.com/">U-Turn Audio</a> for their <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/uturnaudio/the-orbit-turntable-0?ref=live">successful Kickstarter campaign to bring to market a low cost, high quality turntable</a> – The Orbit.</p>

That’s why we designed the Orbit – a remarkably simple turntable that cuts the cost of high-performance playback in half.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m a big fan of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com" title="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> and strongly considered buying The Orbit. I’d like to pick up a second turntable for the living room, which my wife thinks is ludicrous considering my setup in my home theater room in the basement. But something appeals to me to listen to records in a sun filled room on a weekend afternoon rather than my artificially lit man-cave.</p>
<p>I decided not to buy the Orbit though for a couple of different reasons. I was concerned about the opportunity to not see the turntable first and look at the build quality. It’s driven by a fully manual drive belt and I was concerned over time if it would need to be replaced and, if they can’t build a business model, if parts would be available. I also wanted to see how it looked, as it was made out of MDF.</p>
<p>It’s only $150 (including the $50 Ortofon cartridge), but I’m blessed that the <a href="http://www.needledoctor.com" title="Needle Doctor">Needle Doctor</a> is based here in the Twin Cities. When (or as my wife would say, if) I buy a second turntable, I would buy it at the Needle Doctor. An entry level <a href="http://www.needledoctor.com/Denon-DP300F-with-2M-Red-Package?sc=2&amp;category=46">Denon DP300F</a>, which includes a $100 Ortofon 2M cartridge, is $419.00. The ability to purchase it in person and have them help set the arm and load the cartridge is worth the extra money and not having to worry if something breaks in shipping. And that’s not saying anything about warranty support.</p>
<p>But that’s just me. I’m happy to see a company trying to make turntables affordable to the masses. $175, including shipping, is a great way for people to re-discover the joy of viny.</p>

            <description>It feels like yesterday that Minnesota Public Radio announced they would be launching their own indie rock station with a focus on local music. 89.3 The Current hired a number well known of on-air personalities who had worked in the Twin Cities for years, with experience at Rev105, RadioK and more, which just added to the excitement. Giddy with anticipation, I donated to MPR, becoming a founding member even before the station had launched.</description>

Giddy with anticipation, I donated to MPR, becoming a founding member even before the station had launched. (Getting a free vinyl record to celebrate from The Current was just a bonus – who knew that I would get back into vinyl just a few years later and would make this the first record I would listen to after I bought a turntable).</p>
<p>And here we are eight years later already! For the last few years The Current throws a big birthday bash at the legendary <a href="http://first-avenue.com/">First Avenue</a>. I had to pass up tickets to the second night show on Saturday (twice) and as I followed the event on Twitter, I had to kick myself. In addition to an awesome line-up of Now, Now, Dave Pirner (of Soul Asylum), and Cloud Cult, the special surprise guest was the YN Rich Kids, the summer’s hottest local sensation.</p>
<p>You haven’t heard of them? A good friend of mine hadn’t either as I texted him at the show.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>If you missed it over the summer, this video went viral in the Twin Cities in a big way. Time Magazine even named it the <a href="http://entertainment.time.com/2012/12/18/9-best-music-videos-of-2012/slide/yn-rich-kids-hot-cheetos-takis/">#7 best music video of 2012</a> and The Current gave it some radio coverage, too.</p>
<p>I knew I should have bought tickets when I had the chance! Well, there is always next year…</p>
<p>Happy Birthday 89.3! Keep on rockin’!</p>

            <description>Tonight marks the end of Fringe’s five year run on Fox. Created by J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who were the early showrunners for Alias, and would the latter two would go on to write Transformers and Star Trek, which Mr. Abrams directed as well. Fringe began as a cross between the X-Files and Alias, featuring a monster of the week story in addition to the overarching story lines about Walter’s past.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight marks the end of Fringe’s five year run on Fox. Created by J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who were the early showrunners for Alias, and would the latter two would go on to write Transformers and Star Trek, which Mr. Abrams directed as well. Fringe began as a cross between the X-Files and Alias, featuring a monster of the week story in addition to the overarching story lines about Walter’s past.</p>
<p>I’ve written of my love of all things J.J. Abrams before, and Fringe has a number of parallels with Alias. The show has had a couple of reboots similar to Alias, but where Alias focused solely on Sidney over its 5 year run, Fringe has morphed from being Olivia’s show, to a show about the father / son relationship between Walter and Peter. Like J.J. Abrams biggest show, Lost, before it, Fringe is also at its heart, a show about love.</p>
<p>Since the end of Lost, Fringe has been my favorite show, far and away, on television. I’m sad to see it end tonight, but I have to give kudos to Fox for sticking with it as long as they did amid struggling ratings (but a rabid fan base). Fox has released a two minute trailer for the series finale and it will be fun to watch Fringe wrap up its various storylines, but sad at the same time.</p>

<p>If you’re not, you should be. Dave Pell curates the top 10 news items of the day, just for you, delivered straight to your inbox. Yup, it’s delivered via email, quite old school. Mr. Pell spends each morning for 3-4 hours browsing the web (no RSS reader for him!) and puts together the best stories to share and adds his own unique commentary to each of them. Some of the stories may have two or three different links each and give you a new perspective on what is going on in the world around you.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.mailchimp.com/how-dave-pell-curates-the-news/">MailChimp blog recently featured a story on NextDraft</a>, discussing how Mr. Pell finds his sources links, reviews what he should include in each day’s edition, and shares that he hasn’t made a dollar from NextDraft.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That humanity comes through in the newsletter, in that the very same human who chooses and writes about that daily content also answers for it. “I do think one of the things about email that people respond to, and that makes it different from a blog, is that because it comes from my personal email address and lands in your inbox, there’s something a little more intimate about it,” he says. “If somebody wants to say something about my newsletter, they just hit ‘reply,’ it comes to me, and I’ll respond to them. It’s a little bit of a closer connection than just having a website.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NextDraft features news from the serious, with stories shared about the recent election, coverage of the Newtown shootings, as well as pop culture, such as the video below, featuring a timeline of all the pop culture references in Quentin Tarantino’s films. The best part isn’t just getting the most interesting news from around the web, but also getting Dave Pell’s unique commentary on each story.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you <a href="http://nextdraft.com/">subscribe to the email newsletter or download the new iOS app</a> to get your daily dose of the best curated news on the web. And don’t forget to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/davepell">Dave Pell on Twitter</a>, too.</p>

            <description>Photo by fireflythegreatunder a CC-BY 2.0 licenseJust before Christmas, I visited my local gaming store with the intent of buying the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Basic Set to play with the kids over the holiday break. It was time to step up from RPGKids, which I started with the kids a year or two ago. I’m a terrible Dungeon Master and lack creativity, so one of the things I was excited about in buying a set was that I’d be able to buy modules to help create the adventures for the kids.</description>

<p>Just before Christmas, I visited my <a href="http://phantasyhobbies.com/">local gaming store</a> with the intent of buying the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set to play with the kids over the holiday break. It was time to step up from RPGKids, which I started with the kids a year or two ago. I’m a terrible Dungeon Master and lack creativity, so one of the things I was excited about in buying a set was that I’d be able to buy modules to help create the adventures for the kids.</p>
<p><a href="http://phantasyhobbies.com/">Phantasy Hobbies</a> was out of the D&amp;D red box and the owner asked me if I had heard of Pathfinder, which is a continuation of the AD&amp;D 3.5 rules after Wizards of the Coast had moved on to 4.0 rules. Pathfinder had bought the license to the 3.5 ruleset and created an ecosystem to let the 3.5 rules live on. I went home that night and read up on Pathfinder and found the <a href="http://paizo.com/beginnerbox">Pathfinder Beginner Box</a>, with a limited and easier to use ruleset, would work perfectly to play with the little ones. The next day I returned to my local gaming store and bought the Beginner Box. One of the best features of Pathfinder is how much content they make available via PDF, both free and paid. I was able to pick up a module that continues the first adventure in the Beginner Box, among other things.</p>
<p>This morning I came across on Twitter a link to the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-a-fantasy-sandbox-mmo">Pathfinder MMO</a>, which is being bootstrapped on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a>. Today’s the last day and they’re 90% of the way to their goal. Set to launch in about two years, the Pathfinder MMO is built on the Unity engine and will be available for both Windows and Mac. The last thing I need is another MMO in my life, but even at the $35 level which gets you the game, the addons are worth it. They’ve thrown in the PDF of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, and the Guide to the River Kingdoms sourcebook, which is worth about $25 by itself.</p>
<p>If you’re into roleplaying, help support ’em – it’s a good cause.</p>

            <description>When NFL Network first launched, they once had a segment with Jim Fassell, the former head coach of the New York Giants. In the segment, he shows a standard offensive formation, with two tight ends, two wide receivers, a fullback and running back. He then shows the defensive formation and explains what each offensive player is supposed to do based on how the defense lines up. If a defensive cornerback plays a shallow zone (say in a standard Tampa 2 offense) the wide receiver goes long.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When NFL Network first launched, they once had a segment with Jim Fassell, the former head coach of the New York Giants. In the segment, he shows a standard offensive formation, with two tight ends, two wide receivers, a fullback and running back. He then shows the defensive formation and explains what each offensive player is supposed to do based on how the defense lines up. If a defensive cornerback plays a shallow zone (say in a standard Tampa 2 offense) the wide receiver goes long. But if a linebacker is playing man coverage on the tight end, then the wide receiver switches and runs a different route. He went through about a dozen different permutations and I came away with a new respect for the intelligence required by the players. (Unfortunately I was unable to find a clip online). We have a tendency to think about athletes, especially football players, as “dumb jocks”, but when you break down plays like Coach Fassell did in this example, it highlights how smart they have to be – and how quickly they need to react.</p>
<p>If you want to improve your football intelligence, you need to be reading Chris B. Brown. He has a special ability to write about football, its different concepts, and the history and evolution of play calling in an easy to understand manner. Mr. Brown writes about both college and profesional football on his blog at <a href="http://smartfootball.com/" title="Smart Football">SmartFootball.com</a>. He also links from there to his longer form pieces he writes for <a href="http://www.grantland.com/contributor/_/name/chris-brown">ESPN’s Grantland</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, he has written a book, suprisingly called, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0085XSN26/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrisbrownsfo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0085XSN26" title="The Essential Smart Football">The Essential Smart Football</a></em>. Available at Amazon, the Kindle edition is only $2.99, and I highly recommend it. Each chapter is dedicated to a concept, and here are just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 3-3-5 Defense: A Story of Innovation (and Desperation)</li>
<li>How Rex Ryan created the new look New England Patriots offense</li>
<li>Dick Lebeau, Dom Capers, and the Evolution of Defense</li>
<li>Football and Decision Making</li>
<li>The Constraint Theory of Offense</li>
<li>Gary Kubiak, Alex Gibbs, and the Greatest Run Play in Modern Football</li>
</ul>
<p>Each chapter is easily digestible, and the book is easy to pick up and set down. Mr. Brown writes in an easy to understand way, and even football fans who don’t know the difference between the I-formation and trip rights can pick this up and learn something.</p>
<p>It’s a $3 well spent and his blog and writing on Grantland is something I come back to again and again.</p>

            <description>Amazon made a splash this morning by announcing that they are now offering MP3s of albums you buy on CD – for free. But the even bigger surprise was that if you had purchased a CD from them going back to 1998(!), and it’s one of the 50,000 albums in their catalog that features AutoRip, they automatically added that album to your Amazon Cloud Player.
It was quite a pleasant surprise to wake up to find about 30 albums added to my Cloud Player, especially the Pearl Jam Twenty soundtrack, which features a number of different artists, which I could never seem to get ripped properly with the right artist names.</description>

<p>Amazon has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/?node=5946775011&amp;tag=lifehackeramzn-20">three videos up on the AutoRip page</a>, including an overview, how to, and a video about Cloud Player.</p>
<p>I don’t know how much (or if) they’re paying the labels for this service, but I love it. I still like my shiny discs, especially from my core favorite artists, and this is a great service to provide (even if it a shrinking business). I buy most of new music on vinyl these days, and since I started collecting vinyl a few years, almost every vinyl album has come with an MP3 download card.</p>
<p>Now I can’t wait for the day I buy a book and can get the ebook…</p>

After starting a new job in early 2012 that had a lot of travel, I “borrowed” one of his Lego Stormtrooper Minifigs who needed a vacation from the daily grind of the Empire.

My wife tells me Jack giggles when he sees the updates, which makes it all worth it.</description>

I tried to condense the list to a top 10, but I just couldn’t do it. I’m not going to do a major review of each one – there are plenty of sites out there from Paste to Pitchfork that can give you more information on the artists and albums below.</description>

<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/7303956772/" title="Untitled by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>Japandroids – Celebration Rock – Released on one of my favorite labels, <a href="http://www.polyvinylrecords.com/">Polyvinyl</a>, Japandroids rock the house and don’t stop the whole album. As I trained for some 5k races this summer, I listened to this over and over again.</li>
<li>Bob Mould – Silver Age – Bob Mould returns to early 90’s form with a rocking album reminiscent of his early solo work and with Sugar. (And the two Sugar re-issues are awesome!) The best concert I saw this year, with Bob playing Sugar’s Copper Blue in its entirety followed by songs from Silver Age and songs from his whole career.</li>
<li>Divine Fits – A Thing Called Divine Fits – This supergroup with members from Spoon and Wolf Parade nailed it.</li>
<li>Father John Misty – Fear Fun – I loved this album and my wife hated it as I made her listen to it non-stop on a drive to Milwaukee. Haunting, with beautiful lyrics.</li>
<li>Metric – Synthetica – Metric follows-up their 2009 smash album Fantasies with a return that is slightly darker.</li>
<li>RNDM – Acts – Another “supergroup”, featuring Joseph Arthur and Pearl Jam’s Jeff Ament. Jeff Ament challenged Joseph Arthur to write some up tempo songs, and they delivered.</li>
<li>Poliça – Give You the Ghost – This Minneapolis band (almost a local supergroup) exploded on to the scene in Minneapolis in 2011 and quickly built a national following. The formal release date for the album was Valentine’s Day 2012, but they dropped it digitally in December 2011. Channy’s vocals, combined with the only use of autotune I’ve ever liked, are a breath of fresh air. The beats by two drummers are unique and this is probably my album of the year.</li>
<li>A.C. Newman – Shut Down the Streets – The frontman for the New Pornographers releases another solo record – if you’re a fan of his solo or New Pornographers work, you’ll love it. Nothing new, but it works.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/6953232818/" title="The Shins - Port of Morrow by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>The Shins – Port of Morrow – Even with an all new band backing James Mercer up, the sound is the same. Again, like A.C. Newman above, nothing new but it works.</li>
<li>P.O.S. – We Don’t Even Live Here – The Minneapolis rapper explodes on his latest album. There wasn’t a better hip-hop record released last year. Here is to hoping his upcoming kidney transplant goes well – <a href="http://www.youcaring.com/medical-fundraiser/stef-needs-a-new-kidney/25576">you can help here</a>.</li>
<li>JD McPherson – Signs and Signifiers – I love rockabilly and JD McPherson resurrects a lost art form.</li>
<li>Django Django – Django Django – The one album I can’t describe – but I know what I like.</li>
<li>Ladyhawke – Anxiety – Another album I listened to while running and one of my favorites to chill to on a long plane ride.</li>
<li>Stagnant Pools – Temporary Room – Another Polyvinyl release, this duo of brothers out of Indiana have a throwback sound in the vein of Joy Division or The Jesus and Mary Chain.</li>
</ul>

            <description>Welcome to the revamped paulcutler.org.
I’m your host, Paul. With January upon us, the blog has officially turned 10(!). One of my New Years resolutions is to blog more – I only blogged twice last year, but I can’t tell you the number of ideas I had for blog posts that I saved in Evernote, Google Reader or Pocket / Instapaper. This year I hope to follow through on that a bit more.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the revamped paulcutler.org.</p>
<p>I’m your host, Paul. With January upon us, the blog has officially turned 10(!). One of my New Years resolutions is to blog more – I only blogged twice last year, but I can’t tell you the number of ideas I had for blog posts that I saved in Evernote, Google Reader or Pocket / Instapaper. This year I hope to follow through on that a bit more.</p>
<p>With the blog’s ten year anniversary here, I went back and looked through some of the old blog posts – and quickly wished I hadn’t. Maybe that’s not fair, but I believe my writing style has improved since I first created the blog. The blog has gone through a number of iterations – first as a place to share whatever I wanted, including technology, digital rights, sports, or gaming. Later, as I became more involved with open source projects, the blog became a place to share news or thoughts about the projects I was involved with. As I became less involved, and with the rise of Twitter, the blog posts tapered off.</p>
<p>I plan to go back to the original premise and share my thoughts and interests on technology, digital rights, tabletop games and anything else that might come to mind. I’ll share interesting links from around the web – some you may already have seen and others may be new to you.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’ll be talking about music. I’ve always been an avid music fan, but a few years ago I bought my first turntable and got into vinyl in a big way. I started a music blog, which also has suffered from a lack of posts in the last year. I’ll be combining the blogs and only using the blog at paulcutler.org going forward, so this is also where I’ll be talking about music.</p>
<p>In preparation for 2013, I’ve spent some time re-designing the <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org" title="paulcutler.org">home page</a> and the blog. But we’ll save that for another post. You have to have a reason to want to come back, right?</p>

            <description>I saw this posted on Boing Boing last month and forgot how great it was until Amanda Palmer linked to it in her latest Kickstarter update.
I love how much fun Amanda Palmer and her band are having jamming with David Byrne – and it’s great to see him playing an old Talking Heads tune.
Enjoy.

            <description>Welcome back!
July 25th is a big day for new music. If you’re not reading the Largeheartedboy blog for new music releases, including where you can stream the new releases for free before buying (which usually comes out on Wednesdays), you should be. The list of today’s releases can be found here.
Albums I’ve purchased this week include:
Passion Pit’s Gossamer: If you’re a fan of the first album, you’ll love their second album.</description>

<p>July 25th is a big day for new music. If you’re not reading the Largeheartedboy blog for new music releases, including where you can stream the new releases for free before buying (which usually comes out on Wednesdays), you should be. The list of today’s releases can be <a href="http://www.largeheartedboy.com/blog/archive/2012/07/this_weeks_inte_606.html">found here</a>.</p>
<p>Albums I’ve purchased this week include:</p>
<p>Passion Pit’s Gossamer: If you’re a fan of the first album, you’ll love their second album. Not a lot has changed since their breakthrough debut album Manners. The same upbeat tempo, falsetto – a great summer album.</p>
<p>[https://rd.io/i/QAAKPlkiMQ]</p>
<p>The next album I’ll be listening to is the latest from The Gaslight Anthem, Handwritten. I haven’t given it a spin, but the first single, 45, released a while back shows the New Jersey rockers haven’t changed much from their last few releases. If you’re a fan of good old-fashioned rock and roll, give it a listen. The vinyl is available from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Handwritten-The-Gaslight-Anthem/dp/B0089IGUKO/ref=tmm_vnl_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343133841&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon for only $13.99</a>!</p>
<p>[https://rd.io/i/QAAKPlksjw]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.polyvinylrecords.com/artists/index.php?id=1020">Stagnant Pools</a> release their debut album on Polyvinyl today. One of the things I love about Polyvinyl is they often give you the digital release weeks before the physical albums come out. I’ve given this a few spins, and their artist page sums them up quite well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stagnant Pools are Bryan and Douglass Enas, two brothers (21 and 22) from Bloomington, Indiana. With just one guitar and a drum kit, they make music which the Chicago Reader describes as “drone-heavy, slate-gray art-rock that should appeal to fans of Disappears, Joy Division, and Sonic Youth records from back when they were still actually scary.”</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Lastly, Bob Mould of Hüsker Dü and Sugar fame, has signed on with the ultimate indie label Merge for his <a href="http://www.mergerecords.com/store/store_detail.php?catalog_id=877">upcoming solo release</a>. Before that comes out, he has remastered and <a href="http://www.mergerecords.com/store/store_search.php?band_id=239">re-released the Sugar catalog today on Merge</a>. Featuring the first album, Copper Blue, along with the Beaster EP as well as the follow-up File Under Listening, they are available from Merge with a bonus content featuring live songs and B-sides on MP3, CD or vinyl.</p>
<p>[https://rd.io/i/QAAKPloMjQ]</p>
<p>[https://rd.io/i/QAAKPloMjA]</p>
<p>I’ve ordered all of the above albums on vinyl and am looking forward to giving them a spin.</p>

            <description>Alan Moore talk to The Guardian about V for Vendetta and the use of the Guy Fawkes mask he created for V for Vendetta and its use by Occupy.
 It is an irony noted with relish by critics of the protests – one also glumly acknowledged by many of the protesters – that the purchase of so many _Vendetta _masks has become a lucrative little side-earner for Time Warner, the media company that owns the rights to Moore’s creation.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/nov/27/alan-moore-v-vendetta-mask-protest?">Alan Moore talk to The Guardian</a> about V for Vendetta and the use of the Guy Fawkes mask he created for V for Vendetta and its use by Occupy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is an irony noted with relish by critics of the protests – one also glumly acknowledged by many of the protesters – that the purchase of so many _Vendetta _masks has become a lucrative little side-earner for Time Warner, the media company that owns the rights to Moore’s creation. Efforts have been made to avoid feeding the conglomerate more cash, the Anonymous group reportedly starting to <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2098702,00.html" title="">import masks</a> direct from factories in China to circumvent corporate pockets; last year, demonstrators at a “Free Julian Assange” event in Madrid wore cardboard replicas, apparently self-made. But more than 100,000 of the £4-£7 masks sell every year, according to the manufacturers, with a cut always going to Time Warner. Does that irk Moore?</p>
<p>“I find it comical, watching Time Warner try to walk this precarious tightrope.” Through contacts in the comics industry, he explains, he has heard that boosted sales of the masks have become a troubling issue for the company. “It’s a bit embarrassing to be a corporation that seems to be profiting from an anti-corporate protest. It’s not really anything that they want to be associated with. And yet they really don’t like turning down money – it goes against all of their instincts.” Moore chuckles. “I find it more funny than irksome.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, poor Time Warner and your moral dilemmas.  If only that was the least of your troubles.</p>

            <description>A co-worker introduced me to rpgKids last week. After taking a look around the website, I plunked down the $5 and bought the game and the adventure pack and it was well worth the money.
rpgKids is a basic roleplaying game meant to introduce kids ages 4-7 to the wonderful world of using their imagination to roleplay. The 24 page PDF includes the ruleset, an overview of the characters, hand drawn tokens for both heroes and monsters, a character sheet and a printable 1″ grid for mapping your adventures.</description>

<p>rpgKids is a basic roleplaying game meant to introduce kids ages 4-7 to the wonderful world of using their imagination to roleplay.  The 24 page PDF includes the ruleset, an overview of the characters, hand drawn tokens for both heroes and monsters, a character sheet and a printable 1″ grid for mapping your adventures.  It also comes with with one adventure for you to run through with the kids, and the Adventure Pack (if you buy the $5 version) includes 4 more adventures.  The age recommendation was perfect, as Zoe is 7 and Jack is 5.</p>
<p>I packed up the kids Saturday morning and we headed out to our <a href="http://phoenixgamesonline.com/">local game store</a>.  While you don’t need to, we picked up a bunch of used miniatures for $2 bucks each for the game.  The tokens included in the PDF would have worked fine, but I wanted to give the kids that little extra experience.  We also picked up some dice – you’ll need a couple D12 and D6 dice for the game – I made sure to get each of the kids their own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/6269677843/" title="SDC10802 by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>The included adventure gives you the overview of the story, a script to follow (if you choose) and 4 encounters, including maps, where you’ll run into the “monsters” as you try to save the town of Springwell.</p>
<p>The kids choose their class (fighter, healer, wizard or archer) and you as the parent play the role of Dungeon Master, keeping the kids on path in the story and role playing the monsters in each encounter.  The kids had a blast as I roleplayed the monsters, especially the funny voices, and added to the script to make sure they were having a good time.</p>
<p>Zoe got it right away – she quickly named her character as they filled out their character sheets and chose a class, while Jack didn’t really get it until we were in the middle of the story and having our first encounter with the monsters.  Alex, who is 15, came and watched – as my wife later pointed out, you could tell that he thought he was too cool to play with the little kids, but deep down, he really wanted to.</p>
<p>Combat is simple – roll a die for initiative, then the monsters roll against the heroes to see if there is a “hit” – 2 hits and the character or monster is knocked out.  Depending on the class, you can attack from so many tiles away, adding a level of tactics and strategy to start the kids learning.  My Dungeon Master skills are a bit rusty, but thankfully the script kept the story going and I embellished and added to the story where appropriate.</p>
<p>They definitely enjoyed it and were asking to play again – this will definitely be a great way to get through the long Minnesota winter.  If you have a kids, I highly recommend <a href="http://newbiedm.com/rpgkids/">rpgKids</a> and it definitely lays the groundwork to introduce D&amp;D when they get older.  Who needs video games anyway?!</p>

            <description>The internet is buzzing with thank you’s, tributes and more about the passing of Steve Jobs yesterday.
I was 11 or 12 when we got our second computer – the brand new Apple //c. A portable version of the Apple IIe, for the first time in the Apple II line it included a built in 5.25 disk drive and ports for a mouse / joystick, external disc drive, modem and more.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The internet is buzzing with thank you’s, tributes and more about the <a href="http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/">passing of Steve Jobs</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>I was 11 or 12 when we got our second computer – the brand new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_iic">Apple //c</a>.  A portable version of the Apple IIe, for the first time in the Apple II line it included a built in 5.25 disk drive and ports for a mouse / joystick, external disc drive, modem and more.</p>
<p>It was on this computer that my formative years were spent – learning BASIC, LOGO, messing with Apple Paint, and playing Choplifter, Bards Tale and Lode Runner (among others) for hours (and days) at time.  Lode Runner was the first game I played where I could create my own levels and I would spend days devising clever ways to trap that little guy.</p>
<p>Most importantly, this was the computer that got me online.  We had a 300 baud modem, and later purchased a 1200 and then 2400 baud modem which seemed liked the fastest thing ever.  I remember begging my dad to let me spend more time on CompuServe, back when it cost $6 / hour to be on the service, just so I could play text adventure games.</p>
<p>Later I would discover the wonderful world of BBSes, and play games online, download software and interact with online communities, all while tying up the one phone line we had in the house.</p>
<p>Almost 10 years ago I bought an Apple //c on Ebay, which has sat in my closet since.  Ironically, two weeks ago I decided to pull it out and hook it up, only to realize I didn’t buy any software.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/6215829565/" title="SDC10798 by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It wouldn’t be until years later that I would buy an Apple product again.  This past January, frustrated with my PC for not playing MP3s out of the blue, I grabbed my wife in the middle of a snowstorm and we drove to the Apple store.  User her education discount, I bought an iMac and was blown away by the experience – both the shopping experience at an Apple store and OS X.  <em>It just worked</em>.  I can’t say I’m a fan of iTunes, but thankfully Banshee is available on OS X.  Using iMovie, I was able to quickly jump in and edit my home movie footage from Christmas.  I imported my photos into iPhoto and quickly and intuitively created a photo book for my wife for our 15th wedding anniversary.  Apple’s focus on making products easy to use is phenomenal.</p>
<p>In April, I bought an iPad, and over the summer bought the new MacBook Air.  Apple’s combination of software and amazing hardware is a combination that no one can match.  Having worked with Apple when the original iMac was first launched, their business practices can leave something to be desired – but they do everything for one reason – their focus on the customer experience trumps everything, and it shows in the products they bring to market.</p>
<p>And the focus started with Steve Jobs, and for that I’m thankful.</p>

            <description>If you grew up in the 80s like me, especially as a teenager, Ready Player One is a book for you.
For fans of retro arcade games, 80s music and movies, MMOs, cyberpunk, roleplaying and early computers like the TRS-80, it weaves them all into a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I can’t do it justice, so read the summary here. And then buy it and read it, you won’t be disappointed.</description>

            <description>This Friday, my son and I are going to the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul to see the season finale of Minnesota Public Radio’s Wits series. Each performance features an interview with a cultural icon, a musical guest and other guests. I purchased tickets for this one specifically because of the featured guest: Neil Gaiman. Mr. Gaiman is touring in support of the tenth anniversary of his first novel, the class American Gods.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Friday, my son and I are going to the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul to see the season finale of <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/programs/wits/">Minnesota Public Radio’s Wits series</a>. Each performance features an interview with a cultural icon, a musical guest and other guests. I purchased tickets for this one specifically because of the featured guest: <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/">Neil Gaiman</a>. Mr. Gaiman is touring in support of the tenth anniversary of his first novel, the class <em>American Gods</em>.</p>
<p>I vividly remember the first time I read <em>American Gods</em>. I knew of Neil Gaiman through his groundbreaking comic, <em>Sandman</em>, but <em>American Gods</em> blew me away. I remember thinking, “<em>How does this Englishman know of all these Midwest landmarks?!</em>” And when they stopped at a Culvers just outside of Madison… It wasn’t until a few years later than I learned he had relocated to Wisconsin, not too far from the Minnesota border. The book’s take on mythology and its plot quickly made it a classic.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to see Neil Gaiman speak and do a book signing a few years ago when his last collection of short stories, <em>Fragile Things</em>, was published. He’s an engaging speaker and listening to him read from his stories is a thrill in itself. (I also won the raffle in support of the CBLDF):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/276164059/" title="DSC00872 by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>This week’s musical guess is Josh Ritter and the hosts are John Moe of MPR and <a href="http://www.thenewstandards.com/munson.html">John Munson</a>. Mr. Munson was formerly in the bands Trip Shakespeare and Semisonic. Back in (probably) 1994, for the only time in my life, I won concert tickets on the radio from <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/about/people/mpr_people_display.php?aut_id=121">Mary Lucia</a> at <a href="http://www.pessimistic.com/revolution/radio.htm">Rev105</a> to see a showcase of Minnesota acts at <a href="http://first-avenue.com/">First Avenue</a>. One band in particular, Pleasure, just blew me away – it was one of the tightest bands I’ve ever seen, and I didn’t know a single song. I moved out east and never heard about the band again. A year or two later, a friend from the Twin Cities moved out east to work with me, and I asked him about Pleasure. He excitedly informed me they had changed their name to Semisonic and I bought their debut album the same day. (You probably know them from their big hit, <em>Closing Time</em>).</p>
<p>In addition, guests at Wits this week appearing via the phone include Wil Wheaton, Adam Savage, <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/programs/wits/">and more</a>.</p>
<p>Can’t wait – both for the show and to introduce my son to seeing Neil Gaiman live.</p>

            <description>One of the things I’ve been enjoying as I took a blogging break (that’s over, I swear!) is enjoying Album Club. What is Album Club, you ask? Every Tuesday night at 9 p.m. CDT, listeners gather on Twitter and listen to the same album and tweet their thoughts, remembrances and more about the album. The tweets range from information about the recording of the album to humor to scathing criticism.</description>

<p>One of the things I’ve been enjoying as I took a blogging break (that’s over, I swear!) is enjoying Album Club. What is Album Club, you ask? Every Tuesday night at 9 p.m. CDT, listeners gather on Twitter and listen to the same album and tweet their thoughts, remembrances and more about the album. The tweets range from information about the recording of the album to humor to scathing criticism.</p>
<p>The album is picked out a few days before and announced on the <a href="http://therealalbumclub.blogspot.com/">Album Club blog</a>. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/album_club">Album Club on Twitter</a> as well as the #albumclub hashtag and at 9pm Tuesdays the tweets roll in!</p>
<p>Album Club is hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/stevenelsonmn">Steve Nelson</a>, former morning co-host at Rev105 in the 90’s, former music director at 8<a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/the_current/">9.3 The Current</a>, and now news director at <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/features/">Minnesota Public Radio</a>. Mr. Nelson picks the albums and hosts the session each Tuesday. Since Album Club started in April, the albums listened to and tweeted about include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pixies – Doolittle</li>
<li>Radiohead – OK Computer</li>
<li>Bjork – Post</li>
<li>Prince and the Revolution – Purple Rain (hosted live Aster Cafe)</li>
<li>Marvin Gaye – What’s Going On</li>
<li>Fleetwood Mac – Rumours</li>
</ul>
<p>Last night’s Rumours session was guest curated by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/johnmoe">John Moe</a> – and a good time was had by all as Mr. Moe shared background on the album, the challenges Fleetwood Mac was going through when they recorded this classic, and his disdain for Christine McVie.</p>
<p>See you Tuesdays at 9pm!</p>

To those of you I worked with and didn’t get a chance to say goodbye to yesterday, it was a pleasure working with you.

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is the ninth anniversary of the day Alice in Chains lead singer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layne_Staley">Layne Staley</a>, was found dead in his Seattle apartment. Layne had been dead for two weeks, dying of a heroin and cocaine overdose on April 5th, 2002.</p>
<p>I saw Alice in Chains twice growing up. The first time was in a small club, the Eagles Ballroom, opening, believe it or not, for Extreme in the fall of 1990. The show was terrible. We got there early as we usually did, and the club was fairly empty as Alice in Chains took the stage. Grunge wasn’t mainstream yet and the Seattle explosion was still six months away from taking over the airwaves. Standing five feet away from the band, we could see that Layne was high as a kite – I vividly remember seeing how dilated his eyes were and as he growled out the lyrics to their first album, the crowd eventually booed them off the stage while we waited for the hair metal headliner Extreme to take the stage.</p>
<p>A couple years later I saw Alice in Chains open for Van Halen at the Marcus Amphitheater. The show wasn’t much better, though the crowd at least knew who Alice in Chains was. As much as I loved the grunge movement, being an early fan of Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and more, Alice in Chains was one band I just couldn’t get into because of the bad taste in my mouth from seeing them perform so poorly early in their career.</p>
<p>When Cameron Crowe’s second movie, Singles, came out, Alice in Chains was prominent as the live act in the club the main characters go to. I remember watching the concert footage and not being able to reconcile that this powerful show that was depicted in the movie was not the experience I had had in seeing Alice in Chains perform live twice.</p>
<p>In 1995, Mad Season’s Deceit album was released. Featuring Layne Staley on vocals, Mike McMcready of Pearl Jam and Barrett Martin of Screaming Trees, the album was a hit. I loved this album and didn’t even realize at the time that it was Layne Staley singing.</p>
<p>About five or six years ago, a co-worker who is a good friend of mine were reminiscing about our favorite bands from the grunge days. She loved Alice in Chains – I shared this story with her and she was shocked at how much I disliked Alice in Chains. On her advice, I gave them another try, and listened to Alice in Chains again, this time focusing on the music and putting my preconceived notion and memories out of my head.</p>
<p>And she was right – Alice in Chains was a great band who we lost before their time. Another example of drugs taking another artist before their time.</p>
<p>In Layne Staley’s memory, I’ll be listening to some Alice in Chains today.</p>

Rock the Garden, 89.3 The Current’s annual outdoor show in partnership with the Walker Arts Center, is just under two weeks form announcing which artists will be playing to a sold out crowd in Minneapolis. The Current will be announcing the lineup on April 19th.
The boys over at Reviler take a look at who they think may be playing at Rock The Garden. With such categories as “Best Guess”, “Awesome Long Shot” and “Most Terrifying Prospect”.</description>

            <description>LCD Soundsystem played its last show last night at Madison Square Garden. James Murphy made being a DJ cool again in the last 10 years and brought a rock sound and beats to his electronic music that made it sound both familiar and new at the same time. I remember the first time I heard Daft Punk is Playing in My House from their first self-titled album – a lyric to this day, that if I hear it, is stuck in my head for days at a time.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LCD Soundsystem played its last show last night at Madison Square Garden. James Murphy made being a DJ cool again in the last 10 years and brought a rock sound and beats to his electronic music that made it sound both familiar and new at the same time. I remember the first time I heard <em>Daft Punk is Playing in My House</em> from their first self-titled album – a lyric to this day, that if I hear it, is stuck in my head for days at a time.</p>
<p>With LCD Soundsystem coming to an end, <a href="http://blogs.westword.com/backbeat/2011/04/why_lcd_soundsystem_mattered.php">Thorin Klosowski at the Denver Post takes a look</a> at what makes LCD Soundsystem so relevant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, the majority of rock kids in 2002 were still scared of electronic music. For all its bells and whistles, the things it embodied, ecstasy, dancing, beats — all of those things were dangerous. But that was what was so startling and ultimately rewarding about LCD Soundsystem. It wasn’t dance music, not like Crystal Method or Moby or even Daft Punk was; it was electronic music made by a guy who liked ’70s and ’80s rock. It was also being made by a guy in his thirties, for kids in their twenties, and that meant the dream of never really growing up was truly a reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire concert from the last show was posted online at Youtube, but seems to have been taken down now. With that, I’ll leave you with <em>All My Friends</em> from LCD Soundsystem’s last show.</p>

            <description>Scientific American dips into it’s archives looking at an article originally published in 1919 discussing needles on the “new” phonograph:
 At the time of this article’s publication, July 5, 1919, the phonograph had only been a household item for 10 to 15 years. While it was still considered a novel invention, persons such as F.D. Hall of Chicago began looking for ways to improve upon it—specifically its sound quality.</description>

<p>Scientific American dips into it’s archives <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=the-ultimate-edition-to-your-vintag-2011-03-22">looking at an article originally published in 1919</a> discussing needles on the “new” phonograph:</p>

<p>At the time of this article’s publication, July 5, 1919, the phonograph had only been a household item for 10 to 15 years. While it was still considered a novel invention, persons such as F.D. Hall of Chicago began looking for ways to improve upon it—specifically its sound quality. The phonograph made “tinny” and “harsh sounds,” and was also described as being “unduly loud.” Further, the metal needle often wore down the records after a short while.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to share the story and pictures of using and manufacturing bamboo as a record needle. As the article points out at the end, we now use mostly diamonds in our needles. To think how far we’ve come…</p>

            <title>Which is better – support the artists or the indie stores?</title>

            <description>Since I started collecting vinyl records again last year, I’ve pre-ordered a number of new albums directly from the artist’s website. I’ve often advocated for what Techdirt calls “Cwf + Rtb” – Connect with Fans + Reason to buy = $$$.
As the music industry sees declining sales, if you can connect with your fans on an individual level and give them a reason to buy, you will see revenue. This works in music and, as Cory Doctorow is proving, works in the book industry as well.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I started collecting vinyl records again last year, I’ve pre-ordered a number of new albums directly from the artist’s website. I’ve often advocated for what Techdirt calls “<a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090719/2246525598.shtml">Cwf + Rtb</a>” – Connect with Fans + Reason to buy = $$$.</p>
<p>As the music industry sees declining sales, if you can connect with your fans on an individual level and give them a reason to buy, you will see revenue. This works in music and, as <a href="http://craphound.com/walh/">Cory Doctorow is proving</a>, works in the book industry as well.</p>
<p>In the music industry, concerts are usually pointed out as the best example of this. A number of artists, from the Grateful Dead years ago, to their modern day replacements in Phish (when they were active) or David Mathews Band, constantly tour, and mix up their set lists nightly to give their fans a unique experience.</p>
<p>This has also carried over in to new releases. <a href="http://jennyandjohnnymusic.com/">Jenny and Johnny</a>‘s 2010 album, I’m Having Fun Now, offered a unique deluxe package. For $40, you received the new album on CD, vinyl, MP3 and cassette. You also received three limited edition 7″ records with singles from the album, one of which was autographed. Ben Folds and Nick Hornby’s collaboration, <a href="http://benfolds.com/lonelyavenue">Lonely Avenue</a>, offered a couple of different packages. One package included the album on vinyl, CD and MP3 and came with a limited edition piece of sheet music randomly chosen from one of the songs on the album. They also offered a deluxe package that featured the CD along with a book of photos and prose from Nick Hornby. The Decemberists new album, <a href="http://www.decemberists.com/">The King is Dead out January 18th</a>, is available in a $165 package and includes the following goodies: a one of a kind photograph, hardcover book of photos, white vinyl, a video, MP3 and more – and is only one of 2500.</p>
<p>But what does that mean for the independent music stores which continue to dwindle? The artists are doing a great job of connecting with their fans and giving them a reason to buy – direct. How can the indie stores compete with that? The indie stores, obviously, need to connect with their fans as well. <a href="http://www.recordstoreday.com">Record Store Day</a> continues to connect artists with indie stores, giving the stores exclusive music to sell, now twice a year. Three indie record stores I’ve visited in the past few months each have a different value proposition from each other as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.disclandonline.com">Discland</a> (Bloomington, MN): New vinyl, used (vinyl, cassette, CD), <strong>video games</strong></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Down in the Valley<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Golden Valley, MN): New vinyl, used (vinyl, cassette, CD), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->head shop and accessories<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Exclusive-Company/187786103112">The Exclusive Company</a> (Various locations, Wisconsin): New vinyl, used (vinyl, cassette, CD), new CDs, new and used movies (and competitively priced compared to the big box retailers)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was happy to see that Discland was packed this past Saturday.  There were a ton of people in the store, shopping in each section.  They had lots of help on hand, who were friendly and would ask if I needed help.  I’ve had similar experiences at Down in the Valley as well, though not as usually crowded.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I don’t know what the right answer is – I like collecting things, especially limited editions.  I try and support my local indie shops when I can, but I can’t fault the artists for doing what they’re doing either. But I do have guilt, especially when I buy from Amazon, and to a lesser degree, directly from the artist. (But there is something to be said for not leaving the house, especially in the middle of a Minnesota winter!)</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Where do you prefere to shop?</p>

            <description>I had an interesting week in music this last week.
I started the week taking advantage of Amazon’s $5.00 MP3 albums and picked up two celebrated releases from Minneapolis bands:
 Gayngs – Relayted: This new Minneapolis 23 member supergroup, featuring members of Bon Iver, Solid Gold and rapper P.O.S, creates a unique sound that is guaranteed to mellow you out. Perfect msuic to play in the background while cooking or reading, Gayngs will relax and soothe you.</description>

<p>I started the week taking advantage of Amazon’s $5.00 MP3 albums and picked up two celebrated releases from Minneapolis bands:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gayngs – Relayted: This new Minneapolis 23 member  supergroup, featuring members of Bon Iver, Solid Gold and rapper P.O.S, creates a unique sound that is guaranteed to mellow you out.  Perfect msuic to play in the background while cooking or reading, Gayngs will relax and soothe you.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.com/B003F44112">Trampled by Turtles – Palomino</a>: I’ve said it a few times before, but especially after Mumford and Sons exploded on the scene, is that indie rock needs more banjos and fiddles.  Trampled by Turtles (along with Carolina Chocolate Drop) definitely filled that quota in 2010.  Filled with catchy alt-country hooks, Palomino will get your foot tapping and, with songs averaging right around 3 minutes, you’ll be pressing play to listen to it again before you know it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hit up Discland on Saturday.  It’s been close to 6 months since I’ve been there and their used vinyl selection keeps on growing.  My main goal was to pick up some used Van Halen (which is a story for another time) and the trip was successful.</p>
<p>I was able to pick up Van Halen II, Women and Children First and Diver Down, completing my collection of David Lee Roth era Van Halen.  They also had a surprising amount of pop – usually all I find is 70s and 80s rock when visiting used record stores and, while I’m not a huge Madonna fan, I found myself buying Madonna’s True Blue and Like a Prayer albums.  Both albums take me back to my childhood and I gave them a spin on Sunday and they’re both great pop albums.  Lastly, I went back to my hair band roots, and picked up White Lion’s Pride as the last used album.  Discland also had a rare copy of Alejandro Escovedo’s 2001 re-issue, A Man Under the Influence.  One of 1000 vinyl copies pressed, I snatched that up.  His 2008 album, Real Animals, was one of my favorite albums of the year, and 2010’s Street Songs of Love was a solid release, though it didn’t crack my top 10.</p>
<ul>
<li>Polyvinyl emailed me that my D<a href="http://www.polyvinylrecords.com/store/index.php?id=1538">eerhoof vs. Evil</a> pre-order shipped on Friday and the MP3s were available for download.  I’ve given that a couple listens and I’ll put a review up once the vinyl comes.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.voxbloc.com/share/social-distortion-album-stream">Social Distortion’s Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes</a> comes out next Tuesday, January 18th, and I pre-ordered one of 1000 yellow vinyl copies.  They have yellow or red available.  I would have preferred the red, but yellow was limited to 1000 and red was limited to 2500.  I’m a sucker for “rare” and limited editions.  The long time punk rockers are also running a contest on <a href="http://www.voxbloc.com/share/social-distortion-album-stream">their website</a> – the more people who stream their new album, the lower the price will be in the Amazon MP3 store.  I’ll definitely be giving that a listen tomorrow.  I also plan to review the album once it arrives.</li>
</ul>
<p>I closed out the week today with another Minneapolis band, Tapes ‘N Tapes, new release, Outside.  My friend and former co-worker <a href="http://skavalanche.blogspot.com/2011/01/tapes-n-tapes-outside-album-review.html">Steve reviews the album here</a>, and I would agree with him.  It’s a solid B.  <a href="http://amzn.com/B004EZ3AKY">Outside is available for only $3.99 at Amazon</a> for a few more hours.</p>

            <description>Just wanted to say thanks for a couple things:
Thank you to everyone in the GNOME community who helped crowdsource editing of the 2009 Annual Report. I received a lot of comments about lots of little things we missed and I uploaded a new version of the report a week or two ago that hopefully fixes everything. (And thank you for the kind words on the look – Daniel deserves all the credit!</description>

Get ready to listen to the same annual cry from the music industry – “The sky is falling!” NPR’s music blog, The Record, has the details.
For the first time, all music sales, when adding CD, LP, cassette and digital – declined as a total. Digital tracks grew 1%.</description>

<p>Get ready to listen to the same annual cry from the music industry – “<em>The sky is falling</em>!” NPR’s music blog, The Record, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2011/01/06/132694660/2010-was-a-very-bad-year-for-trying-to-sell-music">has the details</a>.</p>
<p>For the first time, all music sales, when adding CD, LP, cassette and digital – declined as a total. Digital tracks grew 1%. One thing the article and Soundscan’s numbers don’t cover is how digital sales break down. I would have to guess that the trend of individual track sales is still growing – which continues to impact albums sold via digital. Total albums sales fell to 326 million, the lowest since 1993, a drop of 13%, which was the same decline as 2009 for total album sales.</p>
<p>NPR’s article goes on to say that the “”return of vinyl” has hit the brakes.” Contrast that with a <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/vinyl-sales-increase-despite-industry-slump-20110106">Rolling Stone article</a>, also released yesterday, whose headline says “Vinyl Sales Increase Despite Industry Slump”. So whose spin are you going to believe? After reading the NPR article, which points out how terrible the music industry is doing, I’ll take the Rolling Stone’s more positive headline. I would think the music industry and their PR flacks would want to jump on any positive news, and the fact that vinyl sales grew 14% year over year, especially when compared to the other declining numbers, is definitely a positive.</p>
<p>Total vinyl sales were the highest they’ve been since 1991, and for a format most people would consider dead, this growth should be good news to the industry, especially when you consider the average selling price for a vinyl album is significantly higher than a digital album or CD.</p>
<p>Best selling new vinyl albums, in order, for 2010 were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcade Fire – The Suburbs</li>
<li>The Black Keys – Brothers</li>
<li>Vampire Weekend – Contra</li>
<li>The National – High Violet</li>
</ul>
<p>The best selling overall vinyl album was The Beatles’ Abbey Road.</p>
<p>I believe in quality over quantity and if the record industry would focus on longevity and the quality of the artists rather than hit machines, it would be a different story.  But that’s an article for another time.</p>
<p>Here’s to another year of growth for vinyl in 2011!</p>

            <description>2010 has gone and now it’s time to share some of my favorite music of the year. Everyone has a top 10 list, so I thought I’d try something different. Well, that, and I can’t seem to whittle my list down to ten.
2010 was a great year for music. For the last few years music executives have been crying that the sky has falling as music sales decline. What they need to remember is that quality beats quantity – when they stop focusing on hit makers and on quality music and artists who will last, the sales will be there.</description>

<p>Without further adieu, and in no particular order, here is some of my favorite music from 2010:</p>
<p><strong>Best album using guest vocalists:  David Byrne &amp; Fatboy Slim:  Here Lies Love</strong> – Who ever thought that a concept album about Imelda Marcus would be made, much less be a great album?  David Byrne had been rumored to have been working on this for years, and with help from Fatboy Slim and guest vocalists including Tori Amos, Sharon Jones, Florence Welch, Santigold, Cyndi Lauper, St. Vincent, Sia and more, the album turned out great.  Check out <a href="http://www.davidbyrne.com/here_lies_love/">this image for all of the artists involved</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Best Summer Music:  (Tie) – Free Energy and Best Coast</strong> –  Free Energy is a Minneapolis born and Philadelphia band who burst on the scene this year, in part thanks to my local radio station, 89.3 The Current.  With infectious pop hooks, the single Bang Pop became one of my top earworms of the year.  Free Energy will be playing The Current’s 6th Birthday Party at First Avenue later this month.   Best Coast had the quintessential summer album that makes you want to roll down the windows, hit the gas and blare the music.  Best Coast’s California garage rock will get your foot tapping and with the average song only two and a half minutes the album will be over before you know it and you’ll be hitting the play button again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/5216094392/" title="sdc10576.jpg by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p><strong>Best cover album:  The Bird and the Bee – Interpreting the Masters Volume 1: A Tribute to Daryl Hall and John Oates</strong> –  I’ve already <a href="http://www.vinylevolution.com/?p=111">talked about this album a bit</a>, but I love the fact they went back and covered some pure 80’s pop classics.  I think you’ll be surprised how many songs you remember from your childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Best 50’s revival:  The Like – Release Me</strong> –  With a look and a sound that will instantly remind you of 50’s girl power pop, The Like hit the scene this year with some catchy songs that are modern yet take you back to a simpler time.  Listen to the title track, Release Me, as the best example.</p>
<p><strong>Best Debut Album:  Local Natives – Gorilla Manor</strong> – My friend <a href="http://skavalanche.blogspot.com/2010/12/2010-year-in-music.html">Steve’s review</a> is 10 times better than anything I could hope to write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can never get through a year without being introduced to a handful of bands who, no matter how popular with the listening public, seem to be loathed by critics (see <em>Mumford &amp; Sons</em>). Local Natives fit into this same mold, making some local bloggers pass this off as Boring Yuppie Music (sorry <a href="http://www.reviler.org/2010/12/03/reviler-most-overrated-of-2010/">Josh at Reviler</a>). I’ll admit, <em>Local Natives</em> is an awful band name…the album, though, not so much. I’m a sucker for untraditional percussion, and _Gorilla Manor_features some progressive and driving rhythms throughout. Or maybe I’m just a sucker for Boring Yuppie Music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Album I should have bought and not listened to Steve:  LCD Soundsystem – This is Happening</strong> –  Steve and I had a Twitter conversation where he didn’t recommend buying LCD Soundsystem (I was going to buy it on vinyl).  I took his advice and then a few months later Amazon had it on sale for $3.99.  Bought it, listened to it, loved it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/5285793291/" title="sdc10577.jpg by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p><strong>Best Album released in December that didn’t make anyone’s Best of 2010 lists:  Ryan Adams &amp; The Cardinals – III / IV</strong> – One of the problems with everyone’s Christmas creep in releasing their lists early is they will inevitably leave off an album that’s released after their list.  This year, that album was III / IV.  I’m a huge Ryan Adams fan and somehow missed the announcement that the album was available and pre-order and it sold out within days on his website.  Luckily, Amazon had the vinyl album available.  <em>III / IV</em> are the outtakes from my favorite Ryan Adams’ album, <em>Easy Tiger</em>.   At 21 songs, it’s easy to find some songs that are clearly inferior to the <em>Easy Tiger</em> album, but there are a handful of songs that are as good as, if not better, than some of the tracks on <em>Easy Tiger</em>.  One of my favorite releases on vinyl this year, the album came with great art inside, and the vinyl albums themselves are beautiful – one red, one blue.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/sets/72157625538364737/">Pictures are available here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Best album released in the same year the band broke up:  Wolf Parade – Expo 86</strong> – I was sad to hear a few weeks ago that Wolf Parade was breaking up (though pleasantly surprised to learn that one of the members fronts Handsome Furs).  <em>Yulia</em> was a catchy song, if a bit overplayed locally.</p>
<p><strong>Best single:  Mumford and Sons – Little Lion Man</strong> – Released in October 2009 in the UK, but February 2010 in the US, Mumford and Sons just barely makes the best of 2010 list.  The first time I heard this song I had two thoughts:  I can’t believe this is playing on the radio (let’s just say they have to bleep out the chorus constantly) and second, wow, this will be in my head for days.  The rest of the album came to grow on me.  And more bands need banjos.</p>
<p><strong>Best packaging – of Montreal’s False Priest</strong> (<a href="http://www.polyvinylrecords.com/store/index.php?id=1287">red vinyl deluxe package</a>): A beautiful double LP on 180 gram red vinyl, it also included stickers, buttons and a great 20 page book of paintings by David Barnes.  It also included posters and a great t-shirt.  of Montreal is on the Polyvinyl record label, who truly gets not just how to be a successful independent record label, but how to connect with fans and offer high quality vinyl releases.</p>
<p><strong>Best Side Project:  Broken Bells – Broken Bells</strong> – The Shin’s lead singer James Mercer along with Danger Mouse (one half of Gnarls Barkley and famous producer) came together to release one of the year’s best albums.  The whole album from start to finish is absolutely amazing and I’m just kicking myself for not going to their December show at First Avenue.  (The Current is <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/12/30/broken_bells/">streaming that show at their website</a>).  Both artists have promised this is just the beginning for Broken Bells and I can’t wait to see what their next album holds.</p>
<p><strong>Best Mashup Album: Girl Talk – All Day</strong> – Thanks to the popularity of Glee, America was introduced to the term mashup in 2010.   But mashups have been around for years, and Girl Talk is currently the poster boy for the mashup album.  Where dance club mashups tend to be 2 or 3 songs put together, Gregg Gillis uses dozens of songs and samples to create a new song.  All Day features 372 samples and I’m amazed he’s getting local airplay here in Minneapolis, which I think is great.  (Which makes me wonder – if only the songwriter gets paid for radio airplay, who gets paid?)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/5306318559/" title="sdc10614.jpg by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p><strong>Best re-issue:  Nine Inch Nails – Pretty Hate Machine</strong> –  Trent Reznor’s debut album, out of print for most of the 1990s, finally changed ownership a couple of times, and Bicycle Records, the new owner allowed Reznor to do the remastering he had longed to do.  It was worth the wait.  The muddled and muted vocals are fixed and balanced with the music, which is brighter and cleaner.  I bought this on both CD and vinyl, and it worth buying both.  When I first bought my turntable this past spring, one of the first albums I searched for was this – which goes for $100 and up due its rarity.  The CD was worth it just for the new packaging.  Rob Sheridan, Trent Reznor’s long time designer, did a <a href="http://sleevage.com/nin-pretty-hate-machine/">great interview where he talks about the difficulty in re-creating the original artwork</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/5306318113/" title="sdc10613.jpg by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p><strong>Best album I wish I had purchased earlier:  Deerhunter – Halcyon Digest</strong> –  I finally picked this up earlier this week at a local record shop, Down in the Valley.  About a month ago, The Current featured it as their album of the week.  Mark Wheat, in his review, called it “ambient punk” and the label fits.  He also said that when friends and family ask you what indie music is, you should hold up this album as the example.  He’s right – this album is truly indie and the sound is like no other, from start to finish.  I can’t stop playing it these past few days.</p>
<p>I don’t have any witty descriptions for the following albums, other than these were some of my favorite albums that came out in 2010:</p>
<p><strong>Yeasayer – Odd Blood</strong> – One of my top three albums this year.  A unique sound and the album I played the most in February and March and then throughout the year.  Loved the video with Kristin Bell.</p>
<p><strong>Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin: Let it Sway</strong> – Another Polyvinyl release, SSLYBY brings an infectious, bright pop sound to indie music.  Sink/Let it Sway was a staple on The Current over the summer, and I was glad to hear them get the airplay.</p>
<p><strong>The New Pornographers – Together</strong> – I was disappointed to see how many critics left this off their best of lists this year.  I think the issue is that they put out such high quality albums time and again, that when another great album comes out, it’s exactly what the critics expect and they don’t get the credit they deserve.  I loved this album and it was one of the first vinyl albums I bought after buying my turntable.  AC Newman’s use of the entire ensemble and harmonizing between the male and female leads gets me every time.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Cult – Lightchasers</strong> – Members of the mailing list were able to buy this album three or four months before it was released and was it worth it!  The ethereal sound of Cloud Cult and their live shows are something no one is able to re-create.  This album celebrates the birth of their child (after losing a child a number of years ago) and their optimism shines brightly throughout this album.</p>
<p><strong>Minus the Bear – Omni</strong> – I’m told that Minus the Bear fans don’t think too highly of this album, but I loved it due to the fact it introduced me to them.  Buying some of their older albums is high on my wish list to compare.</p>
<p><strong>Jonsi – Go</strong> – The guitarist and lead vocalist for Sigur Ros goes solo (though he promises they haven’t broke up).  Let’s just say if you like Sigur Ros you’ll like this album.</p>
<p><strong>Spoon – Transference</strong> – Spoon strips down and goes back to their beginnings with a rougher sounding album and less catchy melodies and it works.</p>
<p><strong>Band of Horses – Infinite Arms</strong> – I don’t know what I can say that other critics haven’t already said about this album.  Go listen to it now.  I guarantee that <em>On My Way Home</em> will stick in your head for days.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny and Johnny – I’m Having Fun Now</strong> – Jenny Lewis of Rilo Kiley and her boyfriend Johnathan Rice release their first album together and it lives up to the title of the album.  I love Jenny Lewis’ voice and Johnny plays off her well.  This was also a great package, that when pre-ordered from their website, you got the vinyl, CD, a cassette tape and multiple 7″ records of the album.</p>
<p><strong>The National – High Violet</strong> – I didn’t think The National would ever be able to improve on Boxer, and then they release High Violet.  It’s one of those albums where you love the music and the more you listen you hear and understand the lyrics and you understand the true genius of a band.</p>
<p>Last, but definitely not least, probably my album of the year:</p>
<p><strong>Ben Folds &amp; Nick Hornby – Lonely Avenue</strong> – Having grown up playing the piano, I’m a sucker for musicians who play the piano, and Ben Folds has been one of my favorite artists for years.  Not just because of his piano skills (which are incredible) but his witty lyrics (and penchant for swearing).  When I heard a year ago that he was collaborating with author Nick Hornby, I couldn’t wait.  (You probably know Nick Hornby from the his novels adapted for movies including High Fidelity, About a Boy, and Fever Pitch.  All of his novels are fantastic).  At the same time, Ben Folds started asking questions on a vinyl record forum to gauge interest in releasing the album on vinyl, which they did do.  The vinyl albums was mastered and pressed at some of the most famous studios left for vinyl and the quality shows.</p>
<p>The album itself is fantastic – Hornby’s tongue in cheek lyrics to start the album in A Perfect Day ripping on bloggers to his timely lyrics about Levi Johnston and Sarah Palin In Levi Johnston’s Blues (my favorite song on the album) showcase Nick Hornby’s skill with a pen.  Ben Folds puts his trademark sounds, including piano solos and his unique vocals, to good use, making it one of the most unlikely, but great, collaborations to be released in a long, long time.</p>
<p>2010 was a great year in music and I can’t wait to see what 2011 brings!</p>

            <description>Thanks to Glee, mainstream America was introduced to the term mashup in 2010. But to some of us, we’ve been listening to mashups for years. Bootie, started in 2003 by DJs Adrian and Mysterious D, hosts monthly dance parties featuring mashups. Starting in 2005, they started publishing the year’s best mashups on their website. I’m not into pop music and Bootie is what introduces me to what’s been popular in the past year.</description>

<p>The <a href="http://bootiemashup.com/blog/2010/12/best-of-bootie-2010-mixtape-cd-finally-released.html">2010 Best of Bootie was just released</a>, and you can <a href="http://www.bootiemashup.com/bestofbootie2010/Best%20of%20Bootie%202010.zip">download the MP3s</a>, which play as one continuous mix, or, for the first time, <a href="http://www.bootiemashup.com/bestofbootie2010/">the unmixed files</a>, allowing you to mix and match songs without having the beginnings and ends cut off.   (If you you choose the MP3s and do want to burn it, remember to choose gapless burn in your software!)</p>
<p>And now, not so much a mini review of the Best of Bootie 2010, but some observations and thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track 2 – The Face Melters – Ice Ice Tik Tok (Ke$ha vs. Vanilla Ice) – Who knew Vanilla Ice would still be relevant 20 years later?  Great mix to kick it off with a bang.</li>
<li>Track 3 – DJ Tripp – Dynamite Pressure (Taio Cruz  vs. Queen &amp; David Bowie) – Always good to hear Queen, a popular band for mashups. I like how Vanilla Ice’s hook for Under Pressure transitions from the previous track into this song. (The Kleptone’s A Night at the Hip-Hopera was one of the first mashup albums I ever got into. Still one of my favorites, featuring all Queen songs overlaid by other’s vocals)</li>
<li>Track 5 – DJ Lobsterdust – Knock Out Eileen (LL Cool J vs. Dexy’s Midnight Runners) – When I first saw this track title, I thought no way could that work. It’s a knockout (pun intended).</li>
<li>Track 6 – Rad Bad – Moving Da Royalty (Will Smith vs. Daft Punk) – Same as 5. Can’t think of the last time I heard Will Smith rapping about Bel Air – it’s been years!. Great mashup with the bass line from Daft Punk.</li>
<li>Track 7 – Mashup-Germany vs. Faroff – Everybody &amp; Ray Speaks No Americano (Yolanda Be Cool &amp; DCUP vs. Backstreet Boys vs. Ray Charles vs. Benny Benassi) – Amusing. Wins longest title of the year. They should have given a credit to C&amp;C Music Factory too.</li>
<li>Track 11 -DJs From Mars – Enter Telephone (Lady Gaga vs. Metallica) – As the song opens, you get a combination of the famous guitar lick form Enter Sandman with Lady Gaga’s unique vocals. As the song progresses, the Metallica is not overwhelming, but when you overlay the keyboards it’s really well done, especially the chorus, at the guitar from Enter Sandman ratchets up.</li>
<li>Track 12 – DJs From Mars – Teenage Gay (Katy Perry vs. O.M.D.) – To an uneducated ear, you would think this is just a Katy Perry remix. Hearing the Enola Gay synth from OMD is a treat. It’s obvious at the start of the song, but much more subtle as the song progresses.</li>
<li>Track 14 – DJs From Mars – California Jump (Katy Perry vs. Van Halen) – Katy Perry’s vocals overlaid with the keyboard parts from Van Halen’s Jump. The first of 3(!) songs featuring Van Halen’s Jump in this years Best of Bootie.</li>
<li>Track 15 – The Kleptones – Jump You Fucker (Cee Lo Green vs. Van Halen) – Cee Lo’s smash hit Fuck You with Van Halen’s Jump. I’m surprised more Cee-Lo mashups didn’t make Best of Bootie this year – but it’s clear why this one did.</li>
<li>Track 16 – DJ Le Clown vs. Ludachrist – Pon De Billie Foley (Major Lazer vs. Michael Jackson vs. Harold Faltermeyer) – Axel Foley approves.</li>
<li>Track 19 – DJ Topcat – Folsom Prison Gangstaz (Eazy-E vs. Johnny Cash) – Easy-E and Johnny Cash. What else do they have in common besides this great mashup? They usually wore black. Another mashup on paper that you wouldn’t think goes together, but works really well. Speaking of Easy-E, takes me back to the first time I heard the Best of Bootie 2005 with Smells Like Compton – N.W.A vs Nirvana. Who thought that would work and it was one of the best mashups of 2005, if not all time.</li>
<li>Track 22 – LeeDM101 – (Find Myself) A Heap Of Love (Florence &amp; the Machine vs. Depeche Mode vs. Imogen Heap) – Slowing it down as the album starts to come to a close, Florence + the Machine was one of my favorite albums this year. Add some Depeche Mode some Imogen Heap, mix well, and kick back in listen.</li>
<li>Track 23 – Mighty Mike – Imagine A Jump (Van Halen vs. John Lennon) – The album winds down with John Lennon’s Imagine mixed with Van Halen’s Jump. David Lee Roth’s vocals actually work pretty well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again Bootie! (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/bootiemashup">Follow them on Twitter too</a>!)</p>

            <description>My wife (who knows me all too well) got me a gift I’ve been coveting since it was announed at CES last year: the Boxee Box.

I’ve been using Boxee on a Mac Mini hooked up to my home theater for almost two years now – and love it. Unfortunately, the Boxee Box by D-link has been a disappointment so far.
Setting up the box was a breeze – plug in the power and the HDMI and on first boot it checks for new firmware, which it downloaded, installed and rebooted.</description>

<p>I’ve been using Boxee on a Mac Mini hooked up to my home theater for almost two years now – and love it.  Unfortunately, the Boxee Box by D-link has been a disappointment so far.</p>
<p>Setting up the box was a breeze – plug in the power and the HDMI and on first boot it checks for new firmware, which it downloaded, installed and rebooted.  I’ve been a release or two behind on th Boxee software on my Mac Mini due to a bug it has with processing a full HD stream from my MythTV box, but using the new UI was simple.  It was easy to find where to adjust the screen size and add network shares to start scanning my local content.</p>
<p>And that’s where the problems started.</p>
<p>While scanning my content, I tried to watch The Daily Show from the Comedy Central website.  Video played fine but there was no audio.   Tried a Youtube video and the same thing.  I then tried to play a file locally from my NAS and guess what – no sound.</p>
<p>It appears I’m not <a href="http://forums.boxee.tv/showthread.php?t=22726&amp;highlight=no+sound">the</a> <a href="http://forums.boxee.tv/showthread.php?t=22726&amp;highlight=no+sound">only</a> <a href="http://forums.boxee.tv/showthread.php?t=22521&amp;highlight=no+sound">one</a>.  Sure enough, plugging the Boxee Box directly into my TV and not my receiver, sound and video work fine.  Connecting the HDMI into the receiver, I get video and no audio.</p>
<p>This has to be a problem in software – I’m familiar with the HDMI spec, and transmitting a video signal and not audio is not a physical problem.  I own a Denon AVR-4306 – it’s not like it’s a cheap receiver either.</p>
<p>The second major issue is that the MythTV support I’ve been using in Boxee doesn’t seem to work on the Boxee Box.   Rumor is that the mythtv:// protocol was removed, but I haven’t been able to confirm it yet.  What’s worse, trying to play back video via the MythTV UPnP doesn’t work for me either, which seems to be <a href="http://forums.boxee.tv/showthread.php?t=22029&amp;highlight=mythtv">hit or miss for most people</a>.</p>
<p>I want to love the Boxee Box.  I really do.  The fact that sound is not working for a small subset of people is concerning.  I love the software, but the hardware implementation just isn’t there yet.</p>
<p>Some other random observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>I love the form factor.  I know some people don’t, but I love how unique it is.  I like how the Boxee logo lights up when it’s powered on.</li>
<li>The remote is awesome.  Perfectly sized and light.  The keyboard built into the remote is good too – not too big or too small.</li>
<li>I was happy to open the packaging, take out the Boxee Box and have a paper copy of the GPL.  That always makes me smile.</li>
<li>An HDMI cable is included.  A very nice touch.</li>
<li>I like the browser improvements they’ve made in the new WebKit browser.  It’s much easier to move the mouse cursor using the remote.</li>
<li>I’m happy with the new firmware updates – the changes they made to playing back local media and listening to their users feedback was impressive.</li>
<li>I won’t even comment on the lack of Hulu and Netflix support – they promise it’s coming, but it’s not out yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to love the Boxee Box.  Especially since my wife bought it for me.  But it doesn’t work for me and I don’t know if I’m going to keep it yet.  I may buy a new TV for a different room in the house sometime in the next year, but it seems silly to hang on to something I can’t use.  Please try again Boxee.</p>

            <description>From the better late than never department, the 2009 GNOME Foundation Annual Report has been released.

When Lucas first asked me to help with the annual report a year and a half ago at GUADEC in Gran Canaria, one of the goals was to try and help it come out sooner. Apparently, I had the opposite effect. I have lots of excuses, but none of them good. (Though someone did point out to me that Mozilla just released their 2009 report a few weeks ago, so I felt a bit better.</description>

<p>When <a href="http://lucasr.org/">Lucas</a> first asked me to help with the annual report a year and a half ago at GUADEC in Gran Canaria, one of the goals was to try and help it come out sooner. Apparently, I had the opposite effect. I have lots of excuses, but none of them good. (Though someone did point out to me that Mozilla <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/annualreport/2009/">just released their 2009</a> report a few weeks ago, so I felt a bit better. But not a whole lot, I hate being tardy, believe it or not).</p>
<p>The Annual Report wouldn’t have happened without <a href="http://live.gnome.org/DanielGalleguillos/">Daniel Galleguillos C.</a> who did all of the design and layout work and put up with my constant change requests. (Thanks to those who have already found a couple small typos – please email me with any more you find and I’ll work to get an updated copy out this weekend).</p>
<p>Thanks to all of our writers, including Jason Clinton, Pockey Lam, Stormy Peters and Diego Escalante Urrelo – and everyone who contributed to a quarterly report. I’d also like to thank everyone who helped with photos or re-licensed their photos so we were able to use them including Cody Russell, Chris Lord, Michael Dominic K., and Lucas Rocha. Lastly, thanks to everyone who helped edit and everyone I’m forgetting (because I know I am – especially on the photos!)</p>
<p>Work is already beginning on the 2010 report. It will be out sooner (I promise) and I’m also going to change it so it coincides with GNOME’s fiscal year rather than calendar year, so it may be a slightly smaller as there will be some overlap. If you want to help out, let me know!</p>

            <description>Hall &amp;amp; Oates play a sold out show tonight in Minneapolis at the State Theater. I fondly remember growing up listening to my father’s lite rock station as their hits were played. With six #1 songs, it’s good to see Hall &amp;amp; Oates music celebrated for the pop genius that it is. No one is going to pretend that their songs will change the world, but they are catchy and stay with you long after you hear them – which is exactly what a good pop song should do.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/5216094392/" title="sdc10576.jpg by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hallandoates.com/">Hall &amp; Oates</a> play a <a href="http://www.vita.mn/event_detail.php?event_id=100836">sold out show tonight in Minneapolis at the State Theater</a>.   I fondly remember growing up listening to my father’s lite rock station as their hits were played.  With six #1 songs, it’s good to see Hall &amp; Oates music celebrated for the pop genius that it is.  No one is going to pretend that their songs will change the world, but they are catchy and stay with you long after you hear them – which is exactly what a good pop song should do.  Hall &amp; Oates have never pretended to be anything other than what they are.</p>
<p>One of my favorite album’s this year was <a href="http://www.thebirdandthebee.com/">The Bird and the Bee’s</a> Interpreting the Masters Volume 1: A Tribute to Daryl Hall and John Oates.  Covering 9 of their hits and clocking in at over just 30 minutes, they do a note for note rendition of Hall and Oates’ greatest hits. Inara George’s ethereal voice does a wonderful job adding nuance and depth to these timeless pop hits.</p>
<p>I originally bought the album earlier this year on a whim when it was featured for less than $5 as an Amazon deal of the day.  I own The Bird and the Bee’s earlier albums and you may know their hit Diamond Dave about David Lee Roth, which has received airplay on The Current and other indie rock stations.  For $5 and a return to my youth, I couldn’t go wrong.  It quickly became one of my favorite albums of the year – when I need something poppy or to get me going it made great background music.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago on Black Friday and Record Store Day, I came across a vinyl copy (pictured above) on sale at the Exclusive Company.  For $12, how could I say no?  And now I’ve bought two copies of a cover album and continue to enjoy it.</p>
<p>With the show tonight, Hall and Oates are receiving some good press in the Twin Cities.  The Star Tribune’s entertainment section, <a href="http://www.vita.mn/story.php?id=111554329&amp;elr=KArksUUUycaEacyU">Vita.MN, takes a look at what continues to make Hall and Oates relevant</a>.  The City Pages looks at <a href="http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2010/12/hall_oates_eigh.php">eight awesome moments we have Hall and Oates to thank for</a>.</p>

            <description>It’s that time of the year when various writers and magazines start publishing their “Best of” lists as the year draws to a close.
Whether it’s a top 10 list or a top 50 list doesn’t matter – what matters is we celebrate the the great music that came out in 2010. I’m pleasantly surprised in perusing the lists how many of these albums I’ve purchased and enjoyed. While I may disagree with some of the rankings, I generally agree with almost all of the lists I’ve seen so far.</description>

Somehow I went through the 90s oblivious to Superchunk. I’m sure they were played on Rev105 back in the day, but for some reason I just don’t remember them. I’m now making up for lost time.
Amazon MP3 has had a number of specials on Superchunk since their September release of their latest album, Majesty Strategy, their first release in 9 years.</description>

<p>Somehow I went through the 90s oblivious to <a href="http://superchunk.com/">Superchunk</a>.  I’m sure they were played on Rev105 back in the day, but for some reason I just don’t remember them.  I’m now making up for lost time.</p>
<p>Amazon MP3 has had a number of specials on Superchunk since their September release of their latest album, Majesty Strategy, their first release in 9 years.  This month you can get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00400ERFU/ref=nosim?tag=gnomestore-20&amp;linkCode=sb1&amp;camp=212353&amp;creative=380549">remastered version of On the Mouth</a> for only $5.</p>
<p>It’s been well documented that one of the major reasons for the delay between releases is that two of the founders of Superchunk, Mac McCaughan and Laura Ballance, are the founders of the record label, <a href="http://www.mergerecords.com/">Merge</a>, which they still run.  You may not have heard of Merge, but I can guarantee you’ve heard of two little bands on the label, Arcade Fire and Spoon.  As you can imagine, that keeps them busy.</p>
<p>Superchunk is <a href="http://www.vita.mn/event_detail.php?event_id=102019&amp;elr=KArksUUUycaEacyU">playing at First Avenue tonight</a> and the Twin Cities is all a-buzz with their return.  The Star Tribune currently features tonight’s Superchunk show on their front page and the City Pages has great coverage.  They <a href="http://www.citypages.com/2010-12-01/music/superchunk-return-after-nearly-a-decade/">published an interview</a> today and later in the day <a href="http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2010/12/superchunks_mac.php">published the complete transcript</a> including quotes that didn’t make the print edition.</p>
<p>They talk about Superchunk’s songs, running Merge and some of the great shows they’ve had playing at 7th Street Entry and First Avenue.  What I wouldn’t give to have seen Superchunk with Rilo Kiley at the Entry…</p>
<p>And if you <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/superchunkband/status/10054833084039168">see their guitar on an American flight, let them know</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update December 2nd</em>:  A cover of Velvet Underground’s John Cale’s Child’s Christmas was released today.  Read more about it and <a href="http://www.covermesongs.com/2010/12/superchunk-covers-john-cale-for-a-not-so-merry-christmas.html">stream it at Cover Me</a>. <em>(</em><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/largeheartedboy/status/10297119889952768"><em>Via Largeheartedboy</em></a><em>)</em></p>

            <description>As a huge (American) football fan, it amuses me to no end how my children get into the excitement of game day. They know how much I love my football teams and want to know who the Packers (or Badgers) are playing each week, which other teams I want to win in the other games, and share my enthusiasm for the game. Jack’s knowledge of the players and the opposing teams is almost scary considering he is only 4 years old.</description>

<p>As a Wisconsin native living in Minnesota, they really get excited when the Green Bay Packers take on the Minnesota Vikings. (Though all real Packer fans know the real rivalry is with the Bears – a fact that Minnesotans just don’t understand. The Packer / Viking rivalry is nothing compared to that one – ask me about the time I went to a Packer / Bears game at Lambeau sometime).</p>
<p>So I was happy to see, that without any prompting from me, my two youngest pick out their own clothes this morning:</p>

John (J5) Palmieri and Jon McCann helped kick off the Summit.
J5 gave an overview of what the Boston Summit is. It’s different from GUADEC which is many presentations and more formal talks. The Boston Summit is much more informal and run Barcamp style. It gives hackers a chance to hack together and get stuff done.</description>

<p>John (J5) Palmieri and Jon McCann helped kick off the Summit.</p>
<p>J5 gave an overview of what the Boston Summit is. It’s different from GUADEC which is many presentations and more formal talks. The Boston Summit is much more informal and run Barcamp style. It gives hackers a chance to hack together and get stuff done. Face to face time is very important and the Boston Summit helps facilitate that.</p>
<p>Jon McCann continued the kickoff and thanked Stormy for her time at the GNOME Foundation as Executive Director to a rousing round of applause.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/5151493118/" title="sdc10517.jpg by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>He then gave an update on things he’s been working on. The Control Center is actively being developed in GNOME git, new themes for GNOME Shell are coming online, and GNOME 3.0 will feature a new font! The new font is designed by David Crossland (spelling?) who is a big believer in open design and is also hosted on GNOME’s git servers.</p>
<p>Jon talked about Shell briefly (and Owen will talk about it more later today). New guidelines are being written for GNOME 3 applications and wiki pages discussing that as well as compatibility and messaging are in progress. He asked the crowd how many people were running GNOME Shell now and about 25% of the hands in the room went up.</p>
<p>Work on the new modulesets for GNOME is in progress and there is a renewed focus on GNOME’s core and a focus on what the desktop is. One conversation that he looked forward to having this weekend is what is the Core OS versus the applications that layer on top of it. A goal is to make it easier to build the core desktop. One example of this is jhbuild – jhbuild has seen its core modules reduced from 255 to 92 modules! Jon is hoping the group will continue to brainstorm on how to make that even easier.</p>
<p>There are 3-5 months left for development (depending on how you look at freezes) and now is a great time for the community to come together. GNOME 3.0 is a very important release for GNOME and it will take all of us.</p>
<p>Lastly, Jon encouraged the community to watch the video of the talk that Michael Meeks gave at Linux Plumbers this week. The talk was about how GNOME is doing open source right. GNOME has a strong message to share and other projects look to us for things such as doing design in the open, community engagement and more.</p>
<p>From there, people proposed talks and sessions to give Barcamp style and we voted to help prioritize the sessions and J5 started assigning rooms and times for the talks.</p>

            <description>Most people by now have heard that news that Stormy is leaving as the Executive Director of the GNOME Foundation to take a position at Mozilla.
I’ve had a few people reach out to me to follow up on her announcement to make sure it has nothing to do with the drama going on in the community (it doesn’t) or concerned about the timing with GNOME 3.0 coming (GNOME 3.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4848585071/" title="sdc10350.jpg by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Most people by now have heard that news that <a href="http://stormyscorner.com/2010/11/changing-roles.html">Stormy is leaving</a> as the Executive Director of the GNOME Foundation to take a position at Mozilla.</p>
<p>I’ve had a few people reach out to me to follow up on her announcement to make sure it has nothing to do with the drama going on in the community (it doesn’t) or concerned about the timing with GNOME 3.0 coming (GNOME 3.0 is still coming!)</p>
<p>Now, no one on the Board asked me to do this and I’m speaking for myself, but I believe we’ll be ok. We have a great release coming in April and the Release Team is doing a great job of overseeing that. GNOME Developers are porting apps fast and furious to GTK3, GNOME Shell is coming along nicely, release parties are being planned, docs are being written and I could keep going on. None of these activities are going to stop because we don’t have an ED.</p>
<p>Most of us have left a job at some point – it’s not personal. And Stormy gets to work on something she’s passionate about. I saw this first hand this past April at the Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit where she organized a track to talk about how the desktop should interact with web services. Cornelius from KDE spoke, I spoke, Rejon from identi.ca and more. She also received some great press from a talk she gave this past August about software freedom on the web. And now she has a chance to work to further that cause – which is a worthy one. While I’m sad to see her go, I’m happy to know she continues to work on software freedom and something she is just as passionate about, if not more so.</p>
<p>Stormy has always been visible to the GNOME community and transparent about the work she does with her regular updates of what she’s working on via her blog and emails to the Foundation list. But one of the most important things she did within the community was never in those recaps – and that’s the encouragement she provided to everyone who pinged her. As the face of the Foundation, volunteers would ping her to get her opinion on a new idea or a new feature. They valued her opinion, but more importantly, they wanted affirmation they were doing something right.</p>
<p>Stormy did that for me – in my last job I would commute to Boulder, Colorado about once a quarter, which isn’t too far from where Stormy lived. I was active in the community, but with Stormy’s gentle nudges, I was inspired to take that to the next level. Stormy made time for me and we would meet for coffee or lunch every couple of months and brainstorm and get stuff done. Stormy encouraged me to come to GUADEC in 2009 and was always there to listen to a new idea or answer a question.</p>
<p>I am grateful we had someone as qualified as Stormy to work for the Foundation the last 2+ years. Sure, I’m sad to see her go – not that she’s going far – but more importantly, I’m thankful for everything she has done for everyone in the GNOME community. Thanks again Stormy!</p>

            <description>…and it is the ESPN app on the new Xbox 360 update that was released today.
I’ve been in the beta for the new Xbox 360 dashboard for the last month or so, and with its release today, the embargo on blogging about it has been lifted.
Since I cut the cord and got rid of cable TV last February, the one thing that has been missing is sports. I’ve been tied to whatever the four major networks want to shovel at me.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>…and it is the ESPN app on the new <a href="http://majornelson.com/archive/2010/11/01/xbox-360-dashboard-update-is-now-available-november-2010.aspx?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+MajorNelson+(Major+Nelson+(Xbox))">Xbox 360 update that was released today</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been in the beta for the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/xbox-live-fall-2010-dashboard-update-preview-espn-netflix-sear/">new Xbox 360 dashboard</a> for the last month or so, and with its release today, the embargo on blogging about it has been lifted.</p>
<p>Since I <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?tag=boxee">cut the cord and got rid of cable TV last February</a>, the one thing that has been missing is sports. I’ve been tied to whatever the four major networks want to shovel at me. And I’m a sports junkie. I’m a huge (American) football fan, cheering for both the University of Wisconsin Badgers and Green Bay packers, and as soon as football season ends I dive right into college basketball. Having been a DirecTV customer for ten years I would pay hundreds of dollars for the NFL Sunday ticket and the March Madness packages. I’ve also started getting back into MLB the last few years cheering for the Minnesota Twins. And this summer I could only watch them on Sunday afternoons – the only time they were available over the air.</p>
<p>The ESPN app on the Xbox 360 changes all of that. It’s amazing – especially for college football. Branding the app as “ESPN3”, it’s a repackaged version of ESPN360 with more content available live and on demand. If you have ESPN as a cable subscriber, you’ll get to watch the game they pick for you at 11am (CST) on Saturday. With ESPN3 on the 360 you have access to every game ESPN has rights to – 4 or 5 games at 11, and about the same at 2:30. Using my IP, they did blackout the 2:30 p.m. game if it was on ABC but I still had access to all the other games. And the best part was, you could choose to watch it live or you could start at the beginning if you were tuning in late. On the 360, ESPN3 offers full DVR functionality – you could pause, rewind and fast forward. A number of games are also archived for a few days and you can watch them on demand after the game was over. It was fantastic watching the Badgers beat the Buckeyes a week ago on ESPN3 – without having to pay for cable TV.</p>
<p>Other content available includes NBA games, a number of second tier college sports, and selected ESPN content. There is no NFL content, including Monday Night Football games – not a huge surprise, considering the draconian rules the NFL has to protect their brand. The available ESPN original content is the only thing I’m disappointed with. You only get some highlights and clips from SportsCenter – I didn’t expect the whole show, but I did expect more. But where it really lets me down is ESPN shows like Rome is Burning, Around the Horn, E:60 and PTI (especially PTI!) aren’t available. They might have one or two clips from each, though with the official launch today I can’t find PTI at all. I don’t know if it’s a rights issue that they don’t show these original shows as they features clips and highlights from the sports broadcasts themselves or why they’re not available, but I had hoped for more original content. And the updates too those clips, at least during the beta, weren’t very timely.</p>
<p>The only catch with ESPN3 on Xbox360 is you have to have a broadband provider who has partnered with Microsoft. I don’t know for sure, but I’m guessing it has to be someone who offers TV service of some kind. My dashboard shows co-branding with Comcast as I have Comcast cable internet service.</p>
<p>As a college football fan, and general sports fan, this fixes the one major downside I had in cutting the cable. It’s an awesome experience. Live and on-demand content available at my fingertips. This is what the future will bring once the content providers figure out their new business models. If they do.</p>
<p>Oh, and the Netflix app in today’s update finally added the ability to search so you don’t have to use your PC to add titles to your Instant Queue. Finally!</p>

</ul>
<p>In other news, <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/snowy-list/2010-October/msg00019.html">Snowy 0.5, “Cavalier King Charles Spaniel”, was released on Monday</a> to coincide with the GNOME 2.91.1 release and Tomboy Online was updated to Snowy 0.5. There is a method to the madness in Sandy’s choice of release names – I have a GNOME sticker (or stickers) as a prize to the first person who can tell me. (<em>Contest not open to Snowy developers. Must be a resident of Planet Earth. Other rules and restrictions may apply but probably not. I’ll pay postage.</em>) Version 0.5 was a minor bugfix release – expect lots of big changes after the hackfest. (Note I just say after – can’t hold me to a date!)</p>
<p>We received some new UI mockups – <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Snowy/DesignerPlayground">check them out</a> on the wiki! Here’s one:</p>

            <description>Fast Company has coverage of The City music conference, where Rob Dickens, the former head of Warner Music in the UK argues that the success of the MP3 single necessitates radically slashing album prices.
Dickens’ theory is albums should cost about $1.50 to increase impulse purchases and combat piracy. Interestingly, he predicts that major albums could go on to sell 200 million albums – or double what Michael Jackson’s Thriller sold.</description>

<p>Read the story and look at the graph between album sales and individual track sales.    You can pretty much see the rise of iTunes.</p>
<p>As someone who is an unabashed fan of albums, I love the idea.  I don’t buy music singles and I don’t even really make playlists – I buy and listen to an artist’s whole album at the time.  And I also agree with the price – the bulk of my impulse music purchases are Amazon deals – either daily deals for $3 – $4 or one of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=dm_bb_100_5_b?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000371251&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=left-1&amp;pf_rd_r=1GT5A6D8M3S5KFS9ES6P&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1277679142&amp;pf_rd_i=163856011">hundred $5 albums</a> they rotate monthly.</p>

            <description>I can’t think of many worse ways to start a week than to read Bryen’s blog post this morning about having his equipment stolen as he travels to the Accessibility conference and hackfest. I was impressed to see how many of my friends shared the post in Google Reader to pass the news on.
I pinged Stormy to see if there was something we can do and and she let me know my co-worker Stephen Shaw was already on it.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can’t think of many worse ways to start a week than to read <a href="http://www.bryen.com/still-devastated/">Bryen’s blog post</a> this morning about having his equipment stolen as he travels to the Accessibility conference and hackfest. I was impressed to see how many of my friends shared the post in Google Reader to pass the news on.</p>
<p>I pinged Stormy to see if there was something we can do and and she let me know my co-worker <a href="http://www.decriptor.com/2010/10/04/someone-in-need/">Stephen Shaw was already on it</a>. Stephen has set up a <a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/13645">Pledgie to collect donations</a> to help Bryen out. I’m pretty excited as I went out to lunch and after coming back I see we’re already halfway past the goal!</p>
<p>I first met Bryen almost a year ago at the first GNOME Marketing Hackfest in Chicago. It was great meeting him in person and understanding how he used GNOME gave me a better understanding for how important GNOME’s support for accessibility is. Since then, I’ve worked and talked with Bryen about GNOME marketing and openSUSE marketing and have really enjoyed working with him.</p>
<p>If you have a few dollars you can spare, <a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/13645">please think about donating</a>. Thanks!</p>

            <description>The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees have been announced for 2011. While there are a few good nominees, including the Beastie Boys, Neil Diamond and Tom Waits, there are the not so good. That list would include Bon Jovi, the J. Geils Band and Donna Summer. While each of them have contributed to the history of rock &amp;amp; roll, let’s put them in perspective of some of the groups and artists snubbed by the Hall of Fame:</description>

            <description>The GNOME 2.32 release notes need your help!
If you have a GNOME 2.31.x development environment, I’m looking for 2 or 3 screenshots:
 GNOME desktop with either Nautilus (and some files and folders cut and ready to be pasted) OR 2.32 desktop with Empathy showing meta-contacts Empathy with meta-contacts Nautilus with some files or folders cut and ready to be pasted  When using the GNOME screenshot tool, you can select the entire desktop or the application with focus.</description>

<p>If you have a GNOME 2.31.x development environment, I’m looking for 2 or 3 screenshots:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNOME desktop with either Nautilus (and some files and folders cut and ready to be pasted) OR 2.32 desktop with Empathy showing meta-contacts</li>
<li>Empathy with meta-contacts</li>
<li>Nautilus with some files or folders cut and ready to be pasted</li>
</ul>
<p>When using the GNOME screenshot tool, you can select the entire desktop or the application with focus. No effects should be applie and you may need to turn Compiz off with some distros (otherwise the window borders aren’t visible).</p>
<p>A couple guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screenshots must use the Clearlooks theme, a GNOME background / wallper and the default GNOME icons</li>
<li>The icon in the GNOME menu on the panel must show the GNOME foot, not a distribution logo</li>
<li>Your GNOME panel should be as clean as possible (If using Ubuntu, do not show the messaging menu in the panel)</li>
<li>If using openSUSE, your panel needs to be on the top</li>
<li>Your screenshots will be licensed under a CC-BY 3.0 license</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry for all the rules! You will receive attribution in the release notes. Email them to me at pcutler at gnome dot org. Thanks!</p>

            <description>We launched the sign-ups for the upcoming Tomboy Online alpha last week. As part of the sign-up process we included a brief survey asking what features those signing up were interested in and to rate them on a scale of 1 – 5, which 5 being very interested.
We asked them to rate the following features:
 Free note synchronization for Tomboy Sharing my notes so other users can read them Editing my notes from my desktop web browser Native Android app (Tomdroid) Native iOS app HTML5 offline client (for all mobile desktop browsers) Editing my notes from my mobile device (browser, native app, whatever)  Here are the results:</description>

<p>It’s a fairly small sample, but I’m still please to see so little interest in iOS and a huge interest in Android and HTML5.</p>
<p><a href="http://live.gnome.org/Hackfests/Snowy">Snowy was approved for a hackfest</a> at the Boston Summit. The hackfest goals include match up nicely with the survey results. The goals include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile client for accessing and syncing notes</li>
<li>Implement UI / Design via CSS</li>
<li>Implement a text editor</li>
<li>Implement note sharing between users via the web interface</li>
<li>Prepare Tomboy Online for Beta release</li>
</ul>
<p>And if there are any companies that want to help sponsor the hackfest, please let me or Stormy know!</p>
<p>We’re excited to be working on a web service that integrates with the GNOME Desktop. We have one bug to fix that’s delayed the alpha launch slightly. Thanks to everyone who has signed up and we’ll get the invites out ASAP.</p>

            <description>The Needle Doctor, Minnesota’s premier retailer (and online retailer) of everything related to turntable hardware, is moving.
After I first bought my turntable in April, I had gone on a buying spree of used records. Most of them needed cleaning and I also needed something to get the dust that would build up on my cartridge. Doing some quick Google searches, I kept coming up with links to the Needle Doctor.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.needledoctor.com/">Needle Doctor</a>, Minnesota’s premier retailer (and online retailer) of everything related to turntable hardware, <a href="http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2010/09/needle_doctor_r.php">is moving</a>.</p>
<p>After I first bought my turntable in April, I had gone on a buying spree of used records.  Most of them needed cleaning and I also needed something to get the dust that would build up on my cartridge.  Doing some quick Google searches, I kept coming up with links to the Needle Doctor.  I was pretty excited to realize they were in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>One afternoon I printed out directions (yes, I live way out in the ‘burbs) and took Zoe, my six year old daughter, along for the ride.  We get there and I realize I didn’t need directions – they’re located in Dinkytown in the heart of the University of Minnesota campus.</p>
<p>Whether you need something cheap and basic like cleaning supplies to a new turntable to $1200 cartridges, the Needle Doctor has it.  When we visited, there were 3 or 4 people working up front and another 2 or 3 in the back of this tiny store front.   The customer service rep answered my questions (and confirmed I had picked out the right cleaning solution!) and took care of me.  After the sale was completed, I realized I had forgotten to pick up a 45 adapter for my turntable.  After I asked, he reached into a drawer and tossed me a used one free.  Now that’s service!</p>
<p>The Needle Doctor has everything online – I highly recommend them if you need to pick anything up for your turntable.  I’ll make sure to be visiting their new location – especially as it cuts down on the drive by 50%!</p>
<p>Make sure to <a href="http://www.mndaily.com/2010/09/21/needle-doctor-leaving-dinkytown">read this article</a> as it has more detail than the City Pages article linked above and gives you a feel for what Dinkytown used to be.</p>

            <title>Six Months Without Satellite TV</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2010/09/six-months-without-satellite-tv/</link>

            <description>It’s been six months since I cut the cable and canceled DirecTV, going over-the-air and internet only.
Do I miss DirecTV?
In a word, no.
This past Sunday started the real test as I’m a huge (American) football fan. Living in Minnesota and being a Green Bay Packers fan, this season is the first in ten years that I haven’t had DirecTV’s NFL Sunday ticket to watch out of market games (luckily the Packers were the national game this past Sunday).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4983919367/" title="img_6217.jpg by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>It’s been six months since I cut the cable and canceled DirecTV, going over-the-air and internet only.</p>
<p>Do I miss DirecTV?</p>
<p>In a word, no.</p>
<p>This past Sunday started the real test as I’m a huge (American) football fan. Living in Minnesota and being a Green Bay Packers fan, this season is the first in ten years that I haven’t had DirecTV’s NFL Sunday ticket to watch out of market games (luckily the Packers were the national game this past Sunday). I also missed my beloved University of Wisconsin Badgers play the last two weeks, but I think I’m going to make it (especially as they play tomorrow on ABC).</p>
<p>None of this would have been possible except for three innovations: <a href="http://www.boxee.tv">Boxee</a>, <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> and streaming <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>.</p>
<p>The only hiccup I had was my antenna setup – the first couple of months everything was great, except NBC was a bit flaky, which was to be expected. The local NBC affiliate is the only TV station not on the HDTV antenna array here in the Twin Cities, and the antenna they use is notorious for its weak signal. But after a couple of months, I started experiencing signal strength issues with almost all of the channels. After doing a bit of research, I climbed up on the roof, and turned the antenna 90 degrees, as seen in the photo above so it faces the direction of the antenna tower. I was worried that even if I did so, I’d still have signal strength issues as the antenna is now parallel with the roof but under the roof line – but thankfully all of my signal strength issues appear fixed going in to the fall TV season. And now my satellite dish just sits on the roof, unused.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?tag=boxee">I’ve previously talked</a> about my setup and with summer TV being mostly re-runs, I’ve been using Netflix. A lot. I’m glad to see Netflix continue to focus on expanding their catalog for streaming titles and was interested to read how much cheaper streaming is for them vs. mailing DVDs. With the new fall TV season starting, MythTV has proved invaluable in recording off-air TV shows and automatically removing the commercials helping make watching TV more enjoyable. I’m probably only using 20% of what MythTV is capable of. And for the cable shows I don’t have, Boxee’s Hulu integration continue to works pretty well. It’s standard def quality – but you get what you pay for, so you won’t find me complaining. Additionally, I’ve converted all of the movies I own and store them on my NAS, adding another library of content to watch through Boxee as well as stream to my old <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-media-receivers/netgear-eva8000-digital-entertainer/4505-6739_7-32331171.html">Netgear Eva</a> in my bedroom.</p>
<p>I’m also keeping an eye on the <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/box">Boxee Box</a>, launching later this year. I’ve been using Boxee with my 60″ Sony HDTV in my man cave and if and when we replace the old analog TV in the living room, I’ll have some interesting choices to make. Between <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/1005/7099?WT.mc_id=google_googletv_redirect_052010">Google TV</a>, Boxee and even <a href="http://litl.com/">litl</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/13/litl-working-on-a-settop-box-with-smartphone-like-remote-not-sc/">working on a set top box</a>, there will be some interesting choices to bring internet content to the TV. And with <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/39213429/">CNBC reporting this morning that 37% of adults 25-34 who subscribe to Neflix now use Netflix instead of cable and satellite service</a>, DirecTV, Comcast and other satellite / cable providers are going to need to find a new business model. Fast.</p>

            <description>Rolling Stone released their list of the 25 best record stores in the United States yesterday.
Minneapolis was well represented with Electric Fetus coming in as the sixth best record store in the U.S. and Hymie’s Vintage Records rounded out the list at twenty-five.
In July I went on a bit of a shopping spree at Electric Fetus, which is also where I spent Record Store Day 2009. There is no question that Electric Fetus has one of, if not the best, selection in the Twin Cities, though Cheapo gives them a pretty strong run for selection.</description>

<p>I’m embarrassed to admit I hadn’t heard of Hymies until now – I definitely know where my next round of shopping is going to be!</p>

Things have been relatively quiet since my last update about Snowy a couple of weeks ago. What’s been going on behind the scenes:
 Sandy triaged and assigned milestones to lots of features requests in Snowy bugzilla. Jeff hacked on Snowy to allow users to add a second OpenID provider to an existing account. Unfortunately it will have to be refactored as it works great for new users signing up but not for existing users as the form enforces that the users are unique.</description>

I’m working on the privacy policy for Tomboy Online and I’m looking for examples of good privacy polices.
Users will have the ability keep their notes private or share them with other users and as the GNOME Snowy server will be hosting all of the data we will want to have a privacy policy in place.
If you know of a website or web service with a good privacy please comment or drop me an email.</description>

<p><em>Steve Miller</em></p>
<p>I’ve been using Banshee for years now and I don’t know how I’d manage my (too) large music collection without it. The Banshee team released 1.7.5 on Tuesday. <a href="http://banshee.fm/download/archives/1.7.5/">Banshee 1.7.5</a> has two new big features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beta support for iPod Touch and iPhone, probably one of the most requested features that I’ve seen users ask for in IRC.</li>
<li>Amazon support, probably my favorite new features in the last couple of years. Aaron has <a href="http://abock.org/2010/07/23/announcing-banshee-1-7-3">previously blogged about the Amazon integration</a> and if you hadn’t heard, the <a href="http://abock.org/2010/08/02/banshee-gnome-amazon-mp3">Banshee maintainers have made the GNOME Foundation the beneficiary of the referral codes</a>. <a href="http://jaap.haitsma.org/2010/09/02/gnome-amazon-referral-fees-august-2010/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+BlogOfJaapAHaitsma+(Blog+of+Jaap+A.+Haitsma)">Jaap blogged earlier today</a> about the monetary benefit the Foundation is already seeing, and this is with the development version! Imagine when users will have easy access to the latest Banshee in openSUSE 11.4, Fedora 14 and Ubuntu 10.10!</li>
</ul>
<p>Trying to do my part, I’ve been working on all new documentation for Banshee written as topic based help using <a href="http://www.projectmallard.org">Mallard</a>. The first release of user help <a href="http://banshee.fm/download/archives/1.7.4/">was last month in Banshee 1.7.4</a> and with 1.7.5 I’d call it functionally complete.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4953015936/" title="banshee-help by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p><em>(Click through to see a bigger version)</em></p>
<p>Now is when the fun starts! My process is to write and write some more, and then come back and edit. I think I have most of the major help topics covered. Or do I? I need your help! Take a look through the docs. Have I missed any topics? Can you find mistakes I’ve made in how Banshee works? (I don’t pretend to be a Banshee expert or even use half of it’s features!) Typos? Grammar errors? (I wish I was a machine and could type perfectly, but sometimes I type like <a href="http://paulcutler.org/files/abocklolcat.jpg">Aaron on a Thinkpad T410</a>).</p>
<p>Lastly, I need to add content for common problems and advanced help, such as adding an is_audio file to some MP3 players to have Banshee recognize the player.</p>
<p>How can you help after doing one of the tasks above? <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=banshee">File a bug</a>! Drop me an email! Ping me in IRC in #banshee on GIMPNet! I want your feedback and ways I can make the help better, especially with the advanced topics and common problems that users may see.</p>
<p>And a big thank you to Aaron, Gabriel, Bertrand, Alex and all the developers who keep Banshee rockin’.</p>

            <description>“I steal from every movie ever made.” – Quentin Tarantino
Like Quentin, I’m stealing from Frederic Peters’ recent “Shell Yes!” blog post and am going to try and bring you, our loyal reader, semi-regular updates on what’s going on in the world of Snowy development as we work towards launching Tomboy Online.
Jeff Schroeder patched Snowy this week using, as he puts it, “Shiney django admin stuff” to not allow users who are not in the upcoming alpha and beta to sync their notes.</description>

<p>Like Quentin, I’m stealing from <a href="http://www.0d.be/2010/08/25/shell-yes-1/">Frederic Peters’ recent “Shell Yes!” blog post</a> and am going to try and bring you, our loyal reader, semi-regular updates on what’s going on in the world of Snowy development as we work towards launching Tomboy Online.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.digitalprognosis.com/">Jeff Schroeder</a> patched Snowy this week using, as he puts it, “Shiney django admin stuff” to not allow users who are not in the upcoming alpha and beta to sync their notes. Users will instead see something similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="http://bugzilla-attachments.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=168608" alt="Snowy Sad Face"></p>
<p>Snowy could use some design love, so <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=1413">we blogged about that</a> and created a <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Snowy/DesignerPlayground">Designer Playground on the wiki</a>. Add your mockups and we’re looking for help if you can make those mockups come to life!</p>
<p>We created a <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/tomboy-online-list">mailing list</a> that users can opt-in to for Tomboy Online news, release announcements and non-development type stuff.</p>
<p>OpenID support for creating accounts and logging in received some love. When completed, it will look similar to what <a href="https://bitbucket.org/account/signin/">bitbucket</a> uses from a UI perspective.</p>
<p>We’re also working on <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/snowy-list/2010-August/msg00012.html">creating a proposal to send to the GNOME Board to have a Snowy hackfest</a>. We are discussing the goals of what we want to accomplish, who can come, where to have it and when. If you’re interested, join the mailing list, now is a great time to get involved!</p>
<p>Lastly, we’re hoping to launch the Snowy alpha test with a handful (and I really mean a handful) of testers on September 13th. For more information, <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Snowy/FAQ">we wrote a FAQ</a> on the upcoming alpha test, which is required reading – there will be a test next time! After the first invites go out, we hope to add more participants weekly as we work towards an open beta. Alpha testers will be expected to file bugs, give feedback and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pay to be in the beta<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><em>Did you know? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintin_(character)">TinTin</a> was <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/network/2004/10/18/graphics/tomboy-recent.jpg">Tomboy’s first icon / logo</a> in GNOME on the panel.</em></p>

            <description>The Tomboy Online / Snowy team needs your help! We have an alpha instance of Tomboy Online up and running thanks to the wonderful GNOME Sysadmin team and we even have some new contributors helping with Snowy’s code (hi Jeff!).
But we need help! We need help with the web design for Tomboy Online and we’ll need help implementing it.
First, the design. Here’s what we have today:

<p>(<em>Click through to see a larger screenshot</em>).</p>
<p>And that’s just the home page after you log in. We need help with how to display a note, your list of notes, and editing notes. (Hope I’m not scaring you away yet!) And that’s just off the top of my head – I’m sure there’s more that I’m missing. (Update:  <a href="http://automorphic.blogspot.com/2009/05/tomboy-0151-release-brings-new-online.html">Sandy’s blog post shows some more screenshots</a>, including a page with a list of notes).</p>
<p>Do you have wicked web design skills? Have some time to put together some mockups? Are you able to take feedback well? Then we’re looking for <strong>YOU</strong>. I don’t even care about workflow right now. You can join the Snowy mailing list, you can email me with questions, you can join us in IRC in #snowy on irc.gimpnet.org, you can blog it about it and let us know – we’d just love to see some mockups so we can then go <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hunting for a sucker<!-- raw HTML omitted --> looking for a volunteer to bring your design to life.</p>
<p>Manuel started <a href="http://manuel-uewwy.posterous.com/mockups-for-tomboy-snowy-tomboy-online">work on this potential design</a> last year and we’re looking for help to build on that or for something new. But we need help in building iterations of it and moving forward.</p>
<p>Tomboy Online, <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Snowy">powered by Snowy</a>, will be one of <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>‘s first web services with application integration. Get the <a href="http://git.gnome.org/cgit/snowy">code here</a>, learn more about our <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Snowy/FAQ">upcoming alpha here</a> or <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/snowy-list">join our mailing list here</a>. You will be able to sync your Tomboy notes to the web using GNOME’s Tomboy Online service or your own server running Snowy.

<p>And thank you in advance for your help!</p>

            <description>I need some help! I’m looking for pictures from last year’s Boston Summit. They can be anything – hallway conversations, speakers, shooting pool after the talks. Anyone have any links or photos they can share? Flickr and Google didn’t turn up a lot of results.
Thanks!</description>

            <description>Jorge Castro and I were talking this morning in #banshee as Jorge asked if it was possible to create a smart playlist to see your music purchases.
And it is!
Jorge’s idea was for the UbuntuOne music store from 7digital.com. I don’t use Ubuntu, but I do buy (too many) songs from Amazon.
Amazon adds a comment in the metadata of each song you buy, such as: Amazon.com Song ID: 216030141 (If you’re curious, it’s the song Drunk Girls by LCD Soundsystem that I bought this morning for only $5!</description>

<p>Create a smart playlist in Banshee by choosing from the menu Media -&gt; New Smart Playlist.</p>
<p>Name your playlist (I used “Amazon”) and select “<code>Match all of the following</code>” and</p>
<p>“<code>Comment</code>” “<code>contains</code>” and enter “<code>Amazon.com Song ID:</code>” and press “<code>Save</code>“.</p>
<p>Voila! One smart playlist is created that shows all of your Amazon purchases. And since it’s so smart, when you buy new music it automatically updates the playlist (Yes, I bought another album this morning, don’t tell my wife). You can do the same for the UbuntuOne store using “Purchased from 7digital.com” instead of the Amazon Song ID: in the smart playlist comment.</p>

<p>But I’m here at GUADEC and we had a good Board meeting – it was good to see some faces I haven’t seen in a while and meet new ones. I spent most of today (had to leave a bit early to fix my phone) in the Open Desktop Day learning about large deployments of GNOME around the world.</p>
<p>Last year was my first GUADEC, which still is mostly a blur. I’m looking forward to seeing everyone again and would love to chat – just grab me (assuming I’m not already talking to somebody!) and I’d love to hear your thoughts about how GNOME is doing, what you’re working (or I’m working on!), GNOME 3.0 or anything that else comes to mind.</p>

            <description>Prince’s Purple Rain will also hold a special place for me as it was the first album I ever purchased. Oh, I had owned some 45s up until that point, but growing up I spent my summers at my grandparents house, and I remember as an eleven year old walking from their house to the local record store and buying it.
I think my grandparents, and my parents for that matter, might not have let an eleven year old buy the album considering some of the lyrics.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Prince’s Purple Rain will also hold a special place for me as it was the first album I ever purchased.  Oh, I had owned some 45s up until that point, but growing up I spent my summers at my grandparents house, and I remember as an eleven year old walking from their house to the local record store and buying it.</p>
<p>I think my grandparents, and my parents for that matter, might not have let an eleven year old buy the album considering some of the lyrics.</p>
<p>﻿﻿<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thejcgerm/4391279218/" title="Purple Rain by thejcgerm, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>

<p>It would be almost 10 years later when I would have my brush with fame and Prince, and I have always remained a huge Prince fan. I currently live about five miles from his studio and a half hour from First Avenue where the songs from Purple Rain were first tested and the movie was later filmed at.</p>
<p>Everyone knows how the album starts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dearly beloved</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are gathered here today</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 get through this thing called life</p>
<p>Electric word life</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It means forever and that’s a mighty long time</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But I’m here 2 tell u</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s something else</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The afterworld</p>
<p>A world of never ending happiness</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>U can always see the sun, day or night</p>
<p>So when u call up that shrink in Beverly Hills</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>U know the one – Dr Everything’ll Be Alright</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of asking him how much of your time is left</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask him how much of your mind, baby</p>
<p>‘Cuz in this life</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Things are much harder than in the afterworld</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this life</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re on your own</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, Prince kicks it into high gear and we’re off on one of the best musical journeys ever to be recorded as a motion picture soundtrack.</p>
<p>Prince then slows it down for <em>Take Me With U</em> and <em>The Beautiful Ones</em>.  Take me With U is the only song on the album to feature Purple Rain’s female lead, Apollonia, and was orginally intended for her solo album that was never released.  <em>The Beautiful Ones</em>, of the two songs, is much less well known, but to me, the better of the two.  It is a classic 1980s ballad as only Prince could create, with the talking voiceover, the synthesizers and Prince’s trademark falsetto.  Prince ups the tempo and the volume towards the end of the song practically screaming “<em>Do you want me? Cause I want you!</em>”</p>
<p>Purple Rain was Prince’s first album to feature the Revolution, Prince’s band, led by Wendy &amp; Lisa, who years later would go on to score the popular NBC TV show <em>Heroes</em>.  Wendy &amp; Lisa kick off the fourth track_, Computer Blue_, in an up-tempo song features Prince’s catchy hooks with a long instrumental segment in the middle that transitions to a beautiful guitar solo towards the end of the song.</p>
<p>Side one ends with <em>Darling Nikki</em>, which found popularity in the late 90s thanks to a cover by the Foo Fighters.</p>
<p>Side two starts off with the lead single, <em>When Doves Cry</em>, Prince’s first song to hit number on in the U.S, topping the charts for five weeks straight.  Over twenty-five years later, I still vividly remember the video for this song featuring scenes from the movie and Prince riding his motorcycle.</p>
<p><em>I Would Die 4 U</em> was the fourth and last single from Purple Rain went on to become another top ten hit.  At only 2:49, it is the shortest song on the album but still packs quite a punch.  <em>Baby I’m a Star</em> was recorded live at First Avenue in 1983, where Prince auditioned a number of songs from Purple Rain for the filming of the movie that was still more than 6 months away.  That concert at First Avenue ranks as one of the top 5 concerts I would go to if I had my own TARDIS.</p>
<p>The title song from the film and the album ends the album.  What can you say about this song that hasn’t already been said?  At almost nine minutes long, this was another song that was recorded at First Avenue live.  From it’s opening guitar to the gospel elements that come to mind when the organ starts, Purple Rain takes you on an emotional journey that features almost all of Prince’s trademarks captured in one song.</p>
<p>I purchased this album just weeks after it’s anniversary in June, used, at Down in the Valley.  Prince albums are semi-rare here in the Twin Cities, and one of the clerks turned to the other to point out what I was buying.  The second clerk lit up like a Christmas tree and I distinctly received the impression that if she had known it was in the store she might have bought it herself.  Both clerks liked my choice, not knowing the historical significance this classic Prince album holds for me.  This is an album I will cherish for a long time, both for the music and the sentimental memories.</p>

            <description>Welcome to Vinyl (R)Evolution – where I talk about the music I love. I can guarantee that my tastes are not your tastes but I’m confident you’ll find a story now and then that you can relate to.
I grew up listening to my parents music, which included artists such as ABBA, Billy Joel, Elton John and Cat Stevens. I hit my teenage years in the mid to late 80s and I started getting into 80s pop music, some hair metal bands, and hard rock before finally getting into grunge in the 90s and staying with that as it morphed into alternative and indie rock.</description>

I hit my teenage years in the mid to late 80s and I started getting into 80s pop music, some hair metal bands, and hard rock before finally getting into grunge in the 90s and staying with that as it morphed into alternative and indie rock. And I love the Bee Gees and some disco music for some reason that absolutely drives my wife crazy.  (<a href="http://www.vinylevolution.com/?p=15">More on all that here</a>).</p>
<p>Why the name Vinyl (R)Evolution with the funky parentheses? Listening to vinyl records is both a revolution in my listening habits and an evolution of myself as I become a more discerning music lover.</p>
<p>I’m hoping to talk about a few different things each week on this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>New records I’ve purchased that week and mini-reviews of the album.</li>
<li>At least one review a week of a used record I’ve purchased since I started collecting records again in April on <a href="http://www.recordstoreday.com/Home">Record Store Day</a>.</li>
<li>Visits to my local records stores.</li>
<li>Other new music I’ve purchased that I think is worth talking about that I may have bought on CD or MP3.</li>
</ul>

            <description>It’s hard to top the purchases I made last week, which included a used copy of Prince’s Purple Rain and the new albums by The Black Keys and Broken Bells, but this week saw a couple of good albums released.
I received of Montreal’s 12″ single The Past is a Grotesque Animal, which may be the most beautiful album I’ve ever purchased. (More on it here). This was the only vinyl purchase of the week and I bought two digital albums.</description>

<p>I received of Montreal’s 12″ single <em>The Past is a Grotesque Animal</em>, which may be the most beautiful album I’ve ever purchased. (<a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/vinyl/?p=22">More on it here</a>). This was the only vinyl purchase of the week and I bought two digital albums.</p>
<p>On the local front, Cloud Cult released <em>Light Chasers</em> on their own Earthology Records and is their eighth studio album. From the email release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…this latest full-length draws most of it’s inspiration from the joy (and worries) of rebirth – Craig (singer/songwriter) and Connie (live painter) welcomed a healthy baby boy into their lives this past fall – after a long grieving process of the loss of their first son Kaiden. Light Chasers is a concept album that interweaves stories focused on the exploration of the mysteries of the universe, life and death. It’s a 56 minute journey with no audio breaks that explores love and loss and searches for the light at the end of the tunnel. It also lends itself beautifully into Cloud Cult’s vision that albums should be seen as a whole versus the modern trend of focusing on singles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love the fact they focus on the whole album experience – and it shows on this album. It’s just as good as their prior two releases and is a bit more mellow. The songs seamlessly flow together (make sure you can play it back using gapless playback!) and the track titles are perfectly named. I’ll always remember Cloud Cult as it was the first MP3 album I ever bought using Amazon’s MP3 service when it first launched. If you get a chance to see them live, don’t miss it – they combine their music with a visual artist on stage and it’s a concert experience you’ve never seen before. The album is available everywhere September 14th or you can <a href="http://www.cloud-cult.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=68">buy it digitally now directly from Cloud Cult here</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite album I bought, though, is Alejandro Escovedo’s latest, <em>Street Songs of Love</em>. One genre of music you’ll never find me reviewing on this blog is country music – but I love what they call “alt-country” with artists such as Ryan Adams, The Jayhawks, Wilco, Drive By Truckers, and yes, Alejandro Escovedo.</p>
<p>You may know him better through his progeny – his son Pete plays with Carlos Santana and his daughter is Sheila E, but Alejandro Escovedo has had a long music career that started with punk rock and is still going strong.</p>
<p>It was his last album, 2008’s <em>Real Animals</em>, that introduced me to him, and if you like that album, you will love this album. Street Songs of Love is slightly more uptempo than <em>Real Animals</em> and starts with a bang with the first track, Anchor. Other songs of note are Down in the Bowery, with Hunter, the lead singer from Mott the Hoople; Fall Apart With You is a wonderful ballad that will stay with you for days; Bruce Springsteen guests on Faith; and the album ends with a perfect denouement, the instrumental Fort Worth Blue.</p>
<p>I was ecstatic when Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FBNIV4/ref=s9_simh_gw_p15_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0ASJH99Q9XVJFJNSM8ED&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938631&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">lowered the MP3 price from $10.49 to $7.99</a> on Wednesday and it’s been worth every penny. You can <a href="http://www.spinner.com/new-releases#/4">listen to the whole album as a stream on Spinner</a>.</p>

            <description>It’s quite fitting the day after I launched the blog that the most beautiful record I’ve purchased yet should be delivered.

of Montreal has released a 12″ album on the Polyvinyl label of The Past is a Grotesque Animal, originally recorded for Spike Jonze’s I’M HERE. It comes on light blue vinyl with a hand screen printed design by Nina / Geminitactics.
Polyvinyl is a small label out of Champaign, Illinois and features a number of indie artists that I’ve been lucky to hear on my local radio station, 89.</description>

<p><a href="http://www.ofmontreal.net">of Montreal</a> has released a 12″ album on the <a href="http://www.polyvinylrecords.com/">Polyvinyl</a> label of <a href="http://www.ofmontreal.net/2010/06/08/the-past-is-a-grotesque-animal-12/">The Past is a Grotesque Animal</a>, originally recorded for Spike Jonze’s I’M HERE.  It comes on light blue vinyl with a hand screen printed design by Nina / Geminitactics.</p>
<p>Polyvinyl is a small label out of Champaign, Illinois and features a number of indie artists that I’ve been lucky to hear on my local radio station, 89.3 The Current.  Polyvinyl is home to of Montreal, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin, Joan of Arc and is the former home for Mates of State.  Last year they had a bit of financial trouble, and <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mattlunsford/help-us-save-our-office">using Kickstarter they had a sale</a> to save 10,000 records from destruction.  For only $20 I received 8 CDs that served as a great introduction to the artists on their label.</p>
<p>of Montreal was one of those artists I received a further introduction too, receiving their <em>Icons, Abstract Thee</em> CD.  Kevin Barnes is the man behind the project, having released 9 of Montreal albums, with the tenth coming out later this year (and <a href="http://www.polyvinylrecords.com/store/index.php?id=1287">available via pre-sale now</a>.  And yes, I pre-ordered the limited edition red LP package).</p>
<p><em>The Past is a Grotesque</em> record features two versions of the song, the second with The Lost Trees.  The song features of Montreal’s trademark catchiness and is also haunting in a way – but the vocals are like nothing done on an of Montreal record before.</p>
<p>I’ve listened to it a few times, and while it may not be my favorite song by of Montreal, it’s probably the favorite record I’ve purchased so far.  The record is a beautiful sky blue and the picture below doesn’t do it justice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4744193020/" title="sdc10169.jpg by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>This is the first vinyl record I’ve purchased from Polyvinyl, but it won’t be the last.  I already have pre-orders in for of Montreal’s next album, False Priest, and Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin’s August release Let it Sway.  Polyvinyl, and more importantly, their artists get how the music industry is changing – you can order the CD or LP – both with the album in MP3 available on release date,  as well as packages containing t-shirts, buttons or stickers.  It’s good to see at least one label who understands <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/rtb.php">CwF + RtB (Connect with Fans) + (Reason to Buy)</a>.  And they sent me some bonus items with my of Montreal purchase:  The ZZZZ’s latest album, a poster and a pink lemonade Airheads!</p>

            <description>I’ve been a bit of a distro-hopper over the last year, but as I started interviewing at Novell earlier this year I started using openSUSE so I could pretend to know what I was talking about if it came up during the interview process.
I’ve been really happy with openSUSE – each distro has their quirks but there’s a number of things (especially the openSUSE Build Service!) it does well.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been a bit of a distro-hopper over the last year, but as I started interviewing at Novell earlier this year I started using <a href="http://www.opensue.org">openSUSE</a> so I could pretend to know what I was talking about if it came up during the interview process.</p>
<p>I’ve been really happy with openSUSE – each distro has their quirks but there’s a number of things (especially the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service">openSUSE Build Service</a>!) it does well.</p>
<p>I’ve also enjoyed lurking in the openSUSE GNOME community. When I’ve been stuck with something I’ve gotten quick answers and they’ve been very welcoming. (Well, except Vincent – he took one look at what I did to my laptop at the Marketing hackfest and ran away. Ok, that’s not true, he fixed it as he usually does).</p>
<p>One of the cool things the openSUSE community is doing is organizing the second annual <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_Conf_2010">openSUSE conference later this year from October 21st – 23rd in Nuremberg, Germany</a>.</p>
<p>The theme is “Collaboration Across Borders” and this goes beyond just openSUSE – one of the tracks being tentatively planned is called “Cross Pollination” and the goal is to have multiple distributions and upstream projects under one roof. There will be open discussions and meetings, presentations and maybe even some hacking together. (For those of you hoping for a cagematch fight, sorry!)</p>
<p>Potential topics could include anything from accessibility to how to handle zealots in your community to what holds a project back to brainstorming about how closed competition might do better and how our projects can improve.</p>
<p>If this sounds like something you may be interested in presenting at – no matter what distribution you may use or support – distributions and upstream projects welcome! – email <a href="mailto:cfp@opensuse.org">cfp@opensuse.org</a> to propose a talk.</p>
<p>Thanks to FunkyPenguin aka awafaa for passing this along.</p>

            <description>What’s that? You follow planet.gnome.org but not news.gnome.org? For shame – we have a blog for the GNOME Documentation team but I guess this once I can cross-post for you.
We’re having a meeting tomorrow at 19:00 UTC in #docs on irc.gimp.org to start planning the topics and task for GNOME 3.0. We have big things (like GNOME Shell) to document and lots of little topics to tackle as we break up the old GNOME User Guide and organize it better.</description>

            <description>Gizmodo and Lifehacker’s Kevin Purdy both have blog posts on Father’s Day today talking about what their dads taught them about technology. Building on that theme, I can thank my dad for getting me interested in computers at a young age.
I was 9 years old when my dad bought the family its first computer, the Timex Sinclair 1000 (the American version of the Sinclair ZX81). Small and compact with a whopping 2KiB of RAM, we hooked it up to an old black and white television and used a tape deck to load and save programs.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5568058/what-our-dads-taught-us-about-tech">Gizmodo</a> and Lifehacker’s <a href="http://thepurdman.com/what-my-dad-taught-me-about-tech/">Kevin Purdy</a> both have blog posts on Father’s Day today talking about what their dads taught them about technology. Building on that theme, I can thank my dad for getting me interested in computers at a young age.</p>
<p>I was 9 years old when my dad bought the family its first computer, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_1000">Timex Sinclair 1000</a> (the American version of the Sinclair ZX81). Small and compact with a whopping 2KiB of RAM, we hooked it up to an old black and white television and used a tape deck to load and save programs. My dad also bought the 16K ram expansion module and later the TS1500 which had 16K ram of built-in and was slightly bigger with a better keyboard. I remember spending hours copying machine code from computer magazines and hoping I didn’t make a mistake so I could play a game like Breakout or loading pre-bought tapes with games to play. A few years ago when my dad came to visit, he surprised me and brought me both computers (in their original boxes!), manuals and a bunch of tapes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4541203303/" title="Timex Sinclair by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>A few years later he bought an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_//c">Apple //c</a> and I spent probably thousands of hours with it over the years. I remember playing games like Choplifter to The Bards Tale, programming BASIC and Logo and later, having a modem and finding the wonderful world of BBSes. I remember we had Compuserve briefly (it was expensive!) and I think I spent a few hours playing one of their RPGs, but I don’t remember if I got yelled at for the hourly fee. I remember that we had an early modem and when we upgraded (to maybe 1200 baud?) how excited I was because how much faster it was. A number of years ago I bought an Apple //c and accompanying monitor. I never did find the space in the house to set it up and there it sits in its box…</p>
<p>I don’t remember my dad using any of the computers all that much – probably because I was hogging them every minute I could. I think he did some home finance stuff, but I wouldn’t say my dad is a computer expert by any means. I look at my son today who sit on his PC and play games for hours at a time, and now that summer is here, I think to myself he should get outside and get some exercise and fresh air – and now I’ve officially turned into my father.</p>
<p>A few years later we would get a 286 running GeoS, not MS-DOS. I remember being at Sears, and being smart-mouthed and opinionated like any teenager, telling my dad to invest the money in the 386. We got the 286 and a year or two later I still remember vividly getting Wing Commander – but I needed MS-DOS 5 to use the himem command so I could play it and talking my dad in to taking me to Babbages and buying it for me.</p>
<p>That computer lived in my room and I don’t have any memories of my father using it. I’m sure I’ve never said it, but thanks dad for buying these computers for me as a kid, it played a large part in forming who I am today.</p>
<p>Last summer my son and I talked about using some of his free time to constructively use his computer (rather than all the games he loves to play). Just this morning we were talking on the way home from breakfast about carving some time out every day on a consistent basis and going through <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/06/10/cc-licensed-book-on.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+boingboing/iBag+(Boing+Boing)">Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python</a>. Between that and <a href="http://www.briggs.net.nz/log/writing/snake-wrangling-for-kids/">Snake Wrangling for Kid</a>s he may pick up some programming skills this summer, something I never did.</p>
<p>My daughter has one of my old laptops, and plays <a href="http://gcompris.net/">GCompris</a> on it, and I downloaded <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick">Sugar on a Stick</a> last week for her to try out too. I hope my kids can look back someday, as I am today, and remember the experiences of using their first computer as fondly as I do today.</p>

            <description>When I was 17 or18 years old, I wanted to be a DJ with a friend of mine. I grabbed all of my parents vinyl records, trucked them over to my friend’s house and then… we didn’t do anything. He and I eventually had a falling out and a couple years later when I inquired about getting the records back, I was dismayed to learn that his basement had flooded and they were trashed.</description>

I grabbed all of my parents vinyl records, trucked them over to my friend’s house and then… we didn’t do anything. He and I eventually had a falling out and a couple years later when I inquired about getting the records back, I was dismayed to learn that his basement had flooded and they were trashed.</p>
<p>I don’t think my father has forgiven me to this day.</p>
<p>I grew up heavily influenced by music, including my parents listening to their records and favorite artists such as ABBA, Billy Joel and Elton John. I remember periods of my life based on the music I was listening to at the time and if I hear a specific song it can take me back right to that moment.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about buying a turntable for the last few years and re-creating some of those memories. I participated in <a href="http://www.recordstoreday.com/Home">Record Store Day</a> last year shopping at a <a href="http://www.electricfetus.com/">local store</a> and picking up a number of CDs and this year on Record Store Day I went out and this time picked up some <a href="http://www.downinthevalley.com/">used and new vinyl records</a> and then bought a turntable off Craigslist. (An early 80s Pioneer direct-drive).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4563237726/" title="img_5174.jpg by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>I’m one of growing number of people getting back into vinyl – just visit <a href="http://futureofvinyl.com/">The Future of Vinyl blog</a> for non-stop <a href="http://www.creativedeconstruction.com/2009/06/resurgence-of-vinyl-could-be-just-what-the-music-industry-needs/">media</a> <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1702369,00.html#ixzz0XCmdjMU3">coverage</a> of the growth of vinyl over the last couple years – it’s now the fastest growing segment of the (dying) music industry. Even <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5229996/best-buy-may-start-selling-vinyl-records">large retailers like Best Buy</a> are getting in on it. (Though I found their selection disappointing – very few new records, just 180g re-issues of older material, and for the same prices as the local stores, who I would rather support).</p>
<p>I own more CDs than I can count, and even if it’s in my head, I do think vinyl sounds better. There is something to be said for the crackle and hiss of a well worn and loved album playing on a stereo.</p>
<p>I don’t know what’s more fun – listening to the albums or shopping for them. I’ve already bought over 60 records in the last 6 weeks, the bulk of them at two events. The first was a private collector who put an ad in Craigslist and was selling over 5000 records with most of them going for 3 for a dollar. The second sale was today at the <a href="http://www.mnrecordshow.com/record_show_main/the_record_show.html">Minnesota Record Show</a> which is held four times a year and features a number of dealers selling records for a few bucks each to rare albums worth hundreds of dollars. On average at an event like this or in the local record stores, used albums are about $3 each. I have bought a few re-issues on 180 gram vinyl of some of my favorite albums of all time, such as Depeche Mode’s Music for the Masses. (Most albums are 120 grams – the thicker the album the higher the fidelity).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4563236382/" title="img_5171.jpg by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>But what impresses me the most is the resurgence in current artists releasing vinyl day and date with CD – and including MP3 or FLAC downloads for free when you purchase the vinyl record. I’ve picked up some great new albums, including the latest from <a href="http://www.bluecollardistro.com/theholdsteady/categories.php?cPath=237">The Hold Steady</a>, <a href="http://www.matadorrecords.com/store/index.php?catalog_id=480">The New Pornographers</a> and <a href="http://www.sonymusicdigital.com/broken-bells/pages/5437030/">Broken Bells</a>.</p>
<p>My wife laughs at me every time I say “I’m going downstairs to listen to some records” but I’m enjoying the experience immensely. She also says I’m done collecting for a while, but don’t tell her, I have my eyes on some more new releases and I heard about another upcoming show…</p>

            <description>It’s been two months since I was appointed to the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors to replace Behdad. (And those are some pretty big shoes to fill!)
With Foundation Board elections quickly approaching, we discussed at the last Board meeting this past Thursday sharing some of our experiences on the Board. We would like to encourage anyone with an interest in running for the Board to do so and I thought I’d share some of my experiences over the last 2 months and I believe other Board members will be sharing theirs as well.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been two months since <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2010-March/msg00134.html">I was appointed to the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors to replace Behdad</a>. (And those are some pretty big shoes to fill!)</p>
<p>With <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2010-May/msg00000.html">Foundation Board elections quickly approaching</a>, we discussed at the last Board meeting this past Thursday sharing some of our experiences on the Board. We would like to encourage anyone with an interest in running for the Board to do so and I thought I’d share some of my experiences over the last 2 months and I believe other Board members will be sharing theirs as well.</p>
<p>Being the newest member of the Board, I have to say the experience has been eye opening and humbling. I do not consider myself a developer or progammer and I enjoy the other aspects of being involved with free software projects, including project management. I thought this would help prepare me for being on the Board, especially as the Board does not set technical direction for GNOME, but I am constantly amazed at the number of things the Board is involved in.</p>
<p>These things range from little things such as registering or transferring a domain to following up with a booth organizer on how a conference went to big things like GNOME’s finances, GUADEC planning or the hiring and payroll of GNOME’s employees and everything in-between.</p>
<p>There is a lot of work around GNOME’s finances. German, as Treasurer, has a huge task in helping managing and tracking GNOME’s income and expenses. Stormy and Rosanna also spend a significant amount of time in dealing with the administrative side of this in managing the bank accounts, wire transfers and more.</p>
<p>A lot of what we do is interacting with the various project teams. Things like getting an update from the Release Team on how the next release is coming or the challenges ahead or asking the Marketing team to help with fundraising ideas. And there is the follow-up – being a free software project powered by developers there can be a lot of follow-up in both just getting a response or update as well as progress on any given project or task. I don’t know how we’d do it without Brian’s (as Secretary) attention to detail in keeping the meeting minutes. (You are <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2010-May/msg00003.html">reading the meeting minutes</a> after Brian sends them to the Foundation list every two weeks, aren’t you?)</p>
<p>There is also a focus on events. From planning GUADEC (did you know we’re aleady working on the Desktop Summit for 2011 to be co-hosted with KDE?) to hackfests we are constantly working on planning future events and following-up to see how past events went and what their accomplishments were.</p>
<p>We also work with external partners. Examples include companies or organizations who want to work together, journalists, government organizations or our Advisory Board partners. We meet with the Advisory Board monthly and have a two-way discussion on how we can work together better. This past Tuesday’s meeting Stormy and German gave an update on GNOME’s finances as we are half way through our fiscal year.</p>
<p>Doing a very, very rough estimate, I would say we average about 50 emails a week (just doing a quick count over the past few weeks). Some of it is conversation between Board members to make a decision, some of it just votes on a decision (+1, 0 or -1) and some it is discussions with projects or partners. Everyone on the Board has a voice and we have a good discussion and dialog as we build consensus. If you think about it, it’s only 5-10 emails per day – not as many as you think!</p>
<p>If you are good at communication, have knowlege about GNOME, are comfortable in taking on action items and following through, have some time you can donate each week, and most importantly, want to see the GNOME Foundation grow and succeed, you should consider running for the Board.</p>
<p>This blog post isn’t supposed to scare you off – if you’re choosing to run you should be aware of the administrative tasks and time involved but the work is deeply rewarding. Being a part of the Board has given me a broader vision to all the great things GNOME does around the world and I am thankful for the opportunity.</p>
<p>With that said, the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2010-May/msg00000.html">elections process kicked off a week ago</a>. I’ll be the first to put my hand up this election cycle and announce my candidacy. I’ve sent in my email to the Foundation-Announce and Elections lists and it should be moderated and appear soon. I would be honored and humbled to serve the GNOME community on the Board for the next year.</p>
<p>You should run too. Help make GNOME better. Yes, you.</p>

            <title>Quack – An update on GNOME 3.0 Help</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2010/05/quack-an-update-on-gnome-3-0-help/</link>

            <description>One of the big improvements for GNOME 3.0 is new user help. The Documentation Team is using Mallard to re-write the GNOME User Guide and a number of applications help files as well.
In GNOME today, most help files are written in a very linear structure by chapter using Docbook XML. If you’re a user looking for help, it’s not always easy to find the right chapter that contains the topic you’re looking for help with.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the big improvements for GNOME 3.0 is new user help.  The <a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject">Documentation Team</a> is using <a href="http://www.projectmallard.org">Mallard</a> to re-write the GNOME User Guide and a number of applications help files as well.</p>
<p>In GNOME today, most help files are written in a very linear structure by chapter using Docbook XML.  If you’re a user looking for help, it’s not always easy to find the right chapter that contains the topic you’re looking for help with.</p>
<p>Topic based help aims to fix that.  And to write topic based help, the GNOME Docs team will be using Mallard, a new XML language written by <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/shaunm">Shaun McCance</a> aka the GNOME Documentation Project’s Fearless Leader.</p>
<p>The hardest part about writing good help (in any markup) is <strong>planning, planning, planning</strong>.  <em>What feature might the user need help with?</em> <em>Where will they get stuck?</em> <em>How should the topics be organized?</em></p>
<p>From there, you write help that’s in the second person in a conversational tone to help the user.  (And choosing the right words is important as well to help the localization teams out, too).</p>
<p>Let’s use <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/">Tomboy’s</a> help to compare.</p>
<p>Tomboy help in GNOME 2.30 using Docbook:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.paulcutler.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/tomboy2-30.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Tomboy help re-written into topic based help for GNOME 3.0:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(And there are a number of topics you can’t see in the screenshot such as Common Problems, Advanced Actions and What’s New.)</p>
<p>The goal is to help users get to the help they need fast.  There’s always been a bit of an in-joke that users don’t read the help.  We’re aiming to change that.  When they need help, we need to present it quickly and easily.  (Which also ties in to the work <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/shaunm/2010/03/11/more-yelp-3-0-location-entry/">Shaun is doing in Yelp 3.0</a>).</p>
<p>For GNOME 3.0, we are going to re-write the GNOME User Guide.  This will be a difficult challenge due to the amount of information currently in the guide as well as GNOME Shell and the user interface being in development and we need for it to stabilize before writing the docs.  Shaun, Milo and Phil did a lot of planning around the user guide at the Desktop Help Summit this past April in Chicago.</p>
<p>In addition to this herculean task, a number of applications are in process of getting new help or replacing their old help with topic based help, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Banshee</li>
<li>Brasero</li>
<li>Cheese</li>
<li>F-Spot</li>
<li>gLabels</li>
<li>Rhythmbox</li>
<li>Tomboy</li>
</ul>
<p>On a personal note, I finished Tomboy’s help and started Banshee’s help this weekend on the plane coming back from the Marketing hackfest.  I’d also like to thank Harold Schreckengost who just joined the docs team last month and has already started, if not finished, topic based help for Brasero and F-Spot.  (I committed the F-Spot help tonight on his behalf in a new branch – <em>docs</em>).</p>
<p>If you’re an application developer and you know of your help being written or re-written in Mallard, please <a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Planning">add it to the list on the wiki</a>.  App maintainers also may need to re-work the way help is called from the menu and help the doc writers review any new documentation for accuracy.  (<em>Thanks in advance!</em>)</p>
<p>If you’re a documentation writer, please visit the page above as well for examples on how we plan our writing for help and the Docs wiki has a lot of other great information for getting started too.  Take it from me, writing in Mallard is much easier than Docbook, and now is a great time to get involved with the Docs team and writing new user help as we’re all learning the new language and we can make a big impact on GNOME 3.0.</p>

            <description>A handful of us are waiting in the hotel lobby to catch a cab to the train station as the Marketing Hackfest has come to an end. Andreas has inspired me to stop procrastinating and write another blog post (hopefully it’s not the last one about the hackfest!)
Our trip here was sponsored and organized by multiple groups including ASOLIF, Technological Institute of Aragón, CESLA, the city of Zaragosa and the regional government Aragón.</description>

<p>A handful of us are waiting in the hotel lobby to catch a cab to the train station as the Marketing Hackfest has come to an end. Andreas has inspired me to stop procrastinating and write another blog post (hopefully it’s not the last one about the hackfest!)</p>
<p>Our trip here was sponsored and organized by multiple groups including ASOLIF, Technological Institute of Aragón, CESLA, the city of Zaragosa and the regional government Aragón.  (See the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Hackfests/Marketing-2010-05">Hackfest page for more details under organizers</a>).  I would personally like to thank Agustin for taking such good care of us and making sure we got from one place to another.</p>
<p>Our days were very structured – start hacking at 9 until 2:00 when we would break for lunch, then start again at 4:00 (or at least that’s when we were supposed to start – Spain is very relaxed and have long lunches) and then hack some more until 8:30 or so when the facility closed.  Walk back to the hotel and then meet for dinner and walk to a location around 9:30.  Agustin was kind enough to explain some of the cultural significance in why this is and it was a good learning experience.</p>
<p>Being your typical American this took some getting used to!</p>
<p>We spent our time hacking in the “Water Library” or Bibliotecha de Agua (I hope I got that right as I don’t speak Spanish).  The library was converted from a convent (if I remember correctly) and the picture above is the room just outside our conference room.    Walking through the library some rooms had display cases explaining the history of the building and the city.</p>
<p>Each day after lunch Stormy, Vincent and myself would meet with officials from the local or regional government, the university or businesses in Spain who are using free software and are interested in growing their community and giving back.  The city of Zaragoza is marketing itself as an Open Source City and is building infrastructure to retain and attract technology companies and startups as well as helping its citizens through things like free Wifi.  (More on Zaragoza in another post – it deserves it’s own blog post for all the cool things they’re doing).</p>
<p>Some of the business leaders we met with traveled hours by train to meet with us and we were honored to learn about what they’re doing in and with free software and how they want to give back to the community.  We were able to share our knowledge of working within free software communities and I’m excited to see these companies grow and expand.</p>
<p>One local example is <a href="http://www.ebox-platform.com/">eBox</a>.  From their website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>eBox Platform can act as a Gateway, Infrastructure Manager, Unified Threat Manager, Office Server, Unified Communication Server or a combination of them. One single, easy-to-use platform to manage all your network services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ignacio, eBox’s CEO, spent a significant amount of time with us joining us for lunch and dinner every single day.  We were also able to get a tour of their offices after the session on Friday.  Heidi, their Chief Marketing Officer also joined us for dinner one night and on Friday.</p>
<p>On Friday, the government <a href="http://www.gistain.net/?p=4509">hosted a day of talks</a> that included local businesses and other free software speakers, including Rodrigo Moya from GNOME Hispano, and Stormy, Vincent and myself each gave talks.  It was a fantastic opportunity to participate with such a diverse group and being able to represent GNOME.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone in and around Zaragoza for spending time us and sharing the exciting things you’re doing and the goals you have in building free software and communities.  It was definitely a learning experience and one I’m thankful for.</p>

            <description>Ten brave souls have gathered in windy Zaragoza, Spain for a GNOME Marketing Hackfest to work on a marketing plan and materials for the upcoming GNOME 3.0 launch.

Day one is already done and we’re well on our way into day two and we’re getting a lot of stuff done.
Sumana has done a great job at summarizing our first day and she’s jumped in and volunteered to act as our project manager.</description>

<p>We’re working on a GNOME 3 website where we can host some cool videos showing the features and benefits of GNOME 3 as well as making it easy to represent GNOME at events.  We’re working on presentations and templates you could use to give a talk about GNOME, materials to host a booth at a conference such as SCALE or Ohio Linux Fest and more.</p>
<p>Even Vincent is surprised how much we are getting done:</p>

            <description>Dave Neary wrote an interesting blog post yesterday commenting that the recruitment of new developers appears to be slowing.
I’ve had similar a similar thought on my mind for a while but coming from a different angle.
First though, revisiting Dave’s thought, he writes:

<p>But it was a learning experience. Installing Linux was the period in my life where I learned the most about how computers worked, hardware and software.

</blockquote>
<p>I had a conversation with Jono Bacon and Opportunistic Development (more on this in a different post) at the Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit two weeks ago that comes to mind.  Jono and I were talking about how kids in the 80’s had a chance to learn to program through BASIC, LOGO or other languages.  I remember using my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4541203303/">first computer</a> and buying magazines that had the machine code you’d program in by hand to create a game.  (Ok, I’m old).</p>
<p>But it leads me to an interesting thought about the evolution of younger users and how they are introduced to computers, becoming programmers and ultimately hackers or makers.</p>

<li>In the early 80’s we had the TRS-80, Commodore or Apple II (and later the Atari ST or IBM PC) computers and were encouraged to learn Basic or LOGO</li>
<li>In the 90’s we saw the beginning of Linux and other free software tools that raised a different generation of hackers.  We had the World Wide Web explode creating a generation of Web programmers.</li>
<li>And in the first decade of the 21st century, especially the second half, we saw the rise of the smartphone and the app store.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dave asks the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it any wonder that recruitment of developers appears to be slowing, that prominent older projects are suffering something of a demographic crisis, with hoary old 30 year olds holding down the fort, with no young fiery whippersnappers coming up to relieve them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(And I encourage you to read the comments on his blog as well).  I don’t know if that’s the right question – I think the fiery whippersnappers have more choices today for development – web apps, iPhone or Android apps, Linux and more.</p>
<p>For the GNOME community specifically, I wonder if we could make it easier for new developers or projects.  As an upstream project, I understand we don’t want to make it too easy and have a wasteland of abandoned projects hosted on our infrastructure, but I also see innovative new projects like <a href="http://zeitgeist-project.com/">Zeitgeist</a> or <a href="http://gtg.fritalk.com/">Getting Things GNOME!</a> using Launchpad instead.  I think the recent Zeitgeist proposal highlights both the benefits and challenges of using one or the other platforms for development.  I don’t know what the answer is, but I’d be curious to hear the communities opinion on it, whether it’s opening a GNOME branch on Gitorious or other ideas.</p>
<p>From whatever direction you come at these questions, it is an interesting challenge to have.</p>

            <description>Thank you to everyone who has worked, and more importantly, donated to to the GNOME Sysadmin campaign that was launched this week. Special thanks to Vinicius, Lucas, Stormy and everyone who has helped develop the ruler that is displayed on the family of GNOME websites.
It’s been almost a year since J5 blogged about the GNOME Foundation needing help – and since then we saw a lift in donations via Friends of GNOME.</description>

<p>It’s been almost a year since <a href="http://www.j5live.com/2009/04/30/the-gnome-foundation-needs-your-help/">J5 blogged about the GNOME Foundation needing help</a> – and since then we saw a lift in donations via Friends of GNOME. Thanks to Jaap Haitsma and the marketing team (I’m sure I’m forgetting somebody) we also <a href="http://www.gnome.org/friends/promote.html">launched Friends of GNOME buttons</a> for blogs and Amazon referrals to help raise money for GNOME.</p>
<p>While we’ve seen a <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/marketing-list/2010-March/msg00005.html">slight dip</a> in Friends of GNOME subscriptions in the last couple of months with subscribers who have reached the one year mark, we should all be proud and thankful for the money raised over the last year. We raised more money in 2009 than the last couple of years combined.</p>
<p>We’ll be launching a GNOME store soon to also help raise money (and help you get cool GNOME stuff!) and we have some ideas for 3.0 as well.</p>
<p>The Sysadmin campaign has been a great success and we want to be careful with specific fundraising campaigns going forward. There’s no question that marketing and promoting a fundraising campaign does have an effect based on this success!</p>
<p>Again, I’d like to thank everyone who has helped support GNOME financially. This is important to help fund hackfests around the globe which helps GNOME develop new features, applications and provide a better experience for all of our users. Thank you again.</p>
<p>(And check out <a href="http://robertogaloppini.net/2010/03/24/open-source-fundraising-campaigns-the-gnome-ruler/">Roberto Galoppini’s blog</a> too about the ruler).</p>

            <description>Stormy was kind enough to announce our next Marketing hackfest this week while I was out sick. (I’m such a slacker, always have an excuse!)
This hackfest is all about GNOME 3.0 marketing planning, preparation and execution. GNOME 3.0 coming this fall is a huge milestone for GNOME and our role as a marketing team is to have marketing and promotion materials ready to introduce our users to what GNOME 3.</description>

<p>The regional governments of Zaragoza and Aragon had previously reached out to GNOME as they are deploying free software within their governments and have kindly offered to help with hosting. Part of our role will also be to discuss GNOME and free software with them.</p>
<p>The hackfest is scheduled May 5th through the 7th and the details are on the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Hackfests/Marketing-2010-05">hackfest wiki page</a>. You will also find the agenda, hackfest goals and travel information.</p>
<p>If you are interested in coming, please add your name to the wiki page and please review the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Travel">GNOME Travel policies</a> if you would like to request a travel sponsorship / subsidy.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeMarketing/MarketingHackfest2009">first Marketing hackfest</a> late last year was a success and we learned a lot doing it. I’ll be working over the next week or two to make sure all of the previous hackfest work and information is updated and shared. (One thing I learned I could do better!)</p>

            <description>I’ve been meaning to follow-up on Shaun’s recent bog post about “Explain More” when writing user help. Zonker’s blog post this morning on how to write an interview finally motivated me to get this blog post done.
One of my favorite sayings in a work environment is “Plan the work and work the plan”. This applies to writing as well.
One of the two major takeaways I had last year after attending the first Writing Open Source conference was the importance of planning.</description>

<p>One of my favorite sayings in a work environment is “Plan the work and work the plan”. This applies to writing as well.</p>
<p>One of the two major takeaways I had last year after attending the first <a href="http://www.writingopensource.com/">Writing Open Source</a> conference was the importance of planning. At least for me, almost of all the heavy lifting and hard work is done in the planning phase. (Not that writing and editing are easy either, but the planning for me is where my brain works the hardest).</p>
<p>When I was in school, especially high school, all of my English teachers required an outline when writing a term paper. School was fairly easy for me and I’d just write the paper and then do the outline. Oh, how I wish I had listened to them and learned those skills then!</p>
<p>It’s fascinating to me reading novels and then reading about or listening to an author talk about the years they spent researching their book. After last year, it’s finally clicked for me. (Having just finished <a href="http://www.io9.com">io9</a>‘s recent book club selection, <em>The Windup Girl</em>, by Paolo Bacigalupi I found his answers in the <a href="http://io9.com/5480532/ask-paolo-bacigalupi-about-windup-">book club Q&amp;A</a> session fascinating, especially his research on Thailand and the Thai culture).</p>
<p>Planning your writing will help you connect with your readers, stay on message and help you faster. (Faster isn’t always better but you may spend less time getting stuck or if you do get stuck, be able to write the next section that you’ve planned and come back and finish where you were stuck).</p>
<p>Whether it’s user help, a blog post or an interview, spend some time thinking about what you want to write about and who your audience is. Your readers will thank you.</p>

            <description>Neil Gaiman continues to be one of my favorite authors (and tweeters). I bought a print of his poem “The Day the Saucers Came” in 2007 when it first came out and finally have gotten around to having it framed. (And I have #69 of 750 made, a nice low number!)
“The Day the Saucers Came” was originally published in Neil Gaiman’s short story collection, “Fragile Things” and was one of my favorite stories included.</description>

            <description>(This is reposted from an email earlier this evening)
Hi all, I wanted to give you a brief update on the GNOME Sysadmin team.
Last April, Owen sent out an email outlining changes to the Sysadmin team and a goal of hiring a part-time System Administrator to help coordinate the Sysadmin team. (And we’re getting closer to be the goal every day!)
Last year John Carr oversaw the team and the Sysadmin team was able to work on a number of improvements to the GNOME infrastructure, including a Bugzilla upgrade, installing a CRM system and web analytics application for the Marketing team and Plone, a CMS for a new www.</description>

<p>In October <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-infrastructure/2009-October/msg00020.html">I volunteered to help with coordinating the team as John stepped down</a> and with a new year starting a couple other members have indicated they don’t have time to help right now as well.</p>
<p>We have lots of improvements planned for this year such as bringing a brand new server online (thanks to Jeff Schroeder’s donation!) and migrating services from older servers to the new one, Git and Damned Lies integration, integrating all GNOME servers with Puppet and scoping Tomboy Online. That’s just to name a few – we also have a number of tasks open in Bugzilla in the sysadmin component.</p>
<p>We are looking for two volunteers to join the team to help with these projects and more. As Owen mentioned last year, team member responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attending the IRC meetings</li>
<li>Regularly spending time handling routine tasks</li>
<li>Volunteering for infrastructure development projects as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a number of projects planned for this year, so that 3rd bullet is important!</p>
<p>If you are interested in joining the team, please join the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-infrastructure">gnome-infrastructure mailing list</a> and introduce yourself, why you want to join and any relevant skills or experience you have. It is helpful if you have been active in other GNOME teams and can have someone vouch for you. (We are talking about giving you root access to GNOME servers, after all!)</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to send me an email, email the infrastructure list or stop by the #sysadmin IRC channel on GIMPNet IRC.</p>

            <description>I followed through and canceled my DirecTV service today. My MythTV / Boxee setup has been running great the last couple of weeks and I kept DirecTV through yesterday just as a backup as I hosted a Super Bowl party.
This all started due to extremely poor customer service from DirecTV. My high-def DVR was dying in November, specifically the hard drive, as I could hear it grinding from twelve feet away over the sound of my speakers and the buffering and audio / video playback was terrible.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I followed through and canceled my <a href="http://www.directv.com">DirecTV</a> service today. My MythTV / Boxee setup has been running great the last couple of weeks and I kept DirecTV through yesterday just as a backup as I hosted a Super Bowl party.</p>
<p>This all started due to extremely poor customer service from DirecTV. My high-def DVR was dying in November, specifically the hard drive, as I could hear it grinding from twelve feet away over the sound of my speakers and the buffering and audio / video playback was terrible.</p>
<p>I had to reboot my DVR every 2-3 days, and performance would be better, then degrade. Calling DirecTV, they made me jump through a number of hoops to diagnose it which resulted in it taking almost a month and three phone calls before they agreed to replace it. Now, I don’t own this HD-DVR receiver – I lease it from DirecTV. When I first signed up for DirecTV 11 years ago you had to buy your hardware, now you just lease it from them for $5 / month.</p>
<p>They finally agreed to replace it, but they were going to charge me a $20 shipping &amp; handling fee. My wife runs a small business out of the house, and I know it doesn’t cost $20 to ship one of those, especially in bulk. To say I was livid that I had to pay to get a receiver repaired that they own is an understatement. Each time I called in, they also tried to “upgrade” me on the last receiver that I actually owned – so I’d have to pay them another lease fee. I always told I’d only upgrade if it was a DVR, not just a standard receiver, and they always declined. (I had been able to take advantage of this a couple years ago, so I know they can upgrade old receivers to a DVR).</p>
<p>I emailed <strong>and</strong> called their customer service to complain – and their response was: “Sorry, that’s our policy”.</p>
<p>So now they’ve lost a customer. I may have had their lowest tier of service, but I also bought the March Madness and NFL Sunday Ticket packages each year, so from a revenue per customer standpoint I was above average.</p>
<p>When I called to cancel, they offered me $20 per month off for the next twelve months and a free DVR upgrade. Too little, too late. When they asked why I was cancelling, I said poor customer service for my HD-DVR experience this past November. So the customer service rep processed my cancellation, and then let me know I’d be receiving a box with pre-paid shipping to send my HD-DVR back to them. Where exactly was this pre-paid box when I needed to get it repaired? (The state of <a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/pressrelease.aspx?id=24860">Washington is suing DirecTV over hidden fees</a>).</p>
<p>What gets me is the focus DirecTV, cable companies and cell phone companies have on customer acquisition rather than keeping existing customers happy. Even though I had already contacted them and complained they weren’t willing to do anything about it until I actually cancelled. In my opinion, they need to keep a balance between these two groups of customers. This wasn’t the first customer service incident I’ve had with them over the years, but enough was enough. Thanks to innovations like <a href="http://www.boxee.tv">Boxee</a> I can make up some (but not all) of the content I’ll be missing from going over-the-air only. A loyal customer will pay dividends – do you think I’ll be recommending DirecTV to friends in the future?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://multiplayblog.com/2010/01/27/us-pay-television-angsthellipor-was-that-ennui-.aspx">Mutliplayblog today published the results of a survey</a> measuring customer satisfaction levels in satellite, cable and telco TV subscriptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Low Perceived “Value for Money” among all Digital Pay TV customers</p>
<p>Virtually across the board—and irrespective of platform—respondents reported low satisfaction in the metric of `Value for Money.’ There was very little measurable difference by platform among respondents, and in all cases, fewer than 22% of respondents felt the service “exceeded” or “greatly exceeded” expectations of value for money.</p>
<p>This is among the most important findings of study, as it underlines the vulnerability of pay television in its current state. Indeed, in a report published in 2008, we found that over 50% of US digital pay television customers would be willing to scale back or completely drop their television service if household budgetary circumstances dictated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend reading the rest of the blog post, as these companies are at a tipping point. We’ve seen it in the music industry, the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/02/08/sony-pictures-layoff.html">video industry is feeling it</a>, and now pay TV services will be feeling the pressure as technological innovations will put their business models at risk. Will they embrace their customers and these new technologies or will they become extinct? First they need to look in the mirror and see if they’re keeping their existing customers happy before trying to sign up more.

            <description>A few weeks ago I blogged about buying the hardware to set up a MythTV PC to record off air high def TV and integrate it with Boxee.
The hardware arrived and I’ve been working on on the setup off and on over the last few weeks. Some random thoughts:
  The HD Homerun tuner is pretty cool. Fedora has the HD Homerun configuration tool in their repos. Installing that through PackageKit and yum made it easy to test out that it was working and had a good signal.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=1269">I blogged about buying the hardware</a> to set up a MythTV PC to record off air high def TV and integrate it with <a href="http://www.boxee.tv">Boxee</a>.</p>
<p>The hardware arrived and I’ve been working on on the setup off and on over the last few weeks. Some random thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun_atsc">HD Homerun tuner</a> is pretty cool. Fedora has the HD Homerun configuration tool in their repos. Installing that through PackageKit and yum made it easy to test out that it was working and had a good signal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had to install <a href="http://www.mythtv.org">MyTV</a> 3 times before I could get it to work. On a vanilla <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora 12</a> install and then adding MythTV from the repos, only one tuner of the HD Homerun would work. Trying <a href="http://mythdora.com/">Mythdora</a>, my MythTV front ends on my desktop PC and my laptop wouldn’t connect. Also there was a nasty bug in Mythdora’s kernel that wouldn’t let me mount a NFS share. Using <a href="http://www.mythbuntu.org/">Mythbuntu</a> everything just worked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.schedulesdirect.org/">Schedules Direct</a> is a pretty cool service. I remember hearing about the story a couple years ago when it all went down, but when Zap2It started charging users for the scheduling data, a group of MythTV users started Schedules Direct and licensed the data. $20 / year is more than reasonable to pay to get all the scheduling data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love the fact that I can browse to the IP address of the MythTV PC from any computer and see the scheduling data and record a show. It took a few minutes to find the setting to only record new episodes, but it’s there!
Obligatory screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4300849661/" title="mythtv-schedule by silwenae, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li>The first recordings I made were the second night of the 24 season premiere and an episode of How I Met Your Mother. A one hour recording is about 6 GB.</li>
<li>I only have a 100GB hard drive in the MythTV backend, so I mounted my NAS via NFS . I would then in Boxee use the File Browser and surf to my tv recording directory. One downside to this method is that MythTV records the file, such as last week’s 24 as 1091_2010011819000mpg. The File Browser also displays a PNG file so it’s easy to tell what show is what, but it’s not intuitive at all.</li>
<li>There are plugins for XBMC, such as <a href="http://xbmc.org/wiki/?title=MythSExx">MythSExx</a> and <a href="http://xbmc.org/forum/showthread.php?t=65769">MythicalLibrarian</a> that will rename your TV recordings into a S01E01 format and create a symlink for you to make it easier to browse your recordings. I couldn’t get the former script to run, but I didn’t spend a lot of time troubleshooting either.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>And then yesterday while idling in #boxee on Freenode IRC, user SpaceBass mentioned that MythTV support was working for him in the Boxee Beta. There are a number of threads in the Boxee forums that the <a href="http://forum.boxee.tv/showthread.php?t=8663">“mythtv://” protocol doesn’t work</a> – but it appears to be working now.</p>
<p>In the Boxee settings, add a manual souce, and make it: myth://IPADDRESS where IPADDRESS is the IP address of your Myth backend and give the source a name – I used “DVR”.</p>
<p>Now use the File Browser in Boxee and when you first choose it you’ll have a list of your sources:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4300673861/" title="IMG_4870.JPG by silwenae, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Select DVR and you’ll be presented with “All Recordings”, “Guide”, “Live Channels”, “Movies” and “TV Shows”:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4300674439/" title="IMG_4871.JPG by silwenae, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Note: Guide doesn’t work for me.</p>
<p>If you choose “All Recordings” you’ll see everything that MythTV has recorded:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4301421426/" title="IMG_4872.JPG by silwenae, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>(TV Shows and Movies will just show the MythTV recordings based on those filters). I haven’t looked into using MythTV’s built-in commercial skip as Boxee has a 30 second skip that just works too. I also like that Boxee remembers to resume where I left off watching if I stop playback.</p>
<p>To watch Live TV streaming from your Myth backend to Boxee, choose Live TV from the menu I mentioned above. You’ll be presented with a list of TV channels by station ID, not number:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4300675473/" title="IMG_4873.JPG by silwenae, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>And here’s a screenshot of the NHL game on NBC in HD earlier this afternoon:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/4301422304/" title="IMG_4874.JPG by silwenae, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>There are two bugs I’m experiencing that I need to spend some time with:</p>
<ul>
<li>When playing back a recording or starting a live TV stream, it will sometimes start as if it’s being fast-forwarded, including the audio. Hitting pause and then unpausing fixes it.</li>
<li>I think this may be related to signal strength as I’m seeing it on NBC and CBS, but not Fox, but I’m seeing jagged edges around an object, such as a person, when it’s moving quickly. If it’s a fairly static image, there are no jagged edges. But even someone quickly sitting down will have the distortion. But I don’t see this problem when accessing the recording from a Myth frontend on another computer, so it needs more investigating.</li>
<li>My other theory is it could have something to do with saving the content on the NAS and not on a hard drive in the Myth backend, so I bought a larger hard drive to throw in there too. I’d also rather have it on a hard drive than the NAS just to save wear and tear.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m almost done – if I had to guess, I’m about a week away from telling DirecTV to pound sand. I’ll poke at the distortion issue some more and install that hard drive when it arrives but this has been a pretty cool project to work on so far.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <description>A few different things going on:
 Tomboy documentation is almost done in Mallard. I’ve really enjoyed using the Mallard syntax – so much less complex than Docbook. Every time I have to look up an element reference, I shake my head and think, “Duh! That makes so much more sense I should have figured that out!“. Nice work Shaun. I triaged some docs bugs in GNOME Bugzilla. Want to get involved with the GNOME Documentation team but don’t know where to start?</description>

            <description>Martin Pitt mentions in his latest blog post that it took only 4 hours to get a GNOME git account after requesting it.
And that’s all do to the work of one person: Andrea Veri.
I’ve done some poking around on the status of the Accounts Team and whether it’s active or not, but after Jeff Schroeder on the Sysadmin team sponsored Andrea last month, Andrea joined to help out specifically with GNOME Accounts and has done an awesome job.</description>

            <description>Friday I wrote a blog post kicking off a wiki page on debunking GNOME 3 myths. The dozen or so comments left on that blog post highlight perfectly why we need a wiki page that debunks myths – and it’s a good place to start to add to the wiki page. (And refine it, I think some of the comments are valid).
If you’re a GNOME developer, please give the GNOME 3 Myths page a look over and add any questions that you have been asked.</description>

            <description>I’m an entertainment junkie. I own hundreds of music CD’s, books, movies and am an early adopter of Blu-Ray. My usual routine once my two youngest children are in bed at 8 pm is to plop down on my couch, put my notebook on my lap and use that while watching my pretty 60″ TV.
I’ve received my TV content from DirecTV for the last ten years since we built this house – primarily because I’m a huge (American) football fan, and my team, the Green Bay Packers, are out of market where I live and DirecTV has a monopoly on the NFL package to be able to watch my team.</description>

My usual routine once my two youngest children are in bed at 8 pm is to plop down on my couch, put my notebook on my lap and use that while watching my pretty 60″ TV.</p>
<p>I’ve received my TV content from <a href="http://www.directv.com">DirecTV</a> for the last ten years since we built this house – primarily because I’m a huge (American) football fan, and my team, the Green Bay Packers, are out of market where I live and <a href="https://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/content/sports/nfl">DirecTV has a monopoly on the NFL package to be able to watch my team</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been happy with the television service (<a href="http://hd.engadget.com/2006/09/20/directv-gets-whats-comin-to-them/">even though it’s the most compressed of all high-def signals</a>) but their customer service is atrocious. About once a year I have a run-in with them that gets my blood boiling, but the other 364 days of the year I don’t have to think about them – it just works.</p>
<p>Almost a year ago I got a great deal on a Mac Mini and bought it to try out <a href="http://www.boxee.tv">Boxee</a>. I’ve ripped my music and movie collection to my <a href="http://www.synology.com/enu/support/releaseNote/CS407.php">NAS</a> and Boxee gave me the ability to stream that straight to my TV plus their collection of Internet content I could stream as well, such as The Daily Show, Hulu and more. My best friend uses <a href="http://www.plexapp.com/">Plex</a>, and both Plex &amp; Boxee are based on the <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> upstream code which does an awesome job of playing back any file you throw at it.</p>
<p>I’ve loved Boxee – the user experience has only gotten better from the Alpha to the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5442995/first-look-at-the-boxee-beta?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+lifehacker/full+(Lifehacker)">Beta that launched today</a> (the screenshots don’t do it justice). I’ve thought about, but never very seriously, getting rid of DirecTV and going Internet only. With Netflix streaming (both in Boxee and on my Xbox 360), Hulu and other apps available in Boxee, there’s a lot of content I can get if I’m willing to be patient for DVD releases of my favorite shows that I can’t watch in real time.</p>
<p>And then in early November, my DirecTV high-def DVR started to die. And it was a painful experience having to call in to their tech support once a week, rebooting my box every few days until they finally agreed to swap it out a month later (I pay $5 / month to lease the box from them – I don’t even own it!) I was pretty frustrated with the entire process, and this is a long enough story as it is, so I won’t go in to all the details, but when I received my bill in early December and found out they charged me $20 to replace the box, I was livid. They never bothered to inform me of the charge or asked for permission in charging me, and you may think “It’s only $20!” – but when I called to ask them to refund it, they refused – so I asked them to refund my $100 monthly charge for November as my box didn’t work and I didn’t feel that I received the service I paid for and they still refused, I started to think about all these options.</p>
<p>After a long conversation with my wife on the advantages and disadvantages of not having cable or satellite (she doesn’t watch TV anyway) I’ve decided to cut the cord. I’m lucky enough to have a nice HDTV antenna on my roof right next to the satellite dish and all the coax terminates at one spot in the basement, so re-wiring won’t be tough.</p>
<p>We spend just under a $100 month on DirecTV (cheapest package, 3 boxes for 3 TVs, DVR service and HD service). I figure with a small investment in buying some new hardware it will pay itself back in 3 months (considering I had already bought the Mac Mini a year ago):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun_atsc">HD Homerun</a>: Dual tuner off-air HD tuner with a network jack that any PC in the house can connect to for watching or recording live TV: $150</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EKCGT8/ref=oss_T15_product">HD amplifier &amp; terminators</a>: $35</li>
<li>Digital converter boxes for the other 2 TVs in the house to get off-air: $20 each off Ebay</li>
<li><a href="http://www.elgato.com/">Elgato EyeTV PVR software</a> for Mac: $80 (maybe, see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>The one kink in my plan is I realized that if I buy the EyeTV to record TV on to the Mac Mini it can only record one show at a time, even though I have a dual-tuner HD Homerun. There are a few shows like NBC Thursday night comedies and Fringe on Fox that I like that air at the same time, so that’s a challenge. One of the major reasons I bought the HD Homerun is the fact that’s dual tuner but also that it has a network jack and works on Linux. One option is to install <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> on an older computer and use that. MythTV has native support for the HD Homerun and I can mount my NAS via NFS and just point Boxee at it, though there are some questions whether <a href="http://forum.boxee.tv/showthread.php?t=8663">Boxee and XBMC can read the .nuv</a> files that MythTV records in.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty cool time seeing these convergence devices come to life. The Internet is evolving to add video content, whether it’s TV shows like Hulu or movies &amp; DVD on Netflix. CES is happening this week and seeing the <a href="http://blog.boxee.tv/2010/01/07/boxee-box-internals-revealed-nvidia-tegra-2-ftw/">Boxee Box</a>, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5439293/syabas-popbox-get-ready-for-the-new-media-streamer-champ">Popbox</a> and <a href="http://ces.cnet.com/8301-31045_1-10427068-269.html?tag=fbshare">Iomega</a> set top boxes only support this point. There are still some challenges – I’m going to have to give up watching my favorite football team, live sports on ESPN, and waiting to watch some of my TV shows until they release on DVD, but I think it’s worth trying.</p>
<p>The content companies are going to have to evolve. They’re going to need better customer service and better ways to allow consumers access to content. (And I’m <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20100106/1804437638.shtml">willing to put up with the movie studios stupid rental window on Netflix</a> if it means more streaming content). My hardware arrived today and now I’m off to start installing all this stuff….</p>

            <description>I’ve been wanting an eReader for a while. When the Kindle first launched, I was in awe. I quickly sat down and calculated the number of books I buy in a year and compared that against the cost of a Kindle and the savings of buying an e-book for $10 vs. the hardcover price. Let’s just say there wasn’t much of a savings. I finally got to touch a Kindle at GUADEC this summer, and my mind was made up that I had to have an eReader in the near future.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been wanting an eReader for a while. When the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Generation/dp/B0015T963C/ref=amb_link_86172951_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-1&amp;pf_rd_r=0CPKEQT0G6NS5609RMGN&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=503619171&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">Kindle</a> first launched, I was in awe. I quickly sat down and calculated the number of books I buy in a year and compared that against the cost of a Kindle and the savings of buying an e-book for $10 vs. the hardcover price. Let’s just say there wasn’t much of a savings. I finally got to touch a Kindle at GUADEC this summer, and my mind was made up that I had to have an eReader in the near future.</p>
<p>I love tech gadgets and am an early adopter. I also love content and media, and own hundreds (if not over a thousand now) music CDs, hundreds of movies (including Blu-Ray that I bought over 2 years ago), and tons of books. My bookshelves are full to bursting in my office, and I have boxes of books stored in my closet without room to display them.</p>
<p>I’ve waited patiently debating an eReader. I travel once or twice a month for work, and having an eReader would definitely save space. This week, my flight was delayed hours on Tuesday, and then canceled later that night. I had finished the book I had brought an hour after getting to the airport, and then bought another one swearing in my head the whole how I wished I had a an eReader.</p>
<p>The good news is that when Barnes &amp; Noble announced the <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/">nook</a> last month that I pre-ordered one. As much as I love Amazon (I buy almost everything there now – movies, music, books and electronics) I found the nook more aesthetically pleasing as well as it was running Android, and the formats they’re using seem a bit more open than the Kindle. (My nook is supposed to ship tomorrow, still crossing my fingers with all the delays they’ve had for the last week or two!)</p>
<p>But now comes word that the publishing industry doesn’t get it and is fears change and the changing financial models. It’s <a href="http://www.tbiresearch.com/e-readers-should-drive-profits-for-both-distributors-and-book-publishers-2009-11">rumored that Amazon loses $2 per eBook</a> bought, and now we are hearing the publishers want to <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/ebooknewser/publishers/harpercollins_jumps_on_ebook_delaying_bandwagon__145582.asp?c=rss">delay</a> <a href="http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/78872272.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUUsZ">new releases</a> 4 months after the hardcover comes out but before the paperback comes out. When will content companies figure out that not giving consumers what they want is bad for business?</p>
<p>There are authors (Iain Banks, Chuck Palahniuk, Neal Stephenson, Neil Gaiman) that I will always buy the physical copy. I want to continue to build on my collections and there is a tactile difference in having a physical book. But I will buy many more books once I have my nook. I’ve already been adding to wishlist on bn.com for the moment my nook arrives. I have dozens of posts tagged “books” in my RSS reader that I want to buy. The fact that they’re slightly cheaper as an eBook and no shipping is nice, but having immediate wireless delivery right to my eReader is even better.</p>
<p>So the publishers are worried that Amazon (and to a lesser degree Barnes &amp; Noble) have set a pricing ceiling of $9.99 per book. We’ve been through this argument before – the record industries felt Apple had set a similar ceiling that songs were only worth $0.99 and now we’ve seen new releases and popular tracks increase to $1.29 this year. And that’s ok. I worked in the retail industry for 15 years and have been through anti-trust training a couple of times. The publishers can set their price and the retailer can sell it for whatever they want.</p>
<p>If the publishers are so worried, why are they not raising the cost of the books? If Amazon is losing $2 per book, that means the cost to Amazon is $12. If the publishers raise it to $15, it will make the retailers re-consider whether losing more money is acceptable. While the publisher can’t dictate the actual retail price sold, they do have options. And lowering the cost after it’s been released a while happens all the time across all retail categories. There is no reason that months after the release the cost comes down and the retailer can re-price, at say, $9.99. This is seen all the time in the movie space, though rarely in music. Now that we are starting to have competition in the eReader space there are all kinds of tricks the publishers can do to partner with the retailer to save the retailer money on the back end as well, including marketing development funds, sell through credits and more.</p>
<p>But for the publishers to flatly state “<a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/ebooknewser/publishers/harpercollins_jumps_on_ebook_delaying_bandwagon__145582.asp?c=rss">We won’t release an eBook for 4 months</a>” won’t make consumers happy. Nor, in my opinion, will it make consumers buy a hardcover once they’ve invested $200-$400 in an eReader. I’ve learned this lesson – I rarely buy a movie on new release day for $20-$30 when I subscribe to Netflix and know if I wait 3-6 months I can probably get it for $10-$15 on sale (I just got Watchmen on Blu-Ray for $10 last week!).</p>
<p>At this point, it’s difficult to read the future. These statements from the publishers could just be posturing as they dig in for negotiation with the retailers. But I’m not hopeful. There are plenty of lessons for content providers to learn from in the music battles of the last 10 years. And if there is one lesson they should employ, it’s to extend and embrace the new models rather than try to prop up a dying business model. Change is hard – and if consumers want to buy more books because they have an eReader, it’s in the publisher’s best interest to figure out how to do that, rather than making it harder for consumers to buy from them.</p>

            <description>I’ve been working on Banshee documentation on and off for the last few months (ok, more off than on) but as I get more comfortable writing in Mallard and the recent discussion in getting Banshee on the GNOME release cycle I am motivated to get this to done.
The most important part of writing documentation (or writing in general) is the planning phase. A few of us on the Docs team did a first pass at planning the topics that should be in the user help of Banshee in Google Wave, and I’ve copied that over to the GNOME wiki.</description>

<p>The most important part of writing documentation (or writing in general) is the planning phase. A few of us on the Docs team did a first pass at planning the topics that should be in the user help of Banshee in Google Wave, and I’ve <a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Planning/BansheePlanning">copied that over to the GNOME wiki</a>.</p>
<p>If you use Banshee, please <a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Planning/BansheePlanning">give it a look</a> – are there any topics missing that you think a user would want help with? Writing user help in Mallard gives us the ability to organize topics into groups – for a good example, <a href="http://library.gnome.org/users/empathy/stable/">check out the Empathy help</a>. What’s missing? What would you organize differently?</p>
<p>Do you want to help? Have you written about Banshee features before? Let me know – either add content to the wiki page or post a link as a comment on my blog. If you have written a howto for Banshee, we’d love to include it – the new GNOME help is CC 3.0 licensed, so it’s easy to add from other sources, as long as it’s licensed as CC-SA 3.0. Please don’t feel you have to know how to write documentation or use Mallard – you can create a sub-page on the wiki for the topic and I will be more than happy to help edit it, convert it to Mallard and commit to git. Right now the important thing is to make sure we have the topics right and get some first drafts of the actual help created. I appreciate all help and would rather not do it all myself if at all possible!</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://gitorious.org/~pcutler/banshee/docs">Banshee Docs branch on Gitorious</a> – if you do know Mallard and want to help let me know and I’ll get you added to the team. If you don’t know Mallard, let’s start <a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Planning/BansheePlanning">writing some howto’s in the wiki</a>!</p>

            <description>I’m two days late blogging about the latest release of GNOME Journal (and thanks to Danni for mentioning it!).
This is a very special issue written by women in the open source community. It’s the first time we’ve done a themed issue and all articles are by women in the open source community. Also, with the exception of Danni and Stormy who have written for GNOME Journal before, all are first time writers for GJ!</description>

<p>This is a very special issue written by women in the open source community. It’s the first time we’ve done a themed issue and all articles are by women in the open source community. Also, with the exception of Danni and Stormy who have written for GNOME Journal before, all are first time writers for GJ!</p>
<p>Women in open source (and the IT industry in general) is a topic I’m passionate about, having seen it first hand in a few different ways. My wife worked in the IT industry (at the same employer I did) for 8 years and I also helped manage the Geek Squad at Best Buy for a number of years before leaving 2 years ago. Having over 10,000 computer technicians there was definitely a lack of diversity and talent, including women, which is / was a focus area for the organization.</p>
<p>I’m proud to have helped manage the release (though it was a bit later than I had hoped due to my lack of time management skills). The idea for this issue came from the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen">GNOME Women community</a>, and they found the writers and drove this issue. Thank you!</p>
<p>We have eight articles in this issue (a record!):</p>
<ul>
<li>Telepathy, Empathy and Mission Control 5 in GNOME 2.28</li>
<li>Telepathy Overview</li>
<li>The Un-Scary Screwdriver</li>
<li>Where are they now? The Participants of the 2006 Women’s Summer Outreach Program</li>
<li>Easy Breezy Beautiful GNOME Shell</li>
<li>GNOME desktop testing automation and how to use Mago</li>
<li>Epiphany from a – not so experienced – user perspective</li>
<li>An Interview with Leslie Hawthorn</li>
</ul>
<p>We also had a number of new editors help out, and I’d like to personally thank <a href="http://www.dissociatedpress.net/">Zonker</a> and <a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/ces.shtml">Sumana</a> for all their help in making this release happen.</p>

            <description>Almost two months ago, Nigel Tao posted on his blog offering Google Wave invites to the GNOME community. I commented and requested some invites for the Documentation Team, with Nigel graciously granting the request, and he asked for some feedback after using Wave for the last month and a half or so.
Some of the feedback that I shared with him, in no particular order:

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost two months ago, <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/nigeltao/2009/09/30/jump-in-the-waters-fine/">Nigel Tao posted on his blog offering Google Wave invites to the GNOME community</a>. I commented and requested some invites for the Documentation Team, with Nigel graciously granting the request, and he asked for some feedback after using Wave for the last month and a half or so.</p>
<p>Some of the feedback that I shared with him, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>We in the Docs team have used Wave to do document planning. (Before writing anything, the most important thing you can do is plan, plan plan). Wave has been really useful that each member of the team will edit the Wave with the topics for the help file we plan to write, and then use the reply feature in the Wave to add comments. Especially being a distributed team, with two of us in the US and 2 in Europe, it’s been helpful. A wiki page would work about the same, but the fact that you can have the main Wave used for the document and see the feedback and comments in-line is nice.</li>
<li>We really haven’t used Wave for real-time collaboration, with the exception of doing last month’s meeting minutes for our monthly team meeting. I do like Wave for a use case like that better than Gobby, especially with Wave’s ability to add bullets and formatting.</li>
<li>One nice thing about Wave when doing documentation planning was how easy it was to add the lead developer of an app we were doing the planning for. He was then able to review what we were planning, and add feedback and suggestions.</li>
<li>One of the challenges in using Wave at this point in time, is the limited number of people using it. I think as it expands and grows, the use cases and adoption will grow exponentially.</li>
<li>Other things I’ve used Wave for include some of the GNOME Marketing hackfest planning and projectmallard.org planning. It’s helpful, and as mentioned above, I prefer Wave over a wiki, especially when formatting text such as bullets.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that took me a while to figure out, which I finally figured out with a suggestion from a friend via Twitter, was how to do public searches. I’m interested in buying a Droid phone, and I did a search for “Droid” waves which was pretty cool when the search results came back and I could see all the public Waves about Droid.</p>
<p>Is Wave an email killer? In my opinion, not yet, but it has potential. Wave, to me, has awesome potential for group communication, but I’m not sure I’d use it over email for one to one communication.</p>
<p>(And yes, I’m aware of the irony of using a “proprietary” tool to do open source work. It was a test, and I like doing stuff on the cutting edge, so no comments in the blog about this please).</p>
<p>Thanks again Nigel!</p>

            <description>I’m overdue in recapping some of my thoughts of the Marketing Hackfest. Overall, the hackfest was a success and now we begin the hard work in recapping everything we talked about, making it actionable and doing the work!
One of the best things about the hackfest, in my opinion, was the cross-section of people who attended. Each individual had different strengths and views of GNOME and it served to remind me of the different groups who use GNOME and how they use it.</description>

<p>One of the best things about the hackfest, in my opinion, was the cross-section of people who attended. Each individual had different strengths and views of GNOME and it served to remind me of the different groups who use GNOME and how they use it.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time at the whiteboard helping facilitate and I’m still sorting through all the notes we discussed. Somewhere Shaun has some video as well.</p>
<p>A lot of our discussion was centered on GNOME 3.0 and how we can communicate to our users and our downstream partners of the features and benefits of GNOME 3.0. If you think back to the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2009-April/msg00004.html">email Vincent Untz sent this past April on behalf of the Release Team</a>, GNOME 3.0 has three goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revamp our User Experience</li>
<li>Streamlining of the Platform</li>
<li>Promotion of GNOME</li>
</ul>
<p>That third goal is why we got together and the bulk of what we discussed. We touched on what GNOME 3.0 is; GNOME’s overall branding; marketing GNOME to users and how to improve our partnerships with downstream distributions such as Fedora, OpenSolaris, openSUSE and Ubuntu.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t all just discussion ’round the campfire! We did a lot of work on creating materials for volunteers who host a GNOME booth at a conference. We wrote the copy for a new brochure explaining what GNOME is; created a Frequently Asked Questions for those hosting a booth with answers to questions they should expect from conference attendees; and wrote core messages and speaking points when talking to attendees.</p>
<p>We also discussed in detail the Friends of GNOME program and did some work on an upcoming fundraising drive.</p>
<p>And lastly we’ve started to work on presentation materials for volunteers who may want to give a presentation on GNOME. We still have a ways to go to finish this work, but using the awesome template Vinicius created, we envision having a number of presentations available that can be used as building blocks for someone who wants to give a presentation on GNOME. Some of these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNOME History (5 minutes)</li>
<li>GNOME 3.0 (5 minutes)</li>
<li>Getting started using GNOME (5 minutes)</li>
<li>Getting started developing GNOME (5 minutes)</li>
<li>GNOME 3.0 (45 minutes)</li>
</ul>
<p>And lots of others – the above are just examples of templates with content someone could take and mix and match together to put together the bulk of a presentation they might want to give.</p>
<p>Lastly, we also spent some time talking about the GNOME Marketing community and how we can work together, communicate effectively, mentor new members and tackle some of our action items. We’ll start by having IRC Meetings where we can recap some of the discussion topics from the hackfest, discuss ideas from the community on improving how we market GNOME and hopefully have some of the community members volunteer to tackle some of the action items and next steps in creating marketing materials for GNOME. Look for the announcement in the next couple of days to help pick a time for that meeting, and similar to the Bug Squad, we’ll use Doodle.com to try and find a time that works for as many people as possible.</p>
<p>More to come!</p>

            <description>We are just days away from the Marketing Hackfest in Chicago, IL. Thanks to Novell and Google’s sponsorship, nine of us are converging in Google’s Chicago office for two days.
While we’re there, we’d like to invite any Chicago GNOME users and developers to join us for a drink or bite to eat Tuesday night at 6:30 p.m. at the Rock Bottom Brewery at One West Grand Ave.
I look forward to seeing you there!</description>

            <description>Did anyone watch The Office last Thursday night? Early in the episode, Dwight gives Jim a wood duck with a walkie-talkie built-in so Dwight can spy on Jim.
 Jim: Thanks for the duck
Dwight: It’s not a duck, it’s a mallard!
 This had me chuckling thinking about Mallard documentation. For the record, mallards are a much more beautiful duck than wood ducks.
There’s been a lot going on in the world of GNOME documentation.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Did anyone watch The Office last Thursday night? Early in the episode, Dwight gives Jim a wood duck with a walkie-talkie built-in so Dwight can spy on Jim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jim</em>: Thanks for the duck</p>
<p><em>Dwight</em>: It’s not a duck, it’s a mallard!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This had me chuckling thinking about Mallard documentation. For the record, mallards are a much more beautiful duck than wood ducks.</p>
<p>There’s been a lot going on in the world of GNOME documentation. Mallard has been getting a lot of buzz, in the #docs IRC channel, on Twitter and identi.ca, the mailing list and blogs. People have taken notice of the new Empathy documentation with its new layout and focus on topic based documentation.</p>
<p>Here’s just a few of the things going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve expanded our monthly <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/docs">GNOME Docs meetings</a>, and we’re practically meeting every other week now. We’ll be having a working session in our next meeting November 8th focused on what a new GNOME User Guide (Shaun hates calling it a User Guide!) will look like for GNOME 3.0. Shaun came back from the Boston Summit with lots of ideas and discussions around user help and the work we’ll need to do for GNOME 3.0.</li>
<li>Milo Casagrande, author of the new Empathy help, recently <a href="http://milocasagrande.wordpress.com/2009/10/25/long-time-but-mallard-alive/">blogged about his experience</a> in writing the Empathy help. He includes the process he went through, writing per page topics and also includes code samples. If you’re looking into getting involved in writing GNOME documentation, his blog is a must read.</li>
<li>For the GNOME 2.29 cycle, I’m committed to writing new <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/">Tomboy</a> help in Mallard as well as adding help to <a href="http://www.banshee-project.org">Banshee</a> for the first time. I’m starting with Tomboy as its help is a bit more basic than Banshee which has more advanced features. I’ve created a <a href="http://git.gnome.org/cgit/tomboy/log/?h=docs">docs branch in Tomboy’s GNOME git</a> and have been adding pages over the last week or two to get up to speed on Mallard. I have to say, writing docs in Mallard is ten times easier than Docbook. The XML markup just makes sense and is so much simpler than Docbook.</li>
<li>For Banshee, I have a <a href="http://www.gitorious.org/~pcutler/banshee/docs">git branch on Gitorious</a>. I’ve checked out the code again after not working on it for a couple of months and have started working on it.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/nigeltao/2009/09/30/jump-in-the-waters-fine/">Nigel</a> hooked some members of the Docs team up with Google Wave invites. It’s been interesting trying out Wave for collaboration for Docs writing. Not so much writing the actual documentation, but it’s been helpful for planning the pages, which is the most important part of any writing. With us half a world apart we haven’t really had a chance to use Wave for real time collaboration which I think it’s more suited for, but it’s been helpful. At this point a wiki would probably work just as well, but I do like the threaded view which makes it easier to see when changes or updates were made in Wave.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/shaunm">Shaun</a> is off working feverishly on a new <a href="http://git.gnome.org/cgit/yelp/log/?h=yelp-3-0">Yelp help browser for GNOME 3.0</a>. Details are scarce at this point, but he seems excited.</li>
<li>We’ve also launched <a href="http://www.projectmallard.org">ProjectMallard.org</a>. It’s our goal that the Mallard XML schema is used in more than just GNOME. It’s early in Mallard’s development so no big announcements, but it’s helpful to think about user help in FOSS on a greater scale. The webpage is just a place holder at this point, but we have plans to add information on what Mallard is, how to get started including code samples, tools, specifications, extensions and more.</li>
<li>We’re planning on having a GNOME Docs meetup in Chicago on November 9th prior to the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeMarketing/MarketingHackfest2009">marketing hackfest</a>. <a href="http://j1m.net/">Jim Campbell</a> from XFCE might stop by but unfortunately <a href="http://blog.nixternal.com">Nixternal</a> of KDE fame will be out of town.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now is a great time to get involved with GNOME Documentation. Stop by on IRC in #docs on GimpNET or <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-doc-list">join the mailing list</a>, we’d love to share what is going on with Mallard and how we are planning to make user help a better experience.</p>

            <description>Three weeks from today members of the GNOME Marketing team will converge on Chicago for two days of work, brainstorming and fun.
With thanks to Google for hosting us and Novell for sponsoring us, we’ll set aside two days to work on:
 GNOME Presentation materials. We want to make it easy for for volunteers to represent GNOME at conferences, including presentations, booth materials such as banners and brochures for the GNOME Event Box and more.</description>

            <description>I’ve been feeling a bit down about GNOME Journal since our last planned issue for October fell apart at the last minute. There were a number of reasons and nobody’s fault but after the great success we’ve seen this year in having multiple issues published after not having published in 2008 I was afraid we were losing momentum again. (I’m very excited about our next issue, Women in GNOME, but was concerned about issues after that).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been feeling a bit down about <a href="http://www.gnomejournal.org">GNOME Journal</a> since our last planned issue for October fell apart at the last minute. There were a number of reasons and nobody’s fault but after the great success we’ve seen this year in having multiple issues published after not having published in 2008 I was afraid we were losing momentum again. (I’m very excited about our next issue, Women in GNOME, but was concerned about issues after that).</p>
<p>I am glad to have been proven wrong, and in the process, re-energized about GNOME Journal.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to have lunch with <a href="http://www.stormyscorner.com/">Stormy</a> earlier this week and mentioned to her that one of our authors, after seeing his article just not be ready, ask if there were any other articles he could write. After reviewing our article brainstorming list, I was stumped for ideas to give him as a number of the ideas were out of date. Having mentioned this to Stormy, she quickly added about a dozen ideas later in the week!</p>
<p>Then, out of the blue yesterday, <a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/sumana">Sumana</a> jumped in and helped to update and re-organize our wiki pages and sent an email to the list mentioning the updates and some ideas for future issues.</p>
<p>After sending out my normal request for updates on the upcoming issue, two new volunteers sent emails within minutes of my email offering to help as well.</p>
<p>This is what I love about the GNOME community!</p>
<p>Now is a great time to get involved with GNOME Journal and here are a few different ideas on how to participate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have an idea for an article you’d like to see? <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeJournal/ArticleWishlist">Add it here</a>.</li>
<li>Want to write an article? Need an idea? <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeJournal/ArticleWishlist">See the same list</a>. And if you’re not comfortable writing an article by yourself, collaboration is always encouraged! Send an email to the list and I know a number of writers, including myself, would be more than happy to co-write an article.</li>
<li>Help edit an article for a writer. Review the article structure, review spelling and grammar and if possible add the needed markup for our CMS.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m still hopeful we’ll move from our current CMS (Textpattern) to WordPress-MU on blogs.gnome.org later this year. (Jeff Waugh – still need your help if you’re available!) Once that migration starts to occur we’ll also be looking for help and ideas around what WordPress plugins could enhance the GNOME Journal experience.</p>

            <description>Christer Edwards (aka Zelut) recently represented GNOME at the Utah Open Source Conference. He’s got some great pictures up and has some good things to say about GNOME, including that he’s getting involved more (which is great to see!)
Read his full blog post (with pictures) here.
Christer and I were also recently talking about how we can expand GNOME usergroups in the US – he’s got some great ideas and experience.</description>

            <description>It’s that time of year to start thinking about the GNOME Annual report and recapping all the wonderful activities the GNOME community has been involved in over the past year.
Lucas has done an awesome job over the last few years and this year has asked me to help with coordinating the annual report.
The annual report is one of the first things I ever contributed to GNOME (as an editor) and I hope I can do as good a job as Lucas has done.</description>

            <description>(This is the first in a series of blogs posts about Ohio Linux Fest)
I gave a talk this weekend at Ohio Linux Fest titled “An Introduction to GNOME 3.0”. The purpose of my talk was, which I hope to do a few more times this year, is to start introducing the community to the changes coming in GNOME 3.0. Change is hard, especially when we’re talking about a change to the user interface, and I believe the sooner we start engaging and educating the community, the more helpful it will be.</description>

<p>I gave a talk this weekend at Ohio Linux Fest titled “An Introduction to GNOME 3.0”. The purpose of my talk was, which I hope to do a few more times this year, is to start introducing the community to the changes coming in GNOME 3.0. Change is hard, especially when we’re talking about a change to the user interface, and I believe the sooner we start engaging and educating the community, the more helpful it will be.</p>
<p>The presentation focuses on three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is GNOME</li>
<li>History of GNOME (up to and including a brief overview of GNOME 2.28)</li>
<li>GNOME 3.0</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing I hope attendees take away is that GNOME 3.0 is more than just GNOME Shell. I believe the call to action in the GNOME 3.0 community that Vincent and the release team started back in April and that continued at GUADEC really motivated a number of teams to see what they could do to contribute to GNOME 3.0. In the presentation I talk about Accessibility, Documentation, Marketing, the GNOME Developer Platform, the GNOME Activity Journal and Zeitgeist, Tomboy Online and GNOME Shell (including a demo).</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time reading <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/">Presentation Zen</a> these last few months and used the concepts the book advocates. In addition to the presentation, I also provided a handout (available as a <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/download/intrognome3.pdf">PDF on my website</a> as well) for attendees to take away that goes into a little more detail and cites and attributes all of my sources.</p>
<p>I’ve uploaded my <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeMarketing/MarketingMaterial?action=AttachFile&amp;do=view&amp;target=GNOME3presentation.tar.gz">slides, images, and the handout</a> on the GNOME Marketing wiki, all available in one archive. This material is available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Share-alike 3.0</a> license. I’m sure I’ve got a few things wrong here and there, and I look forward to any feedback anyone has.</p>
<p>I’ll be giving this talk in November in St. Paul, MN at the <a href="http://www.penguinsunbound.org/">Penguins Unbound LUG</a>, and I’m hoping to reach out to a few more LUGs in the Midwest, as well as submit it as a talk at <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/">SCALE</a> next February. If you’d like me to come give a talk somewhere, let me know via email or my blog.</p>

            <description>I’ll be in Columbus, Ohio this weekend for Ohio Linux Fest. It will be my first time attending OLF, though I did book a flight last year and had to cancel at the last minute.
I’ll be giving a talk – “An Introduction GNOME 3.0” where I’ll cover what GNOME is, how it started, touch on the recent 2.28 release, and what may be coming in GNOME 3.0. I’ll post my presentation, both the handout and the slides, next week on the GNOME Marketing wiki.</description>

            <description>GNOME 2.28 came out right on time yesterday! Improvements include Bluetooth support, tons of feature enhancements in Empathy (and all new documentation using Mallard!), and Webkit in Epiphany. But don’t take my word for it – go read the release notes!
Speaking of release notes, it was the first time I’ve helped write them, and and it was pretty cool to see the GNOME community working together from a front row seat.</description>

<p>GNOME 2.28 came out right on time yesterday! Improvements include Bluetooth support, tons of feature enhancements in Empathy (and all new documentation using Mallard!), and Webkit in Epiphany. But don’t take my word for it – go <a href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.28/">read the release notes</a>!</p>
<p>Speaking of release notes, it was the first time I’ve helped write them, and and it was pretty cool to see the GNOME community working together from a front row seat. A special thanks to Dannielle for giving me pointers on how to get started, Frederic and Andre for all my questions during the process in the #docs channel, and everyone who helped review them and gave feedback to make them better. It was also pretty neat to see the translators at work – everytime I’d refresh the website to proofread or do a git pull there were more and more translations available. And one last thank you to Bastien and Guillame for providing <a href="http://www.gnome.org/press/releases/2009-09-gnome228.html">quotes in the press release</a>, which is the first time we’ve included quotes from developers as far as I know (or at least in recent memory).</p>
<p>I’ve enjoyed reading the various coverage on the web, but I did want to correct one small point that <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=NzU1NA">some</a> <a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/Gnome-2-28-the-dawn-of-a-new-era--/features/114311">are</a> <a href="http://foo.iskandar.web.id/2009/09/news-gnome-2-28-released-gnome-3-0-is-up-next/">reporting</a> – the decision to make GNOME 2.30 into GNOME 3.0 won’t be made until November, so it’s not a safe assumption that 2.28 is the last 2.x release. The release team will consider a number of factors, and it’s possible 2.32 could be 3.0 instead.</p>
<p>Congrats again to all the GNOME developers, contributors, and translators for a job well done.</p>

            <title>Happy Birthday GNOME Journal!</title>

            <description>GNOME Journal celebrates it’s 5 year anniversary this month, with the first ever edition released in September 2004.
After taking 2008 off, I’m happy to say that 2009 is turning into a banner year for GNOME Journal, and 2009 has seen more issues published than any year other 2005, and we’re on pace to break 2005’s record of five issues.
Looking back at the first Letter from the Editor from Jim Hodapp, it’s good to see that our mission hasn’t changed:</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>GNOME Journal celebrates it’s <a href="http://gnomejournal.org/article/7/letter-from-the-editor">5 year anniversary this month</a>, with the first ever edition released in September 2004.</p>
<p>After taking 2008 off, I’m happy to say that 2009 is turning into a banner year for GNOME Journal, and 2009 has seen more issues published than any year other 2005, and we’re on pace to break 2005’s record of five issues.</p>
<p>Looking back at the <a href="http://gnomejournal.org/article/7/letter-from-the-editor">first Letter from the Editor</a> from Jim Hodapp, it’s good to see that our mission hasn’t changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>There is a current lack of original written content centered around GNOME – GNOME Journal fulfills this void by creating original content that focuses on the technology, community, philosophy, and general happenings within the GNOME umbrella.</li>
<li>A void that is largely unfilled currently is how to effectively market the GNOME desktop to people who either currently use a free operating system and don’t use GNOME, or to attract those people who use another operating system altogether GNOME will not run. GNOME Journal will provide a very tangible and centralized place that people can read to gain original insite into what GNOME is and what they can do with it.</li>
<li>Lastly, GNOME Journal is entering into existence simply because it is a cool idea. It is my hope that it will also spur on increased appreciation for GNOME and allow more people to feel like they can get involved in the community.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I whole heartedly agree with the above statements, and they are just as true in 2009 as they were in 2004. There continues to be a lack of original content around GNOME; as a member of the GNOME Marketing team there is no question that it is hard to market GNOME to our existing user base; and there is no question that GNOME Journal is, and continues to be, a cool idea.</p>
<p>One of the things I’m most proud of since becoming the release coordinator for GNOME Journal earlier this year, is the new writers who have (and will have) contributed to GNOME Journal.</p>
<p>In no particular order: Stormy Peters, Les Harris, Jayson Rowe, Og Maciel, Natan Yellin, and Emily Chen.</p>
<p>I’m also thankful to everyone in the GNOME Community who has made time for interviews on interesting projects such as J5 and Laszlo Peter, and those featured in Behind the Scenes, including Stormy, Owen Taylor and Lucas Rocha.</p>
<p>We aren’t done with 2009 either! We have two special editions coming up, the first focused on Multimedia and the second is an edition of GNOME Journal written by the GNOME Women team. We’re hoping to introduce new features in GNOME Journal, including a new article every feature, as well as migrating from our current CMS to blogs.gnome.org, which will also us to do multimedia, publish to PDF, and rate articles. And a big thank you to Dave Neary letting us know our database crashed last week and we weren’t displaying any content. <em>(Jeff Waugh – if you’re reading this, please reply to my emails so we can finish this migration. Thank you!)</em></p>
<p>We’re always looking for new article ideas, writers and editors – we’re also big on collaboration, so don’t feel that you have to write an entire article by yourself. Interested? Email me, leave a comment on my blog, or best of all, <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-journal-list">join the GNOME Journal mailing list.</a></p>
<p>And lastly, thank you to our readers. Our hits have been going up every issue, and I am grateful for all the comments left on my blog after announcing a new issue. I’m hopeful that we can turn these comments into reality, and we’re already working on a suggestion for an interview that was just recently left on my blog.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy reading GNOME Journal as much as we enjoy writing it.</p>

            <description>I’m glad this week is over.
The good:
 My dad drove up and visited for a few days, spending a day at the PGA championship, which is in my suburb outside of Minneapolis. My dad left, and my mother-in-law and sister-in-law came up to visit with my wife and the kids.  The bad:
 Alex broke his arm within a couple weeks of buying his first skateboard. The PGA Championship was in town.</description>

<li>My dad left, and my mother-in-law and sister-in-law came up to visit with my wife and the kids.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex broke his arm within a couple weeks of buying his first skateboard.</li>
<li>The PGA Championship was in town. Lots of lost people driving around, and traffic was terrible in my little suburb.</li>
<li>With the in-laws in town Friday morning, I woke up early and went to the coffee shop to do some work. Renewed a domain there, and I’m guessing via the open wifi, my credit card was stolen. Apparently I need to learn more about SSL – the good news is Chase stopped it all. Who signs up for a $2000 sports camp (for their kids?) with a stolen card. Oh, and lots of iTunes purchases – software I never have (and probably never will) use.</li>
</ul>
<p>With everything going on, I’m feeling behind with some of my work in GNOME. First up, working on the release notes for 2.28!</p>

            <description>Do you follow news.gnome.org, or subscribe to it in your feedreader? news.gnome.org is similar to Planet GNOME, but is for project’s news feeds, where Planet GNOME is for personal feeds.
Stormy posts to the Foundation blog that updates to news.gnome.org, and she just recently started cross-posting her weekly updates to Planet GNOME as well.
Late yesterday, Stormy posted an update on the Friends of GNOME program. We are very close to our $20,000 goal!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you follow <a href="http://news.gnome.org/">news.gnome.org</a>, or subscribe to it in your feedreader? <a href="http://news.gnome.org/">news.gnome.org</a> is similar to <a href="http://planet.gnome.org">Planet GNOME</a>, but is for project’s news feeds, where Planet GNOME is for personal feeds.</p>

<p>Late yesterday, <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/foundation/2009/07/21/friends-of-gnome-update-3/">Stormy posted an update</a> on the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/friends/">Friends of GNOME</a> program. We are very close to our $20,000 goal! Thank you to everyone who has donated in 2009!</p>
<p>If you look at our three month trend:</p>
<ul>
<li>April: 110 donors, $3,316 donations for an average of $30</li>
<li>May: 258 donors, $7,341 donations for an average of $28</li>
<li>June: 116 donors, $1,585 donations for an average of $14</li>
</ul>
<p>In May and June, 100 of those donors were Friends of GNOME donors donating $10 month. This highlights why monthly donors are so important – one time donors come and go, and with the call for help that was put out, you can see the effect. But when that ends, it’s the monthly donors that help with consistent donations that give GNOME the ability to forecast incoming revenue that can be used to help the organization.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/foundation/2009/07/21/friends-of-gnome-update-3/">Stormy’s post</a> contains more information on donations as well as some graphs showing monthly and yearly trends.</p>
<p>Can you help GNOME with $10 a month? For the cost of going out to lunch once a month, you can help one of your favorite free software projects (and get a cool t-shirt and stickers!) Join <a href="http://www.gnome.org/friends/">Friends of GNOME</a> today!</p>

            <description>I’m a bit behind in my blogging. After getting home from GCDS, and spending the weekend with the family, and then catching up on work after a week of vacation, I’m way overdue to blog.
The GNOME Marketing BoF was the last session on Thursday at GCDS, and the last I attended before heading home Friday. Even with the room hot and sticky, everyone was engaged, and had lots of great ideas and feedback to share.</description>

<p>The GNOME Marketing BoF was the last session on Thursday at GCDS, and the last I attended before heading home Friday. Even with the room hot and sticky, everyone was engaged, and had lots of great ideas and feedback to share. I’d like to give a great big thank you to those that were in attendance, especially as the annual football match and local tour were going on at the same time.</p>
<p>We’ve got a lot going on – some of the things we discussed that we need to add or update in our release calendar include:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNOME 3.0 Marketing Campaign – Feedback was great, lots of stuff to do! From the campaign itself to writing and presenting at conferences to creating a video campaign, there is a lot of cool stuff we can do to educate GNOME users about the changes GNOME 3.0 will introduce.</li>
<li>Case studies. Putting together case studies on the success GNOME and its downstream partners have can be a powerful tool. And a big thank you to Novell offering, and immediately following through, on a great success story.</li>
<li>Social Media. Starting with Thomas’ PR talk on Wednesday, and continuing on Thursday, a lot of great ideas were shared that show there is a lot of low hanging fruit we can do in the social marketing space.</li>
<li>GNOME Press Team. More to come on this soon! The short story is we have an opportunity to build a team that tracks worldwide events and talk about them to the press. This includes conferences, talks, events and more, and helping put the press releases together and be available as a contact to journalists to answer questions.</li>
<li>GNOME website. I’m going to send out an update soon on the content the marketing team is responsible for in writing and editing for the new gnome.org.</li>
<li>Friends of GNOME. We’ve had some great success so far this year in raising money to help GNOME. And there is more coming! We need to continue to build on this success through fundraising activity, and we have some cool things planned.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re interested in helping out and spreading the word about GNOME, now is a great time to <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/marketing-list">join the Marketing team</a>!</p>

            <description>One of the highlights for me at GUADEC was the compliments I received on GNOME Journal. After over a year of inactivity, we have successfully revived GNOME Journal, with two releases within 60 days of each, and I have to admit, I enjoyed the recognition it gave me.
With that said, we are working on the next issue of GNOME Journal, which will be a special edition devoted to this past GCDS / GUADEC.</description>

Was it your first GUADEC and you’d be interesting in sharing your impressions, what you liked, and what you saw?

            <description>I continue to have a great time here at the Gran Canaria Desktop Summit. I keep putting off blogging as I’m just overwhelmed with everything going through my head, and trying to make a succinct blog post has been a challenge.
One of the best parts, especially as it’s my first GUADEC, is how welcoming everyone is. I think I’ve had lunch or dinner with a different group of people every meal.</description>

<p>One of the best parts, especially as it’s my first GUADEC, is how welcoming everyone is. I think I’ve had lunch or dinner with a different group of people every meal. (The meals here are pretty good, but the conversations are even better).</p>
<p>I had the opportunity Monday to give an update on Documentation in the GNOME 3.0 Status session. It’s a bit intimidating standing in a spotlight (literally) and talking for 3-5 minutes about everything we’re doing. (Yes, Shaun, I made sure to make a point you released Mallard after 4 long years, though I forgot to give Bastien credit for helping fix my laptop so I have Mallard working on it). I was very nervous – I really need to practice my public speaking skills, especially as I want to do more talks for Marketing later in the year on the upcoming GNOME 3.0 release.</p>
<p>I also met Thomas, who does a lot of work on GNOME PR here in Europe and Germany, including working in the Press Room here at Gran Canaria for the Desktop Summit, and he had some great ideas of how we can improve our marketing communications, and some fair challenges about how it’s been done in the past. I look forward to working on bringing some of those ideas to life.</p>
<p>Speaking of Marketing, yesterday I had the chance to talk about the work the Marketing team is doing before the Advisory Board. I thought it went pretty well, and it wouldn’t have happened without Claus’ work on the marketing campaign on the Marketing wiki. I had a great conversation with Andreas last night as well, and I’m glad we have the Art team’s support with some of the ideas we have. I’m happy that a few people have come up to me and volunteered to help out more with Marketing stuff. Definitely need to get that task list and release calendar ready! And please come to the Marketing BoF at 3:00 tomorrow to learn more, though I’m guessing a lot of people will be doing the local tour.</p>
<p>The only downside to going to the Advisory Board meeting was missing a couple of the sessions I really wanted to see late yesterday afternoon. I need to go track Aaron down and learn more about what’s new in Banshee!</p>
<p>I’ve also recruited a few more writers for GNOME Journal – don’t forget, if you have a cool app you want to talk about or demo, please come find me. I’d love to turn those into articles for GNOME Journal later in the year.</p>

            <description>My head is still buzzing from all the activity here at Gran Canaria. This is both my first time at GUADEC, and in Europe. That, combined with all the different people I’ve been meeting and conversations I’ve been having, has my head spinning in a good way.
I’ve really gotten a kick out of meeting people, and the reactions I get:
 I’m the GNOME Journal guy. Please come see me, I need writers!</description>

<p>I’ve really gotten a kick out of meeting people, and the reactions I get:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m the GNOME Journal guy. Please come see me, I need writers! And Jorge and I have something special planned for Wednesday, so make sure you find one of us.</li>
<li>I’m the GNOME Docs guy. “You sure blog a lot!” Well sure, I write stuff.</li>
<li>I’m the GNOME marketing guy. This one might make me the happiest, as I’ve blogged the least about it. We have some pretty cool stuff lined up for the Marketing team, and I’ll make sure I blog about it soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>The talks have been great so far. I enjoyed r0ml’s keynote yesterday the most. I wish I could verbalize all the thoughts in my head around his talk, but it was a great way to think about code. RMS’ talk, well, not so much, as others <a href="http://macslow.net/?p=350">have</a> <a href="http://opensourcetogo.blogspot.com/2009/07/good-gcds-beginning-with-significant.html">blogged</a>.</p>
<p>Today’s sessions were great – a good one on Community from Alexandra of Nokia, and Owen’s talk on GNOME Shell was awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone in the community for making me feel welcome, I’m having a great time here!</p>

            <description>Tomorrow night at this time, thanks to the generosity of the GNOME Foundation which is sponsoring my travel, I will be on a flight (hopefully asleep) crossing the Atlantic. I’m heading to Europe for the first time to attend the Gran Canaria Desktop Summit. (My wife is fairly annoyed my first trip to Europe does not include her, but that’s another story).
A few of us from the GNOME Journal team will be there – if you have an idea for an article, interview, or a cool app to show off, please look me up.</description>

            <description>The American Marketing Association defines marketing as:
 Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.
 I don’t think there is a question that GNOME has value for customers, clients, partners and society at large.
It’s our job to shout about that value from the rooftops, far and wide.
Right now though, we need to focus on the first part of that sentence:</description>

            <title>GNOME Docs Hackfest Part II</title>

            <description>Day three of the Writing Open Source conference was our hackfest. I previously showed off Milo’s work in Part I, but it’s probably best to start at the beginning.
We started day three by applying some of what we had learned over the first two days. When writing, especially documentation, it is best to plan your work. This includes knowing your audience, their personas, and understanding their needs.
Lynda Chiotti, with help from Janet Swisher, led us through a brainstorming exercise.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Day three of the <a href="http://www.writingopensource.com">Writing Open Source</a> conference was our hackfest. I previously <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=1167">showed off Milo’s work in Part I</a>, but it’s probably best to start at the beginning.</p>
<p>We started day three by applying some of what we had learned over the first two days. When writing, especially documentation, it is best to plan your work. This includes knowing your audience, their personas, and understanding their needs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chiotti.com/">Lynda Chiotti</a>, with help from <a href="http://www.janetswisher.com/">Janet Swisher</a>, led us through a brainstorming exercise. <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-doc-list/2009-June/msg00006.html">Using a mind mapping tool, we brainstormed</a> what users want to do (and might need help with) when using their computer.</p>
<p>This was important for a few different reasons. For GNOME 3.0, we want to re-write the GNOME User Guide as topic based help using Mallard. Re-creating might be a better word, as we are going to switch licenses from the GFDL to CC-SA 3.0, and it’s probably easier to re-write it from scratch than to contact all the previous authors over the years to get permission. More importantly, we need to think like our users. How many times do we, as GNOME power users and developers, talk to ourselves, and not think like the average computer user? If this user needs help, does our documentation help them? Do they get frustrated and stop using GNOME or GNOME applications? We have a unique opportunity to use both our tools and the launch of GNOME 3.0 to radically improve our documentation and help our users.</p>
<p>After that, Phil, Milo, Shaun and I spent some time talking about how we could improve the GNOME Documentation Project. There were no sacred cows, and we’ve launched an effort to overhaul the docs team, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding simple tasks that new contributors can do and then build on (thanks Emma!)</li>
<li>Focusing the docs team on writers, editors, and translators. Each perform different, but similar roles, including crossover. We need to improve our tools for each team, and communication.</li>
<li>Holding more regular meetings, including a monthly project meeting, and weekly community sessions to encourage participation</li>
<li>Developing a roadmap of tasks we want to accomplish, including both the documentation itself and the tools</li>
<li>Understanding Shaun’s role as our fearless documentation project leader, and how we can help him to free him up and not having the team be blocked on any one person.</li>
<li>Make a significant effort to coordinate with downstream distributions, including meetings and communication, introducing Mallard, and better comments within documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s just the recap! Our wiki space is going through a revamp as we bring this to life, and there is a lot more to come.</p>
<p>Lastly, while Phil and Milo started hacking on Empathy docs using Mallard, I jumped into Bugzilla. Almost half of our open bugs in gnome-user-docs were touched (<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&amp;short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&amp;short_desc=&amp;product=gnome-user-docs&amp;long_desc_type=substring&amp;long_desc=&amp;status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&amp;status_whiteboard=&amp;keywords_type=allwords&amp;keywords=&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;bug_status=NEEDINFO&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;bug_status=CLOSED&amp;emailassigned_to1=1&amp;emailtype1=substring&amp;email1=&amp;emailassigned_to2=1&amp;emailreporter2=1&amp;emailqa_contact2=1&amp;emailcc2=1&amp;emailtype2=substring&amp;email2=&amp;bugidtype=include&amp;bug_id=&amp;chfieldfrom=2009-06-14&amp;chfieldto=Now&amp;chfieldvalue=&amp;cmdtype=doit&amp;order=Reuse+same+sort+as+last+time&amp;field0-0-0=noop&amp;type0-0-0=noop&amp;value0-0-0=">36</a> of 80), and of those 36, 23 were closed. Finally, 16 commits were made to update the current User Guide, including reviewing and patches from contributors. Fun fact (or embarrassing) – the oldest bug fixed was from July, 2006.</p>
<p>Overall, woscon was an amazing experience, and we all learned a lot. A few years from now, we’ll be able to look back and say: “We were there when this began”.</p>
<p>I think I speak for all of the GNOME Docs team members who were there, including Phil, Milo, and Shaun when I say we are sincerely thankful for the GNOME Foundation’s sponsorship of our travel to the Writing Open Source conference. This conference was the brain child of <a href="http://www.emmajane.net/">Emma Jane Hogbin</a>, and we are very grateful for all the time and effort she put in to organizing and hosting woscon.</p>

            <description>(A duck at Inglis Falls, in Owen Sound, Ontario, home of woscon09. If only it had been a mallard…)
Milo Casagrande, who attended woscon09 with the GNOME Docs team last week, has written an introduction to Mallard.
Milo and Phil spent Sunday’s hackfest creating the first Mallard document for use as a help file within an application. We chose Empathy, for a few different reasons, including: it will be in GNOME in 2.</description>

<p><em>(A duck at Inglis Falls, in Owen Sound, Ontario, home of woscon09. If only it had been a mallard…)</em></p>
<p>Milo Casagrande, who attended <a href="http://www.writingopensource.com">woscon09</a> with the GNOME Docs team last week, has <a href="http://milocasagrande.wordpress.com/2009/06/19/taming-the-duck/">written an introduction</a> to <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/mallard/spec.html">Mallard</a>.</p>
<p>Milo and Phil spent Sunday’s hackfest creating the first Mallard document for use as a help file within an application. We chose Empathy, for a few different reasons, including: it will be in GNOME in 2.28; the current documentation is not completed; we want to re-license it from GFDL to CC BY-SA 3.0 and Milo and one other collaborator were the only ones who had worked on it previously (though we fulfill our obligations in re-licensing by the exercise below).</p>
<p>Using the information we learned Friday and Saturday, we spent time planning the document and brainstorming what users want a messaging application to do, and what questions they might have: “How do I….?”.</p>
<p>From there, and with great gusto, Phil and Milo spent the sprint creating a proof of concept help file for Empathy. Not only is it written in Mallard, which can dynamically link the pages, we are focusing on creating topic based help, rather than tasks that take a user step by step in performing an action. Phil and Milo will probably have words with me, but you can follow along on the <a href="http://gitorious.org/empathy-mallard">empathy-mallard branch in Gitorious</a>.</p>
<p>You will need Yelp 2.27.1 and gnome-doc-utils 0.17.1 to see a Mallard doc in Yelp. And now I have to go figure out why Yelp isn’t cooperating with me.</p>

            <description>One of the things I learned last weekend at woscon09, was the importance of planning when beginning to write documentation.
With that in mind, and the GNOME Documentation Project’s focus on moving to topic based documentation, the goal of writing docs for Banshee is to answer the question “How do I…?” for users.
So let’s kick off writing the first ever integrated help file for Banshee!
Knowing that, have you come across any forum posts, blog posts, information on a wiki, or howto’s about Banshee?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I learned last weekend at <a href="http://www.writingopensource.com">woscon09</a>, was the importance of planning when beginning to write documentation.</p>
<p>With that in mind, and the GNOME Documentation Project’s focus on moving to topic based documentation, the goal of writing docs for Banshee is to answer the question “How do I…?” for users.</p>
<p>So let’s kick off writing the first ever integrated help file for <a href="http://banshee-project.org/">Banshee!</a></p>
<p>Knowing that, have you come across any forum posts, blog posts, information on a wiki, or howto’s about Banshee? Do you know a trick or tip about Banshee most people might not know? You needn’t have written it, I’m just looking for links. If you have some to share, please leave a comment on my blog. (I have an over-aggressive spam filter, but I’ll be actively monitoring it).</p>
<p>I’ve brainstormed my own topics for user help, and have the start of a table of contents, but I’d love this to be a community effort. As I see good information out in the community, my goal is to contact the author and see if they’re willing to help with Banshee docs. The Banshee documentation will be one of the first help documents in GNOME to move to a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC-SA 3.0 license</a>, and if the authors want to help, that’s the only requirement. CC-SA 3.0 automatically gives attribution as well.</p>
<p>My last goal is to write the Banshee docs in <a href="http://live.gnome.org/ProjectMallard">Mallard</a>, now that support support for Mallard is in GNOME 2.27. And if you want to help, don’t be intimated by that! We’ll do the markup for you if you’re new to GNOME docs and have good information to share!</p>
<p>I’ve started a <a href="http://gitorious.org/~pcutler/banshee/docs">docs branch on the Banshee repository on Gitorious</a> which is where active development will take place.</p>
<p>And speaking of attribution, I can’t take credit for this idea. A big thank you to <a href="http://www.emmajane.net">Emma</a> at woscon09 last weekend for encouraging me to get the community involved.</p>
<p>So what topics do you think should be in the Banshee help file? What information about Banshee have you come across on the internet that should be shared with other users?</p>

            <description>_(The Ginger Press Cafe where the work, talk and laughter happened at woscon09)
_
One of the most important take-aways for me personally from woscon09 were the talks on community. This included Addy’s keynote Friday on herding cats, the challenges that spanned all of our groups, discussion around upstream to downstream and back again, and encouraging new volunteers.
With that in mind, we’re making some changes to the Docs team to improve our community involvement.</description>

<p>With that in mind, we’re making some changes to the Docs team to improve our community involvement.</p>
<p>Last night, <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-doc-list/2009-June/msg00009.html">Shaun sent an email to the list detailing some of the changes</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community Management</li>
<li>Editorial assistance</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>Upstreaming downstream</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, we are all responsible for writing.</p>
<p>With that said, I’ve spent some time over the last day or two re-organizing our wiki, and have put together a <a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Community">stub of a page around Community.</a></p>
<p>We will be having our first Q&amp;A session this week, starting tomorrow night at 9 p.m. CST (2:00 a.m. UTC). We are committed to having these meetings, and moving the day and times around to get as much representation worldwide as we can.</p>
<p>The theme of tomorrow’s meeting is a recap of what we learned at woscon09. However, please bring any questions. Want to know how to get involved? What to write? How to use bugzilla? This is an open session, and more than anything, it’s to let folks know that we will be in IRC at a given time to answer any question (within reason). Stop by #docs on GIMPnet IRC tomorrow night!</p>
<p>We’ve also started a <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/docs">Docs Team blog</a> where we will be posting meeting announcements, recaps, and other important information that we wish to share with the community.</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to help out? Feel you can write technical documentation? Have above average grammar and spelling and want to edit? Translate our docs? Now is the time to get involved. We have lots of exciting things planned for this year, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

            <description>(Inglis Falls, just outside of Owen Sound, Ontario)
My head is still spinning after 3 days at woscon09.
I learned so much and met so many great people. Over the coming days and weeks I’ll be blogging more about it.
Some key things I left with (in no particular order):
 Know your audience. (True in marketing, and also true in doc writing). Develop personas for your audience. Plan, plan, plan Tons of community management stuff, such as make it easy to get involved, and have tasks ready that are simple (think stuffing envelopes) Speaking of community, we all have similar challenges, no matter the project Mallard exists!</description>

<p>My head is still spinning after 3 days at woscon09.</p>
<p>I learned so much and met so many great people. Over the coming days and weeks I’ll be blogging more about it.</p>
<p>Some key things I left with (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Know your audience. (True in marketing, and also true in doc writing). Develop personas for your audience.</li>
<li>Plan, plan, plan</li>
<li>Tons of community management stuff, such as make it easy to get involved, and have tasks ready that are simple (think stuffing envelopes)</li>
<li>Speaking of community, we all have similar challenges, no matter the project</li>
<li><a href="http://live.gnome.org/ProjectMallard">Mallard</a> exists!</li>
<li>Owen Sound is a beautiful small town.</li>
<li>I knew this already, but it was reinforced: hacking in person is much more fun</li>
<li>I’d rather clean up bugzilla one bug at a time when they come in, rather than spending hours sifting through old bugs</li>
<li>There are a ton of things we can do to improve upstream and downstream communication and collaboration.</li>
<li>Topic based documentation is much better than task based documentation.</li>
<li>Re-writing GNOME docs as topic based help is a mammoth sized task.</li>
<li>A few years from now, I’m going to look back and say, “I was there when it first started”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly: <strong>Write every day</strong>. You can expect more blog posts, documentation updates, and contributions to GNOME marketing and the web content with that in mind.</p>
<p>And those are just off the top of my head! There was so much more. And if you were following along on Twitter or identi.ca Saturday night, you may not have gotten the jokes without the context of being there, but trust me, I haven’t laughed that hard in a log time.</p>
<p>Thanks again to <a href="http://www.emmajane.net/">Emma</a> for conceiving woscon09 and hosting. If you are interested in technical writing, check out the <a href="http://www.writingopensource.com">Writing Open Source</a> website, where this brand new community is just getting started. Contribute, read our forums, or read our Planet to learn more about writing docs for free software projects.</p>

            <description>We’re just over halfway done with day 2 of the Writing Open Source conference, and today is an “unconference” day in the style of BarCamp.
Conference attendees are giving talks today inspired by conversations from yesterday, other ideas attendees had, and more.
GNOME’s own fearless documentation leader, Shaun McCance, kicked off day two this morning giving an overview of Project Mallard.

<p>Conference attendees are giving talks today inspired by conversations from yesterday, other ideas attendees had, and more.</p>
<p>GNOME’s own fearless documentation leader, <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/shaunm">Shaun McCance</a>, kicked off day two this morning giving an overview of Project Mallard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/3623127846/" title="shaun-mallard-talk by silwenae, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>(Please note that the picture on the projector is a wood duck, and not a Mallard. You’ll have to ask Shaun for the story. Picture courtesy of Milo Casagrande).</p>
<p>Shaun talked about his design goals for Mallard, the benefits of using it instead of using Docbook, and showed it working in Yelp(!), the GNOME help browser. Shaun also discussed and demonstrated <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/pulse/web/">Pulse</a>, and you could tell how much passion he has for documentation and the tools involved.</p>
<p>We also had talks about how we can make docs easier for translators (and I showed off <a href="http://l10n.gnome.org/">Damned Lies</a>, which is so cool, especially considering how little I know about it), how an organization could create a certification program, creating a book in 5 days or less, and my personal favorite, communities. We talked about how different communities that are represented here at the conference work, how upstream and downstream work, what’s not working, how we could be doing community outreach, and why there is a perception that docs just aren’t cool. (Take it from me, docs are sexy! And there will be more to come on that subject).</p>
<p>One of the coolest things for me at least, so far, is finding these other communities, including Drupal, BSD, XFCE just to name a few that are represented here, and how many commonalities we have. <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> and <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> might not have a lot of common in how documentation is used, but we have similar challenges and processes. We are making friendships that will help us to create documentation best practices that span communities and one of our goals is build on the success of this conference and keep in contact and continue to share information with each other, and recruit more to join us.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is our hack day, and that should be a blast as well.</p>

            <description>The first ever (that we know of) conference for documentation writers in open source conference started today in Owen Sound, Ontario (about 2 hours from Toronto). The Writing Open Source conference is being hosted by Emma Jane Hogbin, and a few of us from GNOME are here:

We’re halfway through the first day, which is keynotes, and the conference is awesome.</description>

<p>(Left to Right: Shaun McCance, Milo Cassagrande, Phil Bull and myself).</p>
<p>We’re halfway through the first day, which is keynotes, and the conference is awesome.</p>
<p>Some random thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>How cool is it that all of our keynote speakers are women? And our conference overall is 50% women / 50% men.</li>
<li>Lots of different projects are represented, including BSD, Drupal, GNOME, XFCE and more.</li>
<li>The keynotes are great. All of us have pages of notes, either on paper, in Tomboy or insert your favorite text editor.</li>
<li>A quarter of attendees have netbooks. There’s a couple of Macs, and the rest of us are on laptops with Linux. I haven’t seen one Windows laptop yet.</li>
<li>Experience ranges from published authors to one individual who’s never contributed but wants to learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>Belinda from Canonical is talking now, and she has goodies and exercises for us to do, so I have to run. More to come. You can follow along on Twitter or identi.ca with the #woscon09 hash tag too.</p>

            <description>Later this week, I have the opportunity, along with Shaun McCance, Phil Bull and Milo Casagrande, to attend the Writing Open Source conference, which is thought to be the first conference to be focused on open source and documentation. We will have keynotes on Friday, an unconference on Saturday, and a GNOME documentation hackfest on Sunday.
GNOME is sponsoring four of us to go from a donation by Intel. Each of us is paying the conference fee out of pocket, and GNOME has subsidized our airfare and lodging (I paid for my own airfare).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Later this week, I have the opportunity, along with <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/shaunm/">Shaun McCance</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~philbull">Phil Bull</a> and <a href="https://launchpad.net/~milo">Milo Casagrande</a>, to attend the <a href="http://www.writingopensource.com">Writing Open Source</a> conference, which is thought to be the first conference to be focused on open source and documentation. We will have keynotes on Friday, an unconference on Saturday, and a GNOME documentation hackfest on Sunday.</p>
<p>GNOME is sponsoring four of us to go from a donation by Intel. Each of us is paying the conference fee out of pocket, and GNOME has subsidized our airfare and lodging (I paid for my own airfare).</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be cool if GNOME could sponsor more hackfests and travel subsidies for GNOME hackers each year?</p>
<p>If you <a href="http://www.gnome.org/friends/about-foundation.html">look at this page</a>, GNOME’s goals from the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/friends/">Friends of GNOME program</a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Produce more end-user-focused technology and features through technology-specific hackfests. Hackfests are events where a core team of project developers get together and spend a week in the same place, discussing plans and writing code. They are particularly useful for getting new projects or large features launched (like GTK+ 3.0) or getting a large amount of code written.</li>
<li>Provide travel subsidies to bring our worldwide community of volunteer developers together. This enables them to work on existing projects, plan new projects, and work with partners and companies that use GNOME technologies.</li>
<li>Support local conferences such as GNOME.Asia, GUADLAC (Latin America), the Boston Summit, GNOME.conf.au (Australia), and Forum GNOME. Local conferences provide a forum for building community, sharing technology, and bringing developers, companies, and users closer together.</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is just three of the twelve goals the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/friends/">Friends of GNOME program</a> is trying to support!</p>
<p>I understand these are tough economic times. If you can, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/friends/">any support you can give</a> helps. I’d also ask you to consider the “Adopt a Hacker” option at $10 a month. This helps you by being a small amount each month, rather than a larger one time donation, and by donating monthly helps GNOME plan more effectively through having a consistent monthly revenue source.</p>
<p>And don’t forget about the <a href="http://mces.blogspot.com/2009/06/love-gnome-show-your-support.html">framed GNOME artwork Behdad blogged</a> about last week! The first person who donates at the Philanthropist level gets this one of a kind engraved plaque.</p>
<p>I became a <a href="http://www.gnome.org/friends/">Friend of GNOME</a> this past April, will you?</p>

            <description>The Linux Journal has recently published the 2009 Reader’s Choice Awards.
GNOME was voted, by readers, as the “Favorite Desktop Environment” garnering 53% of the votes, with KDE in second place at 30%.
From the article:
 During the past year, GNOME has reached majority rule status, with 53% of you electing it your favorite desktop environment. This trend is despite the breakneck development of KDE 4 during the past year.</description>

<p>GNOME was voted, by readers, as the “Favorite Desktop Environment” garnering 53% of the votes, with KDE in second place at 30%.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the past year, GNOME has reached majority rule status, with 53% of you electing it your favorite desktop environment. This trend is despite the breakneck development of KDE 4 during the past year. Although GNOME garnered only a few more votes than it did in 2008, KDE’s vote count slipped as you’ve warmed to Xfce, Fluxbox and Enlightenment. The long and influential coattails of Ubuntu can only make any presidential candidate green with envy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flattering words indeed!</p>
<p>Contrast that to the <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7724">2004 Readers’ Choice Awards</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Favorite Desktop Environment</p>
<ol>
<li>KDE</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>GNOME</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Window Maker</li>
</ol>
<p>For several years now, KDE and GNOME have finished first and second, respectively, <strong><em>with an ever-increasing distance between the two. This year, KDE received two votes for every one GNOME received</em></strong>. Window Maker holds on to the number three spot, beating XFce by a single vote. No one said “they all suck” this year, and the only write-in voter who expressed frustration said he might try to write his own environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine).</p>
<p>I think the GNOME community should be very proud of the progress made within GNOME, which is reflected in these vote totals.</p>
<p>(Thanks to Claus on the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/marketing-list">marketing list</a> for pointing out the latest Readers’ Choice awards).</p>

            <description>I would like to thank the Planet GNOME editors (Jeff, Lucas &amp;amp; Vincent) for adding my blog.
A brief introduction – I’ve been using GNOME for 10 years, and I started contributing a little bit on and off a couple years ago, mostly with the Marketing team on the GNOME web revamp, Tomboy documentation and also GNOME Journal. This year I’ve become much more active, joining the Sysadmin team, submitting a number of documentation patches, becoming the release manager for GNOME Journal, and spending more time with the Marketing and Web teams.</description>

            <description>Tomboy was one of the first GNOME products I contributed code (documentation) to. It also is one of my all time favorite apps and one I can’t do without on a day to day basis. Whether it’s jotting down ideas I don’t want to forget, to-do lists, or organizing the release plan for the next GNOME Journal, I always have a bunch of notes open.
A few weeks ago, I finally got around to trying to sync my notes via sshfs on my desktop and laptop.</description>

Whether it’s jotting down ideas I don’t want to forget, to-do lists, or organizing the release plan for the next GNOME Journal, I always have a bunch of notes open.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I finally got around to trying to sync my notes via sshfs on my desktop and laptop. And, to be frank, it was a pain in the butt, and not documented well. It’s working, but I don’t think it’s working quite right yet.</p>
<p>Which is why I couldn’t be more excited for <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Snowy">Snowy</a>. Snowy is a web application for synchronizing, viewing, sharing, and editing your Tomboy notes online. Snowy will power the Tomboy Online service, and in addition to syncing your own notes online, let you also share and edit with friends.</p>
<p>Best of all, Snowy will be <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">Affero GPL</a> licensed – so if you want to run your own Snowy server and sync your notes there, you can! (It’s similar to <a href="http://identi.ca">identi.ca</a> – <a href="http://laconi.ca/trac/">laconica</a> is the open source software that powers identi.ca, and you could run your own microblog server on laconica if you wanted to).</p>
<p>I recommend reading Sandy Armstrong’s (lead developer of Tomboy) <a href="http://automorphic.blogspot.com/2009/05/tomboy-0151-release-brings-new-online.html">blog post on Tomboy and Snowy</a> (including an early screenshot), and Brad Taylor’s (lead developer of Snowy) <a href="http://brad.getcoded.net/blog/entry.php?e=348085118">blog post introducing Snowy</a>. (And the title of this blog post is stolen right from Brad’s mouth).</p>
<p>More to come!</p>

            <description>I haven’t used Ubuntu in over two and a half years, but I’ve been watching the debate raging with the launch of Ubuntu One last week with interest.
In my opinion, the best commentary on the matter so far has been by Jim Campbell, an Ubuntu member, on his blog. I encourage you to read his take on it, and also the second comment posted.</description>

            <description>I’m going to GUADEC this year!
In all my travels, I’ve visited almost all 50 states in the U.S., but I’ve never travelled internationally. Now in the span of 30 days, I’ll be visiting both Canada and Europe – and both are related for GNOME events. And I’d like to say a big thank you to GNOME for helping subsidize my travel to both events.
The initial GUADEC schedule was posted this morning, and I’m excited (and nervous) that Stormy’s and my Birds of a Feather session on GNOME marketing was accepted!</description>

<p>In all my travels, I’ve visited almost all 50 states in the U.S., but I’ve never travelled internationally. Now in the span of 30 days, I’ll be visiting both <a href="http://www.writingopensource.com/">Canada</a> and <a href="http://www.grancanariadesktopsummit.org/">Europe</a> – and both are related for GNOME events. And I’d like to say a big thank you to GNOME for helping subsidize my travel to both events.</p>
<p>The initial <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~behdad/guadec/2009/schedule/">GUADEC schedule</a> was posted this morning, and I’m excited (and nervous) that Stormy’s and my Birds of a Feather session on GNOME marketing was accepted! (Thursday, 10:00 a.m.). I was hoping to fly back home Friday morning, but now I need to find a way to stay to see <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~behdad/guadec/2009/schedule/docs-bof.bio.html">Davyd</a>‘s <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~behdad/guadec/2009/schedule/docs-bof.abs.html">talk on Documentation</a> Friday morning.</p>
<p>In related GUADEC news, we at the <a href="http://www.gnomejournal.org">GNOME Journal</a> are publishing a GUADEC special edition. Are you going to GUADEC? Have an interesting idea for an article – maybe from a talk you want to attend to learn about (and share about with the GNOME Journal audience!) or someone you might want to interview face to face while at Gran Canaria? Let us know, <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-journal-list/2009-May/msg00019.html">more info is available here</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll be seeing you in July in Gran Canaria.</p>

            <description>Lots of stuff going on in the world of GNOME for me!
Attended a few meetings last week with GNOME related projects.
This past Sunday, April 19th, the Documentation team met for the first time in a while. Shaun gave an update on the status of Mallard, the new markup language for GNOME Docs; a possible change to how we license docs; an introduction to Pulse and some brainstorming on new ways to bring guides to users.</description>

<p>Attended a few meetings last week with GNOME related projects.</p>
<p>This past Sunday, April 19th, the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Meeting20090419">Documentation team met</a> for the first time in a while. Shaun gave an update on the status of Mallard, the new markup language for GNOME Docs; a possible change to how we license docs; an introduction to Pulse and some brainstorming on new ways to bring guides to users.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Tomboy/DevMeetingZeroPointSixteen">Tuesday, the Tomboy team</a> met to discuss the road to a 1.0 release. More exciting though is the news on the work being done around syncing for Tomboy, including a potential online syncing service for users. As someone who’s lazy, and not that technical, but owns multiple computers that use Tomboy, I’m very excited about the potential a syncing service has. (And if you want to help update the <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/">Tomboy end user website</a>, please let me know!)</p>
<p>Related to the Documentation news though, I’m happy to announce I’ll be attending the first ever Open Source Documentation conference, <a href="http://www.writingopensource.com/">Writing Open Source</a>, in June in Owen Sound, Canada. The GNOME Foundation is graciously covering my lodging, and three other GNOME Documentation team members, including Shaun, will be there. In addition to the tracks on Friday, there is an unconference on Saturday, and we will be having a documentation hackfest on Sunday. The hackfest might also be the first public unveiling of <a href="http://live.gnome.org/ProjectMallard">Mallard</a> as we start working on all new documentation for GNOME 3.0.</p>
<p>I booked my flight and paid for the conference this weekend, now comes the hard part – the waiting until June.</p>

            <title>KVM &amp; Virtual Machine Manager in Foresight</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2009/04/kvm-virtual-machine-manager-in-foresight/</link>

            <description>Foresight has long been a proponent of KVM over other virtualization technologies such as Xen or Virtualbox.
If you, like me, aren’t a guru on the command line and prefer using a GUI, Virtual Machine Manager is available in the Foresight repositories. If you’ve used Virtualbox or VMWare, you’ll find virtual-manager very familiar. The only downside (for some), is that you will need a modern processor that supports Intel VT or AMD-V.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Foresight has long been a proponent of <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page">KVM</a> over other virtualization technologies such as Xen or Virtualbox.</p>
<p>If you, like me, aren’t a guru on the command line and prefer using a GUI, <a href="http://virt-manager.et.redhat.com/">Virtual Machine Manager</a> is available in the Foresight repositories. If you’ve used Virtualbox or VMWare, you’ll find virtual-manager very familiar. The only downside (for some), is that you will need a modern processor that supports Intel VT or AMD-V.</p>
<p>Let’s get started:</p>
<p>In this example, we will use an ISO of a Linux distribution. Go ahead and download an ISO of a Linux distro you’d like to try out.</p>
<p>From a command line install the tools you’ll need:</p>
<p><code>sudo conary update virt-manager libvirt</code></p>
<p>You’ll want to install it from the command line, as PackageKit has a bug that it doesn’t pull in libvirt:runtime for some reason. (<a href="https://issues.foresightlinux.org/browse/FL-2050">FL-2050</a>)</p>
<p>Start the service:</p>
<p><code>sudo service libvirtd start</code></p>
<p>Go to Applications -&gt; System Tools and choose Virtual Machine Manager.</p>
<p>PolicyKit will prompt you for your password. Enter it and Virtual Manager will start.</p>
<p>Click on localhost.</p>
<p>Then click File -&gt; Add Connection and click Connect.</p>
<p>Click New in the bottom right hand corner. You will be prompted to enter the name of your new Virtual Machine.</p>
<p>You will now be present with 5 steps to create your Virtual Machine:</p>
<p>Step 1: Enter the name of VM you wan to create</p>
<p>Step 2: Click on “Use ISO Image” and then “Browse” and chose the ISO you downloaded earlier. Then from the drop down boxes choose Linux, and in the second drop down box you can check if the distro you’re trying is available.</p>
<p>Step 3: Choose how much RAM and how many CPUs the VM can use</p>
<p>Step 4: The defaults should work – choose to enable storage, and how much hard drive space the VM can use. (I’ve learned that hard drive space is important – these VMs need more than you think they will!)</p>
<p>Step 5: The defaults should work here as well, but you can click on Advanced Options if you want to change the Networking options. I’ve never had to change anything here, and Networking has worked out of the box.</p>
<p>And that’s it! Now under “localhost” double click the name of the VM you created, and it will boot up, just like a computer was booting up. You’ll install the Linux distro, just like you would on to a hard drive. One thing I’ve noticed, is that after an installation, it needs to reboot. My experience is the VM shuts down, rather than rebooting, but just starting it up again, the VM will boot up th eOS after your install.</p>
<p>To use the mouse, just click your mouse inside the virtual machine. To regain control of your mouse, press control and alt and your mouse will work normally inside Foresight again.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of Virtual Machine Manager running while the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeDeveloperKit">GNOME Dev Kit</a> loads (note I have created VMs for the Dev Kit and the betas of Fedora 11 and Ubuntu 9.04:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/3466022913/" title="GNOME Dev Kit by silwenae, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>This screenshot shows the GNOME Dev Kit and Fedora 11 running side by side (One interesting thing about running Fedora is that i don’t have to release the mouse via ctrl-alt, it’s automatic within the OS. I’m not sure why, maybe it’s because Virtual Machine Manager is developed by Red Hat?):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/3466838632/" title="Virtual Machines by silwenae, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>If you have a modern processor, the hard drive space, and some memory to spare, I highly recommend Virtual Machine Manager. It makes creating and running different operating systems a breeze.</p>

            <description>There is a GNOME Documentation Team meeting this Sunday, at 17:00 UTC.
I am a suckervolunteered to help Shaun McCance facilitate the meeting. Here is the meeting announcement I just sent to the mailing list:
 Are you a seasoned and wily Docbook veteran? New to writing documentation and don’t know where to start? Now is a great time to join the team!

I will do my best to help facilitate the Q&amp;A, but there may be questions that we won’t be ableto answer and have to come back to at a later date.</p>
<p>I also recommend reading Shaun’s latest blog post with his personal goals for GNOME – <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/shaunm/2009/04/14/my-goals/">http://blogs.gnome.org/shaunm/2009/04/14/my-goals/</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you have a blog or micro-blog, spread the word about the meeting and let’s see if we can’t get some new faces to come. We have lots of work to do as we work towards GNOME 3.0!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to everyone who is coming, and for those who can’t make this time, I will keep notes and publish them.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

            <description>I’m a big fan of microblogging, using both Twitter and identi.ca. Microblogging, if you don’t know, is sending a short message that is 140 characters or less – so you have to be short and sweet in your message. (Did I mention it’s been 2 years since I started using Twitter? Where does the time go!?)
My favorite microblogging client for the Linux desktop is Gwibber. Unfortunately there is a nasty bug with WebKit and Gwibber that has caused Gwibber to stop working.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m a big fan of microblogging, using both <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://identi.ca">identi.ca</a>. Microblogging, if you don’t know, is sending a short message that is 140 characters or less – so you have to be short and sweet in your message. (Did I mention it’s been 2 years since I started using Twitter? Where does the time go!?)</p>
<p>My favorite microblogging client for the Linux desktop is <a href="https://launchpad.net/gwibber">Gwibber</a>. Unfortunately there is a <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/gwibber/+bug/304033">nasty bug with WebKit and Gwibber</a> that has caused Gwibber to stop working. This is affecting most distributions, not just Foresight. Unfortunately, when we ship Foresight 2.1.1 (probably) later this week, Gwibber won’t work anymore, as I found out Monday when I updated to the QA version of Foresight.</p>
<p>Thanks to misa, I found out earlier this afternoon that there is a stopgap solution using <a href="http://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> and the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/microblog-purple/">microblog-purple plug-in</a> for Pidgin.</p>
<p>In Foresight, click on Applications -&gt; Add / Remove Software and search for “pidgin-microblog” or in a terminal, do:</p>
<p><code>sudo conary update pidgin-microblog</code></p>
<p>Then in Pidgin, go to Tools – Plugins and enable the “Twitgin” plugin. Then go to Accounts -&gt; Add, and add your Twitter or Identi.ca account like you would add a new IM account.</p>
<p>When Twitter or Identi.ca updates, it will open a new window, just like any other IM conversation, with your friends’ updates. I just leave the window open, and notify-osd shows me the updates in my notification window. You can also post your updates from within that same window.</p>
<p>If you, like me, were or will go through withdrawal from microblogging when you get hit with the Gwibber / Webkit bug, try the Pidgin plugin out, works pretty well. (And if you’re daring, there is a newer version in the fl:2-devel repo you can try too).</p>
<p>If you want to follow my microblogging, I’m on Twitter as paul_cutler and identica as pcutler. (Giving my silwenae nick a rest for the moment).</p>

            <description>GNOME Journal, the online magazine dedicated to everything surrounding the GNOME Desktop, needs your help!
We haven’t published an edition of the GNOME Journal since December 2007, and work is ramping up to get a new edition published.
What kind of help do we need? I’m glad you asked! It might not be what you think. We need:
 CSS / HTML hackers – We are migrating GNOME Journal from it’s current CMS to WordPress, and we have some final touches that need to be fixed on our WordPress theme, as well as the look and feel of the archives section.</description>

            <description>I’ve been chronicling my learning on writing documentation for GNOME. In Part I, I covered getting up to speed on GNOME documentation and the tools available; and in Part II I wrote about picking a project that you want to help, getting involved, and setting up your environment and finding updates that need to be made.
Now it’s time to apply those needed updates to the documentation and write some actual code in Docbook.</description>

In <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=1074">Part I, I covered</a> getting up to speed on GNOME documentation and the tools available; and in <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=1081">Part II I wrote</a> about picking a project that you want to help, getting involved, and setting up your environment and finding updates that need to be made.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to apply those needed updates to the documentation and write some actual code in Docbook.</p>
<p>As the Tracking Documentation Status page on LGO mentions, there are a few different ways writers can update a doc, including getting the relevant content in, but not updating all of the markup; writing the chapter headings to capture sections that need to be updated, but not adding the content yet; or working through the document step by step updating the content and markup.</p>
<p>I do the latter – I work sequentially through the document updating the markup and content. As I mentioned in Part II, I use Tomboy to capture my research on what updates the document needs, such as new features or bugs filed in Bugzilla.</p>
<p>Let’s start at the beginning of a document and work our way through it. I’m going to assume you’ll pickup the Docbook markup as you go, or have some familiararity with it. When I first started working on the Foresight User Guide a year and a half ago, I had no experience with it either. I would not claim I know it well at this point either – most of my experience comes from doing what we are about to do – just editing existing documentation, or at least using that as a base.</p>
<p>In Part II, you checked out the Tomboy source code out of GNOME Subversion. In your favorite text editor, open the Tomboy help file located in $/home/source/tomboy/help/C/tomboy.xml</p>
<p>Working through tomboy.xml section by section:</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<pre><code>&lt;code markup=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;abstract role=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/abstract&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Find the above code snippet in tomboy.xml. This is the description of the project. Why is this important you may ask? Did you know that all of GNOME’s help files are also available online at <a href="http://library.gnome.org/users/">http://library.gnome.org/users/</a> ?</p>
<p>If you click on that link and scroll down under “Utilities”, you will find Tomboy, and it’s description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tomboy Notes Manual</p>
<p>Tomboy is a simple desktop note-taking application, with some powerful built-in features to help you organise your ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=500803">Bug 500803</a>, the above description needs to be updated, and this is the section where that change will be applied.</p>
<p>In the xml file, you will see:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;code markup=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;abstract role=&quot;description&quot;&gt;
  &amp;lt;para&gt;Tomboy is a simple desktop note-taking application, with some powerful built-in features to help you organise your ideas.
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/abstract&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Change the text inside the <code>&lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt;</code> tags to:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;abstract role=&ldquo;description&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;para&gt;Tomboy is a simple desktop note-taking application, with many features designed to help organize ideas, such as spell checking, highlighting, auto-linking URLs, lists, font stylizing, quick access with a table of contents for notes, and plug-ins to extend Tomboy&rsquo;s capabilities.
&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/abstract&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Bug fixed!</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Compatibility</strong></p>
<p>Let’s make the Tomboy docs compatible with Pulse. As mentioned in Part I, familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/StatusTracking">Status Tracking</a>. Update the status by adding this block of code, as <a href="http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gnome-devel-docs/trunk/gdp-style-guide/C/gdp-style-guide.xml?r1=581&amp;r2=582">show in this example</a>. This will add a status to the document, that <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/pulse/web/">Pulse</a> can show, that lets other documentation writers know that the document is in the process of being updated, needs a review, or has been finalized.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright &amp; Author Information</strong></p>
<p>Next, take credit for the work you’re doing – add your name to the copyright and author information. This is helpful to other doc writers as well, especially if you don’t have commit access, that other doc writers can reach out to you if they have a question with the last changes made. After the last <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag, update with your name and year:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;code markup=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;copyright&gt;&amp;lt;br /&gt;
  &amp;lt;year&gt;2009&amp;lt;/year&gt;&amp;lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;p&gt;      &lt;holder&gt;Paul Cutler&lt;/holder&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/copyright&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Same under the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;authorgroup&gt; &lt;/authorgroup&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag, this time also including your email address:</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;code markup=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;author&gt;&amp;lt;br /&gt;
    &amp;lt;firstname&gt;Paul&amp;lt;/firstname&gt;&amp;lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;p&gt;        &lt;surname&gt;Cutler&lt;/surname&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        &lt;affiliation&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;orgname&gt;GNOME Documentation Project&lt;/orgname&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;address&gt;&lt;email&gt;pcutler@foresightlinux.org&lt;/email&gt;&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        &lt;/affiliation&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/author&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>For the GNOME 2.26 cycle, I mostly added documentation to make the Tomoby docs reflect that it now works on both GNOME and Microsoft Windows. (Yes, I had to document an app to run on Windows! Who would have ever thought I’d be saying that…)</p>
<p>I’m not going to detail the markup of the changes I made; hopefully you’ll pickup Docbook’s syntax by editing changes inline in the document. (If you’re really curious, you can <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=131458&amp;action=view">see the changes here in Bugzilla</a> – the + denotes lines I added, and the – are lines I removed.) The above changes are changes you almost always want to make each time you update GNOME documentation.</p>
<p>As you document features for the application, think back to Part I, and revisit the <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gdp-style-guide/2.26/">GNOME Style Guide</a>. Think about your audience, and focus on tone. Each documentation writer has their own strengths, whether that is tone, spelling, grammar, docbook markup, etc. Focus on your strengths and let the peer review process help you with the other areas.</p>
<p>Next is one of the most important parts – review your changes! Let’s fire up the xml file in Yelp, the GNOME Help Browser. To do this, Yelp has to call the file from the absolute path. For example, yelp tomboy.xml will not work.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->yelp /home/yourusername/source/tomboy/help/C/tomboy.xml<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And it should start. If Yelp starts, but doesn’t display anything, and an error pops up, close Yelp, and look at your console output. The console will tell you what line the syntax error is occurring that needs to be fixed. When I was first learning Docbook by writing the <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/hg/foresight-user-guide-2/">Foresight User Guide</a>, I would spend twenty to thirty minutes trying to debug where I made an error. It can be frustrating, but you’ll find it.</p>
<p>Check your grammar, your tone, capitalization, and spelling. I will run two instances of Yelp side by side – the version I created / edited, and the actual help file for the application. (Run the application and hit F1 to bring up the help). I will compare the original against the changes I made.</p>
<p>When you’re comfortable with the changes, and Yelp displays everything correctly, it’s time to create a patch to submit those changes. You are probably like me and don’t have commit access to GNOME. Don’t worry though – keep working on GNOME docs and submitting patches and before you know it someone will recommend you be added.</p>
<p>As mentioned in Part II, the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/SVN">GNOME SVN wiki page</a> has the details:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->svn diff [filename] &gt; [patch]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>For Tomboy, I did:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->svn diff tomboy.xml &gt; docs-cross-platform.patch<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I then updated <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=576487">Bug 576487</a> by choosing “Create a New Attachment” in Bugzilla, and filled out the form, noting the changes this patch made to tomboy.xml. I also let Sandy, one of the lead Tomboy developers, know in IRC that the patch was submitted and need a developer review and committed. You may also want to drop an email to the projects list to let them know the patch was submitted.</p>
<p>With that complete, it’s also recommended to have 3 peer reviews done by the GNOME Documentation team. I <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-doc-list/2009-March/msg00054.html">sent an email to the Docs list</a> with a link to my bugs asking for peer reviews of my documentation changes.</p>
<p>As of this writing, I’m waiting to hear back from both my peers on the Docs team and Sandy on the Tomboy team. I’m sure there will be some changes that need to be made, as I’m nowhere close to knowing everything about how to write documentation, but I’m learning.</p>
<p>Once those changes are made, and the reviews are complete, the status will need to be changed to “candidate”. At that point, the GNOME Doc Team leaders will review it one more time, and with their approval, the document will be updated to “final” and committed! And you have officially helped to give back to the GNOME community and make GNOME better.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, this may not be the best way for everyone, or the official way of doing things, but this is what works for me as I work on updating GNOME documentation. I hope you found this helpful, and feel free to leave me a comment below with your thoughts or questions.</p>

            <description>Wil Wheaton is blogging about something I’ve always wanted to do, which is to run a D&amp;amp;D campaign for his son. (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, and Part 5).
I even went so far as a couple of years ago in buying the 3rd edition Players Handbook, DM Guide and Monster Manual, but I never did run a campaign.
Why not?
I suck as a DM.
I’m just not creative or flexible enough that when a player throws me for a curve to react.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wil Wheaton is blogging about something I’ve always wanted to do, which is to run a D&amp;D campaign for his son.

<p>I even went so far as a couple of years ago in buying the 3rd edition Players Handbook, DM Guide and Monster Manual, but I never did run a campaign.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>I suck as a DM.</p>
<p>I’m just not creative or flexible enough that when a player throws me for a curve to react. I’ve also struggled in being descriptive enough in bringing a world to life. Wil Wheaton touches on these and more in Part 5, Lessons Learned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more descriptive, the better. But didn’t I just say keep it simple? Yes, but these things aren’t mutually exclusive. While I can keep the story simple, I can still work hard to make the encounters more than moving figures around and rolling dice. For example, Nolan used a power to rip his maul through a pair of minions who were adjacent to him. He hit them both, but instead of just saying that, I told him, “your maul crashes through its head, streaming blood and gore behind it as the power of your swing carries into the other one. Their bodies fall to the ground with a wet thud.”</p>
<p>When the rogue rolled particularly well with a ranged attack, I told him, “your dagger whistles through the air toward your target, and catches it in the throat as it lunges toward you. Its eyes widen and glaze over as it falls down, dead.”</p>
<p>I also added smells, sounds, and anything else I could do to make the tower they were in really feel old and decaying. It helps that I’ve read more fantasy genre fiction than I’d like to admit.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to improvise. When it looked like the final encounter, which should have delivered the greatest challenge, was going to be a cakewalk, I just looked at some stat blocks and added a few more creatures to the encounter so it would feel more climactic. I knew I had the cleric back in the cell, and if things got really, really bad, he could figure out a way to race in and save the day (as a general rule, though, I don’t recommend doing things like this too frequently, or your players will figure it out and act accordingly.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My son is 13 now. It’s time to get off my butt and see if I can’t figure out how to be a decent DM and get a session going.</p>

            <description>So you’ve decided you want to contribute to GNOME and write some documentation. In Part I, I wrote about the steps I went through to prepare to write GNOME documentation and picking a project.
In Part II, we will take a look at the final preparation stage, including checking out the project’s source code via GNOME Subversion and finding documentation that needs updating. I am still fairly new to the process myself, but these are some of the steps I take in writing documentation.</description>

<p>In Part II, we will take a look at the final preparation stage, including checking out the project’s source code via GNOME Subversion and finding documentation that needs updating. I am still fairly new to the process myself, but these are some of the steps I take in writing documentation.</p>
<p>Part III will cover updating the Docbook XML file, reviewing your changes and submitting a patch with the updated docs.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve picked a project to work on, I recommend subscribing to the project’s mailing list, and, if they have one, hang out in their IRC channel. A list of all <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/">GNOME mailing lists is here</a>, and be aware of the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/">GNOME Code of Conduct</a> when sending an email to a list.</p>
<p>Personally, I recommend letting the project or lead developer(s) know you want to help out. This is helpful for a couple of reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you, like me, are new to contributing to GNOME, you probably don’t have SVN access to commit your changes. A developer on the project, or a member of the GDP if you’re working on a project the GDP can commit, will have to submit your changes to the project.</li>
<li>You might have a question on how a feature works, and want clarification. If you’ve introduced yourself, other project members will understand why you’re asking.</li>
<li>Help is always appreciated! You have nothing to worry about – almost all projects will welcome you with open arms. Especially doc writers, as it sometimes considered unglamorous work.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I mentioned in Part I, I’ll be working on the <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/">Tomboy</a> documentation, and I sent an email to the list letting the developers know, and asking if there were any areas of the docs that also needed changes or updates. (The Tomboy mailing list is generating a 404 error when I try and click on my email which can be <a href="http://lists.beatniksoftware.com/pipermail/tomboy-list-beatniksoftware.com/2009-March/001052.html">found here</a>).</p>
<p>In a terminal, create a directory where you will to checkout the source code of the project too. GNOME uses Subversion, and will be moving to git in the future. The GNOME Wiki has a <a href="http://live.gnome.org/SVN">great page on using Subversion</a>. Move to the directory where you want the source code, and per the GNOME SVN wiki page, checkout the project:</p>
<p><code>svn co http://svn.gnome.org/svn/[module]/trunk [module]</code></p>
<p>For Tomboy, I would do:</p>
<p><code>&lt;br /&gt; svn co http://svn.gnome.org/svn/tomboy/trunk tomboy</code></p>
<p>The Tomboy source code is now checked out to the “tomboy” directory in the directory I’m currently in. For the purpose of this example, we will assume you checked out the source code to $/home/source/tomboy</p>
<p>Now it’s time to find some documentation that needs updating. Good sources to find documentation updates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects’s Bugzilla</li>
<li>Reviewing the projects current documentation</li>
<li>Project’s release announcement of new features</li>
<li>Mailing list</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend starting by doing a query in the project’s Bugzilla (bug tracker) and see if any users have filed bugs or requests against the project’s existing documentation.</p>
<p>Log in to <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">GNOME Bugzilla</a>, and click the “<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi">Browse</a>” button in the top menu. On the Browse page, click on the drop down menu next to “Browse:” and click on the project you want to view, and “Show product”. You will be taken to the project’s Bugzilla page, which provides an overview of the number of bugs, type, and severity, among other information.</p>
<p>In the search box towards the top, you will see “project:Tomboy” already entered (or the project you chose), after that type documentation and hit search. The results will show any bugs that have a keyword of documentation, and you can browse through any open bugs to see if there are any changes that need to be added to the project’s documentation.</p>
<p>You will want to keep notes of any bugs you come across, or changes and updates the documentation file needs. Ironically, Tomboy is a great tool for this, and even supports the ability to drag and drop a GNOME Bugzilla link from your browser into Tomboy and converts it to an easy to use link.</p>
<p>I also recommend reviewing the project’s current documentation. Open the application, and hit F1 to bring up the help in the GNOME Help Browser (Yelp). With GNOME being on a 6 month release cycle, it may be possible that new features were added without being documented, which is why it’s also helpful to see if there was a Release announcement that outlines those new features.</p>
<p>Review the sections in the documentation, and compare to the behavior of the application. Do they match? If not, it might be useful to ask the developers in IRC or on the mailing list to double check, and make a note that the documentation needs to be updated to reflect those changes. This process can be time intensive, which is why you may want to start working on documentation with an application you’ve used and are familiar with.</p>
<p>If you introduced yourself on the project’s mailing list, the community members may have pointed out some areas that need updates as well.</p>
<p>Hopefully this has helped in getting you ready to (finally!) update the documentation. In Part III, I’ll cover updating the documentation’s Docboox / XML file and submitting your changes to the project.</p>

            <description>It’s been just over a year since I submitted my first patch to GNOME, for updated Tomboy documentation.
In that time, Shaun McCance of the GNOME Documentation team has been doing a lot of work to make it easier to get involved with the GNOME docs team.
Though Shaun is trying to make it easier to see which projects might need help with documentation updates, it’s still kind of overwhelming to try and figure out where to get started, especially as some of the information on the GNOME Docs team is outdated.</description>

<p>In that time, Shaun McCance of the GNOME Documentation team has been doing a lot of work to make it easier to get involved with the GNOME docs team.</p>
<p>Though Shaun is trying to make it easier to see which projects might need help with documentation updates, it’s still kind of overwhelming to try and figure out where to get started, especially as some of the information on the GNOME Docs team is outdated.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Join">Docs Team page</a> on the GNOME wiki is a great place to start. Let’s take a look at a number of the steps it lays out, and I’ll try out point out where, in my opinion, some of the important steps lay and additional tools available, such as Pulse.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 &amp; 2</strong>: Join the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-doc-list">mailing list</a> and IRC, as it refers to.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 &amp; 4</strong>: Choose a project and document to work on. First, you should choose a project that interests you, and that you may know a little about. Here is a quote from Shaun McCance to the GNOME Docs mailing list on 5/8/08:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My general recommendation to new writers is to pick</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>an application manual for something you use frequently.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s easier to write documentation for an application</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you’re familiar with. Smaller manuals will allow you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to go through the entire writing process and actually</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>finish something. Finishing things feels nice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The good news is that this is one area Shaun is making easier with the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/pulse/web/">Pulse</a> project. Pulse isn’t officially released yet, and is run manually by Shaun. Pulse tracks all of the software in GNOME, including documentation and translations.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-doc-list/2009-January/msg00028.html">Shaun sent an email</a> to the GNOME Docs list that helps understand this process better, especially as it relates the GNOME 2.26 process, and with some updated steps that aren’t covered in the wiki:</p>
<p>When looking for documentation to work on, you can use Pulse to help sort:</p>
<p>Use Pulse to view all GNOME 2.26 documentation: [http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/pulse/web/set/gnome-2-26-desktop#documents</p>
<p>]<a href="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/pulse/web/set/gnome-2-26-desktop#documents">5</a></p>
<p>Pulse can show which docs don’t have a specific individual as a maintainer, and will display GDP (GNOME Documentation Project) if it doesn’t. It’s recommended to start with a document maintained by the GDP to work on. Follow this link: <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/pulse/web/team/userdocs#documents">http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/pulse/web/team/userdocs#documents</a> and click on “Maintainer”. That shows the list of all projects maintained by the GDP. One of the advantages of working on a document maintained by the GDP is once your documentation move to the final state, the GNOME Docs team can commit the changes for you, as they are pre-approved with the maintainers of that project.</p>
<p>For my example though, wanting to update the Tomboy docs that I worked on a year ago, Tomboy is not maintained by the GDP. That’s ok – I’ve worked with one of the lead developers before, and I let him know in IRC that I was going to being working on documentation.</p>
<p>Going back to the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/pulse/web/set/gnome-2-26-desktop#documents">Pulse list of documents</a>, and clicking all, I then will choose and click on Tomboy.</p>
<p>Looking at the upper right hand corner of the Tomboy page in pulse, you will see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release Info</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Status:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>None</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Familiarize yourself with the Status definitions that Pulse will display: <a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/StatusTracking">http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/StatusTracking</a></p>
<p>None – great! This is the document I’ll start working on as no one has started working on it yet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Going back to the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Join">GNOME Docs Wiki</a>, step 5 is familiarizing yourself with the <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gdp-style-guide/2.26/">GNOME Style Guide</a>.</p>
<p>The sections I found most useful, was <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gdp-style-guide/2.26/fundamentals.html.en">Chapter 1, Fundamental Concepts</a>, especially the sections on Tone and the Golden Rules. <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gdp-style-guide/stable/gui-1.html.en">Chapter 7, Writing for GUIs</a>, is good to cover as well.</p>
<p>When it comes to writing Docbook though, the best advice I can give is to jump in to a document – you’ll quickly learn the syntax with or without prior programming experience. I have zero programming experience outside of some very basic HTML , and by looking at a couple of different pieces of GNOME documentation, was able to write the Foresight User Guide in Docbook.</p>
<p><strong>Steps 6 &amp; 7</strong>: Create accounts in <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">GNOME Bugzilla</a> and the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/action/login/DocumentationProject/Join?action=login">GNOME Wiki</a> (aka live.gnome.org).</p>
<p>The only other advice I can give, especially as it relates to IRC and the mailing list, is to drop a note and introduce yourself, and let the community know you want to help out. All of this might sound complicated, but instead of spending hours wading through all of the documentation and webpages available (some of it really out of date), I think if you read the above steps it will start to make sense (at least it did for me!)</p>
<p>In Part 2, I’ll cover my experience in some of the basics around using SVN to check out a project, updating the status and the documentation, and submitting a patch.</p>

            <description>It’s been just over a year since we rolled out the new Foresight website, which is written in HTML.
After some on and off debate, we’ve made the decision to switch to a CMS (which makes it much easier to get volunteers involved), and as of last night we’ve picked Joomla over Drupal.
We’ve set up our appliance on rBuilder, and we’re looking for help in building and maintaining the appliance, and even more important in designing a Joomla template for the look and feel of the new Foresightlinux.</description>

            <description>While the march to Foresight 2.1 continues to improve Foresight, one area that needs help, and is easy for a new contributor to jump into, is fixing current issues in Foresight.
While Foresight 2.1 will focus on a number of things to make Foresight even easier to use, such as improving boot up speed, printing, and installing packages, we would also like to fix as many bugs as we can.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While the march to Foresight 2.1 continues to improve Foresight, one area that needs help, and is easy for a new contributor to jump into, is fixing current issues in Foresight.</p>
<p>While Foresight 2.1 will focus on a number of things to make Foresight even easier to use, such as improving boot up speed, printing, and installing packages, we would also like to fix as many bugs as we can.</p>
<p>A quick look at <a href="https://issues.foresightlinux.org">Foresight’s issue tracker, JIRA</a>, shows the following:</p>
<p>637 total open issues (or 34% of all issues ever filed in JIRA)</p>
<p>In progress: 40 (2%)</p>
<p>Reopened: 15 (1%)</p>
<p>Needs QA: 120 (6%)</p>
<p>Blocker: 6 (1%)</p>
<p>Critical: 25 (3%)</p>
<p>Major: 77 (10%)</p>
<p>Normal: 572 (77%)</p>
<p>Minor: 55 (7%)</p>
<p>Trivial: 12 (2%)</p>
<p>By assignees:</p>
<p>Distro: 234 (31%)</p>
<p>Packagers: 123 (16%)</p>
<p>Ken VanDine 174 (23%)</p>
<p>Antonio Meireles 93 (12%)</p>
<p>Issues assigned to Distro need to be triaged and assigned. One other thing to note, is just because an issue is assigned to someone, doesn’t mean you can’t work on it! Issues are typically assigned to developers who we know can fix it, and we default to them.</p>
<p>We need your help! Out of the open issues, can you confirm it’s a bug? Try and re-create what happened to the user and comment on the issue if you can or can’t. Can you package? Jump in and browse package requests and build it! I’ll be triaging bugs over the holiday break, and if we can knock out a bunch of them prior to our 2.1 release, we can continue to make Foresight even better.</p>
<p>Want to learn more? Here are our wiki pages on <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/teams/HowTo+report+an+Issue+and+JIRA+Overview">using JIRA</a> and <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/teams/HowTo+Triage+Bugs+in+JIRA">triaging issues in Foresight</a>.</p>

            <description>Fringe is my new favorite TV show of the season, with Life on Mars being a close second. Fringe, created by JJ Abrams of Alias, Lost and Cloverfield fame, is to me, the X-Files meets Lost. (Which probably explains why I love it so much).
Fringe is roughly half way through it’s first season, and most of the episodes have been standalone and self contained to introduce the new viewer to the characters and over arching storyline.</description>

<p>Fringe is roughly half way through it’s first season, and most of the episodes have been standalone and self contained to introduce the new viewer to the characters and over arching storyline. Now it’s just starting to get good, as the over arching storyline is coming into focus, and we’re getting hints of what’s to come. And of course it left us for the next month on a big cliffhanger!</p>
<p>One of the many mysteries we’ve been introduced to, in addition to “The Pattern”, is a gentleman called “The Observer” whom we met in one episode. Now <a href="http://www.youtube.com/fox">Fox has released on their YouTube channel</a> clips of all the easter eggs of every episode on where The Observer is hidden, and I know I missed picking him out in most of them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fringetelevision.com/2008/12/observer-catch-him-if-you-can.html">Fringe Television has edited all the clips together</a>:</p>
<p>If you’re not watching Fringe, you should be. And how can you not love the fact they tell you before each commercial break when the show is coming back (60 or 90 seconds). Great for DVR users!</p>

            <description>In the immortal words of Goose from Top Gun: “Where’d whooooo go?”
I took the last 6 weeks to disappear as I started a new job, working in my home office. I owe the Foresight community an apology, as I should have given some warning. (Though I did let Ken and Antonio know).
What started as a one week sabbatical from the internet between jobs stretched out, as I was traveling 3 of the 4 first four weeks of the new job, and working in a home office requires a high level of focus.</description>

<p>I took the last 6 weeks to disappear as I started a new job, working in my home office. I owe the Foresight community an apology, as I should have given some warning. (Though I did let Ken and Antonio know).</p>
<p>What started as a one week sabbatical from the internet between jobs stretched out, as I was traveling 3 of the 4 first four weeks of the new job, and working in a home office requires a high level of focus. Add to that meeting new people, figuring out what you’re doing and who does what, I needed to step back for a bit from Foresight. I shut down IRC and IM so I could minimize distractions while working at home. It seems to have helped – I think I’ve found a rhythm and schedule that’s working.</p>
<p>I’ve been popping back in to IRC this week, and browsing through the commits and JIRA issues trying to get back up to speed. It’s amazing how much is going on in just the short period I was away.</p>
<p>Again, I apologize for not having been around, but the good news is I’m working my way back, and looking forward to helping take Foresight to the next level.</p>

            <description>If you live in the U.S., today is the day. After almost 2 years of campaigning and listening to the candidates, it’s our turn as citizens to make our decisions and vote for our candidates.
I voted an hour ago – and the turnout was higher than 4 years ago, and I live in the state with the highest percentage of registered voters and those who vote. We had more voting booths than I’ve seen in 10 years of living here.</description>

<p>I voted an hour ago – and the turnout was higher than 4 years ago, and I live in the state with the highest percentage of registered voters and those who vote. We had more voting booths than I’ve seen in 10 years of living here.</p>
<p>The best part? In Minnesota you can register to vote on election day, and vote. There were 6 people registering to vote, all, I would guess, under the age of 25. That’s what it’s about. For years the younger demographic has had the lowest turnout – I hope what I saw wasn’t just a fluke, and the young voters turn out today, and keep voting for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Please vote today. Every vote <em>does</em> make a difference.</p>

            <title>Foresight Packages</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2008/09/foresight-packages/</link>
            <pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2008 14:36:21 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2008/09/foresight-packages/</guid>
            <description>We are getting ready to release Foresight GNOME edition in the next week, once GNOME 2.24 is out.
Foresight is a rolling release distro – our packages are almost always up to date, and we keep them up to date, unlike most distributions that have 2 big releases a year, which is when they update packages.
Being a rolling release, this means that a Foresight “release” is just a snapshot in time of what is available in the repository.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are getting ready to release Foresight GNOME edition in the next week, once GNOME 2.24 is out.</p>
<p>Foresight is a rolling release distro – our packages are almost always up to date, and we keep them up to date, unlike most distributions that have 2 big releases a year, which is when they update packages.</p>
<p>Being a rolling release, this means that a Foresight “release” is just a snapshot in time of what is available in the repository.</p>
<p>With a big release coming up, how can you help? I’m glad you asked!</p>
<p>We have over 100 issues in our issue tracker (JIRA), of package requests that are complete, but need testing before we send them to the stable branch of Foresight.</p>
<p>To do a search in JIRA:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://issues.foresightlinux.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa">Click here to go to the Foresight issue tracker</a></li>
<li>Click on Find Issues under the Foresight logo, third from the left.</li>
<li>Under Project, select “Foresight Linux”</li>
<li>Under Issue Type, select “Package Requests”</li>
<li>Now scroll down, and under Issue Attributes and Status select “Needs QA”</li>
<li>Click View, and all the package requests that have been built and need testing will appear</li>
</ol>
<p>Then do a couple of things:</p>
<p>Make sure the package hasn’t been promoted to fl:2 already:</p>
<p><code>sudo conary rq packagename=@fl:2</code></p>
<p>If it hasn’t, make sure it’s not in the QA branch:</p>
<p><code>&lt;br /&gt; sudo conary rq packagename=@fl:2-qa</code></p>
<p>If it’s in QA, install it:</p>
<p><code>&lt;br /&gt; sudo conary update packagename=@fl:2-qa</code></p>
<p>And test it!</p>
<p>It’s possible it might have been built and needs to be promoted from fl:2-devel, and tested:</p>
<p><code>sudo conary rq packagename=@fl:2-devel</code></p>
<p><code>sudo conary update packagename=@fl:2-devel</code></p>
<p>In both cases, after testing, please comment on the Issue in JIRA whether the package worked or not, or any other relevant information, for example if it’s missing a .desktop file or menu entry.</p>
<p>That’s it! The QA team and I watch all bug reports via email or the the #foresight-qa and #foresight-alerts channels on Freenode IRC. From there we’ll make sure it gets added to the groups and promoted to the stable branch.</p>
<p>Happy testing, and thank you for the help! Let’s see how many packages we can test in the next few days before Foresight 2.0.5 is released.</p>

            <description>Gregory Mcdonald, most famous for being the author of the Fletch series, has died at age 71 from cancer.
I’m not a big mystery reader, but due to Kevin Smith‘s praise for McDonald’s dialogue in his novels, I picked up one or two of his books, and then quickly bought them all a number of years ago.
You thought the Fletch movies (well, at least the first one) were funny? Each and every one of these books will have you chuckling and laughing out loud at some point, and the mysteries weren’t half bad either.</description>

            <description>Foresight Bug Week wrapped up yesterday. I was pretty excited as it seemed we touched a number of issues. Upon further review, we still have a lot of work to do!
Some stats on the last 9 days of working on the issues (hope the formatting works):
9/1/2008 9/8/2008 Net Change
Total issues: 1644 1661 17
Open issues: 597 546 -51
In progress: 19 26 7
Resolved: 578 614 36</description>

<p>Minor: 57 53 -4</p>
<p>Trivial: 9 10 1</p>
<p>I’m happy to report that Package Requests, which make up about 20% of all issues in JIRA, have been assigned to the new Packagers ID, making it easy for our crack team of packaging experts to search for stuff to do. (Which I blogged about last week).</p>
<p>I personally spent some time porting packages from the fl:1 repo and user contributed repos to Foresight, and closed those package requests. (It’s so much easier when someone has already written the recipe for me!)</p>
<p>What the stats above don’t show is the number of total issues touched, which a report I ran in JIRA puts at 275 (about 30% of all issues in JIRA, both opened and closed). This includes linking duplicates, commenting on bugs if more information is needed, etc. At the end of the day, 5% of all bugs (86) were closed and / or resolved last week, which is a good start.</p>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<p>Out of the open issues, 30% (191) remain assigned to Distro – which means they need to be assigned to a developer to be addressed. Issues needing QA – which means the packages need to be tested, is 7% (116). We also have 19% (123) open package requests assigned to the Packagers ID. Poor Ken (138) and doniphon (82) have the most issues assigned to them, so give ’em a hand and help them out! Test some packages that need QA, and comment on the issue, or if you have time, package some applications that our users have requested.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning of a more regular QA / Bug Triaging process. It was a good first step, and thank you to everyone who lent a hand last week to help out, and I look forward to more help in the future.</p>

            <description>I was traveling in Los Angeles when Kelly got a bit of a scare last week.
Jack was running around upstairs, ran into the bathroom, and he slid on the linoleum right into the shower door.
With a cut on his head bleeding profusely, I think Zoe was more scared than Jack was. (Zoe seems to have rolled a high D20 for empathy when she was born).
Kelly rushed them to the emergency room, where they numbed Jack and gave him 6 stitches.</description>

<p>Kelly rushed them to the emergency room, where they numbed Jack and gave him 6 stitches. The ER nurses were amazed that after 12 years with 3 children, this was our first visit to the ER.</p>
<p>Jack’s doing well – since he can’t see the cut, it doesn’t bother him at all. Surprisingly, the nurses thought it won’t scar, and if it does, it will be very small and almost unnoticeable. He’ll get the stitches out later this week.</p>
<p>I miss all the fun when I’m off traveling for work.</p>

            <description>In no particular order:
 Airports &amp;amp; airport security. Food courts and choices at airports, especially as I think they over charge. (Is their rent that expensive?) Airplanes. Being crammed into a small seat with no legroom for ~4 hours, I always seem to hurt my shoulder somehow twisting around. Being out of the loop on the outside world. I find when I travel, and work across the country, between being busy in the office, and then dinners with co-workers, I miss the news on TV and the internet.</description>

            <title>Foresight Bug Week</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2008/09/foresight-bug-week/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2008 18:45:11 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>Foresight Bug Week kicked off Sunday, and we’re off to a good start.
As I mentioned in my last bug week post, Foresight has just under 600 issues open in some status or another. (Issues can be improvements, tasks, bugs or package requests).
In the first two days:
 15% of all open issues have been touched (about 90) 34, or just over 33% of those touched, were marked as resolved or fixed 56 were triaged and assigned  Out of the 56 that were triaged, the majority of them were package requests that moved from fl:2-devel to fl:2-qa for testing.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Foresight Bug Week kicked off Sunday, and we’re off to a good start.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=1027">last bug week post</a>, Foresight has just under 600 issues open in some status or another. (Issues can be improvements, tasks, bugs or package requests).</p>
<p>In the first two days:</p>
<ul>
<li>15% of all open issues have been touched (about 90)</li>
<li>34, or just over 33% of those touched, were marked as resolved or fixed</li>
<li>56 were triaged and assigned</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of the 56 that were triaged, the majority of them were package requests that moved from fl:2-devel to fl:2-qa for testing. This means after some testing, these can be promoted to Foresight 2 and closed as well! You can easily search for issues assigned to Foresight QA Team to see which packages need testing.</p>
<p>The other major change to Foresight’s issue tracker, JIRA, was that I created a new generic user, Packagers. Foresight’s JIRA has two generic users – <em>Distro</em> (jira-distro), which all issues are assigned to by default (which makes it easy to triage), and now <em>Packagers</em> (jira-packagers). This way, Foresight contributors who want to help out and create packages, can easily search by this user to see what package requests are outstanding. Most package requests still need to be triaged and assigned to <em>Packagers</em>.</p>
<p>In creating the Packagers user, I realized this weekend that we both of those users use a private mailing list we created. A number of core developers are subscribed to this list, and all issues created in JIRA are automatically emailed to this list. The same is true for the Packagers list, though it only emails those issues assigned to the <em>Packagers</em> user. If you would like to be added to either the JIRA mailing list (high volume) or Packagers mailing list, please drop me an email at pcutler at foresightlinux dot org and I will add you. This makes it easy to keep up in real time on JIRA activity if you so choose.</p>
<p>How you can help during Foresight Bug Week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join the Foresight QA team! Add your name to the list on the <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/teams/Quality+Assurance">QA space in the wiki</a>, and read through the QA documentation.</li>
<li>Triage, triage, triage! Are issues assigned to the right developer? Including package requests to Packagers. For a list of what developers should be assigned certain issues, take a look at the <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/teams/HowTo+Triage+Bugs+in+JIRA">Foresight QA triaging wiki page</a>. Is the issue assigned to the right person, is the component correct (for example I just fixed an issue that was assigned to the PackageKit component, but it was a Package request), is the serverity correct?</li>
<li>Test packages! Once a package request has been made, a few different things can happen. The packager might have built it and committed it to their personal repo, as they may not have access yet to Foresight’s repo. Install it and test it! Maybe the packager only could build it for x86, and not x86_64. Check out the recipe, and build it against both arches. (Give the original packager credit in the recipe file and bug report). Commit it to Foresight’s 2-devel repo or your personal repo and update the issue accordingly. When it’s ready to be tested, make sure it’s assigned to the Foresight QA team. Once it’s tested, it’s assigned to Ken to promote to fl:2.</li>
<li>Confirm bugs. Can you reproduce it? Comment on the issue with your findings. Check upstream – almost all packages will have their own issue tracker, and search to see if it’s been reported. If so, link to it in the Foresight issue tracker. Good story – Banshee has a bug that the first time you run it, it won’t run from the menu, only the terminal. I searched for about 15-20 minutes in Banshee’s bugzilla, but couldn’t find it, so created a bug in Banshee’s bugzilla and linked to Foresight’s issue and forums, as well as an Ubuntu forum post confirming the bug. Sure enough, it was closed almost right away in Banshee’s bugzilla as a duplicate, I just hadn’t searched hard enough. I linked to it, and within hours Ken applied the patch in Banshee’s bugzilla, and Foresight’s Banshee is now fixed. And the issue is closed!</li>
<li>Can you write code? We have lots of improvements filed, from Extlinux boot themes (<a href="https://issues.foresightlinux.org/browse/FL-1532">FL-1532</a>) to adding Encryption / LUKS support (<a href="https://issues.foresightlinux.org/browse/FL-313">FL-313</a>) to <a href="https://issues.foresightlinux.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&amp;mode=hide&amp;pid=10000&amp;sorter/order=DESC&amp;sorter/field=priority&amp;resolution=-1&amp;component=10040">PackageKit improvements</a>. While Ken and doniphon may do the majority of Foresight development, it doesn’t have to be this way, and I know for a fact they would love more volunteers.</li>
<li>Need help or have a question? Ask! Join the QA team in #foresight-qa on Freenode IRC. We won’t bite, I promise.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we continue to improve Foresight’s JIRA, my goal in the future is to publish bug stats bi-weekly. From there, I can better use JIRA’s features and build a roadmap to document how we will continue to improve Foresight.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank everyone who has helped out so far this week in lending a hand. A special shout out to pscott, zodman and jayson_r. Pscott for the cool IRC bot that is talking to JIRA, zodman for a number of recipes I was able to cook in x86_64 and get in to Foresight, and Jayson has dived right in and helped triage. I will be traveling the next two days, but will be back Thursday to help with more issues!</p>

            <description>It’s been way too long since we had a formalized bug hunt week for Foresight.
Worry no more, it’s next week! Starting next Sunday, August 31, through Saturday, September 6th we will be hunting down bugs, tasks and improvements to make Foresight better.
Here are some current statistics from JIRA, Foresight’s issue tracker:
 Total issues in Foresight: 1,644 Open issues: 597 (36%) In progress: 19 (1%) Resolved: 578 (35%) Closed: 322 (20%) Needs QA: 106 (6%)  Open Issues (By Priority)</description>

<p>Worry no more, it’s next week! Starting next Sunday, August 31, through Saturday, September 6th we will be hunting down bugs, tasks and improvements to make Foresight better.</p>
<p>Here are some <a href="https://issues.foresightlinux.org/browse/FL?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:openissues-panel">current statistics from JIRA</a>, Foresight’s issue tracker:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total issues in Foresight: 1,644</li>
<li>Open issues: 597 (36%)</li>
<li>In progress: 19 (1%)</li>
<li>Resolved: 578 (35%)</li>
<li>Closed: 322 (20%)</li>
<li>Needs QA: 106 (6%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Open Issues (By Priority)</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocker: 2</li>
<li>Critical: 22 [3%]</li>
<li>Major: 66 [10%]</li>
<li>Normal: 505 [76%]</li>
<li>Minor: 57 [9%]</li>
<li>Trivial: 9 [1%]</li>
</ul>
<p>57% of all open issues are assigned to Distro – which means they haven’t been triaged or assigned yet!</p>
<p>The goal of bug hunt is threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify the issue. Test it out. Does it exist? Can you confirm it? If so, then we need to get it assigned.</li>
<li>Fix the bugs! Though Ken and doniphon might be the largest contributors to Foresight, they are willing to help out and teach as well. There are a lot of things a new contributor can do – update packages, write patches to fix bugs, test out patches from upstream to see if it fixes the issue (and check with upstream to see if other users of other distros have filed a similar bug report).</li>
<li>Think like an end user. Sometimes it’s hard to see the forest for the trees when you use Foresight every day and get used to it’s quirks. But if you were a new user, whether it’s new to Linux or new to Foresight, what isn’t working, and should be? The goal of hunting down and fixing bugs is to make the best distribution we can.</li>
</ol>
<p>The bug hunt will fall over a holiday weekend for our USA users. This is both good and bad – maybe you have some extra time available on the holiday to help out. The bug hunt will run all week though – if you need more information, please ping me. We will be hanging out in #foresight-qa on Freenode IRC. <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/teams/Quality+Assurance">More information is available on the wiki</a>, including who’s willing to help, and how to use JIRA.</p>

            <description>It’s been over a year (a year!) since my last post about writing documentation for Foresight. In that time, we’ve shipped Foresight 2.0, and the Getting Started with Foresight User Guide has frequently been met with great feedback when Foresight is reviewed.
I’ve kept up with a few minor updates and edits to keep it fresh, but now it’s time to start planning some major updates. In no particular, I want to focus on:</description>

In that time, we’ve shipped Foresight 2.0, and the Getting Started with Foresight User Guide has frequently been met with great feedback when Foresight is reviewed.</p>
<p>I’ve kept up with a few minor updates and edits to keep it fresh, but now it’s time to start planning some major updates. In no particular, I want to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://issues.foresightlinux.com/browse/FL-1598">Banshee re-write</a>. Now that Banshee is at 1.2, the screenshots need to be updated to it’s new look, and an overview of it’s new features, including video, podcasts, Last.fm integration and internet radio.</li>
<li><a href="http://">Installing Foresight</a>. <a href="http://jaysonrowe.wordpress.com/">Jayson</a> was kind enough to attach some documentation and screenshots, but I didn’t find the time to incorporate them. (Hint, hint Jayson)</li>
<li><a href="http://issues.foresightlinux.com/browse/FL-408">Add a section on Liferea</a>. Write a section on Foresight’s default feedreader. Robin Groves has posted a first draft on the wiki that I need to review and edit.</li>
<li>Using GNOME-DO. As the first distribution to ship GNOME-DO, it’s a very powerful application, and new users probably need some help getting to know it.</li>
<li><a href="http://issues.foresightlinux.com/browse/FL-724">Expand the section on using PackageKit</a>. Some of the icons need to be updated as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>But more importantly, what do you think is missing from the User Guide? What does a new user need to know? I’d love to get some feedback. Foresight’s User Guide is located in <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/hg/foresight-user-guide-2/">Foresight’s Mercurial repository</a>. I’m also open to any help anyone wants to contribute! If you need help in checking it out or submitting a patch, please let me know.</p>

            <description>Foresight gets a nice review on the latest Linux Void Podcast (about 10 minutes in.) They touch on installing Foresight, the GNOME desktop, the User Guide, and Conary and it’s package management.
Towards the end of the review:
_
“People who want to start using Linux, and may not want to use Ubuntu, should check out Foresight”._
Overall, a good review.</description>

            <description>What a week last week turned out to be for Foresight!
In no particular order:
 The first newletter in months came out, and we enter year two of the newsletter. Hopefully I’m back in the swing of things and will get that released on time every month. Foresight 2.0.4 was released. And not just any release, a single CD install disc (the Foresight GNOME Lite Edition) is now available! It removes most languages, and is 32 bit only.</description>

<li><a href="http://lists.rpath.org/pipermail/foresight-distro/2008-July/000300.html">Foresight 2.0.4 was released</a>.

It removes most languages, and is 32 bit only. No more 2 CD installs, and this one uses the tar based installer, so installation should be under 10 minutes. And it’s easy to upgrade to the full version!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/releases/foresight-sfc.html">Foresight officially joined</a> the <a href="http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>. This is big for us – we now have the flexibility of being a non-profit organization. We can take donations, and use that money to help spread the word and market Foresight. It will help us get to more conferences, and create promotional material, whether that’s flyers or install discs to hand out. <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/donate.html">Donate today!</a> (I did!)</li>

<p>One last note, this week’s Foresight Council meeting has been moved up a day, from Friday to Thursday at 9 a.m. EST in #foresight-council on Freenode IRC.</p>

            <description>After months of slacking on my part, I am proud to announce a new issue of the Foresight Newsletter is out.
Now in to it’s second year, this issue gives an overview on the latest releases, including both 2.0.4 and 2.0, community news, a look back at the first Foresight User &amp;amp; Developer Conference, upcoming conferences, and other information. (Considering everything that’s happened, it could have been stuffed with news, but I really needed to push out a release and give myself a kick start).</description>

<p>Next month expected a more detailed in development section, and if my evil plan comes to life, this may even be the last month it’s released via the Foresight Wiki. (Cross your fingers!)</p>
<p>Enjoy the newsletter, and I’m always on the lookout for anyone who wants to lend a hand in writing for it as well.</p>

            <description>Just a reminder, I’ll be giving a talk on Foresight this Saturday in St. Paul at Penguins Unbound.
It will be more of an introduction to Foresight to existing Linux users (though I hope a few folks who don’t use Linux are there), and I’ll have some install discs to give out.
The meeting starts at 10:00 a.m., hit the link above for directions. See you there!</description>

            <description>In last week’s Focus meeting, the Focus council approved three new members to Foresight:
 Jordan Keyes (jkeyes0) Lance Haig (lancehaig) Tomas Forsman (Zinden)  I’d like to welcome them as official members to the community, and add a few words:
 Jordan is a relatively new user to Foresight, and has been involved with packaging. In addition to Eric Lake, Jordan has also participated in Foresight advocacy with his local LUG in Kentucky.</description>

<li>Jordan is a relatively new user to Foresight, and has been involved with packaging. In addition to Eric Lake, Jordan has also participated in Foresight advocacy with his local LUG in Kentucky.</li>
<li>Lance Haig, a <a href="http://bongo-project.org/Main_Page">Bongo</a> developer, got his start with Conary as the owner of the <a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/bongo/">Bongo appliance on rBuilder</a>. Lance has contributed packages to Foresight, notably virt-manager, a GUI for managing virtual machines with KVM.</li>
<li>Tomas aka Zinden, has been an active member of Foresight’s community in IRC and the forums, and has been an active advocate of Foresight in Sweden in helping Foresight gain new users, helping those users and managing a Swedish Foresight website.</li>

<p>What does it take to become an official Foresight member? Visit the <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/community/Becoming+a+Member">wiki page</a> for more, but we’re looking for contributors who have sustained participation within Foresight for a few months, whether it’s packaging, documentation, marketing or more. Benefits include a customized hostmask on Freenode IRC, @foresightlinux.org email address, and having your blog syndicated on <a href="http://planet.foresightlinux.org">Planet Foresight</a>. But best of all, it’s about the recognition of having helped Foresight and it’s community.</p>
<p>Think you have what it takes? <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/community/Request+Membership">Apply here</a>, and make sure your personal wiki page on the <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/dashboard.action">Foresight wiki</a> is updated with a list of your contributions and what you would like to accomplish in the future.</p>
<p>Once you’re a member, you can <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/community/Becoming+a+Developer">apply to be a developer</a>, and eventually gain commit access to the Foresight repositories.</p>

            <description>I’ve kicked off a conversation on the Foresight development mailing list today to talk about Quality Assurance.
At a high level, the question is what is the processes we need to put in place for testing to provide user’s with the best, most stable Linux OS?
Our focus continues to remain on the user experience. That phrase can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, but at the core, it remains about being a desktop experience that “just works”.</description>

<p>At a high level, the question is what is the processes we need to put in place for testing to provide user’s with the best, most stable Linux OS?</p>
<p>Our focus continues to remain on the user experience. That phrase can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, but at the core, it remains about being a desktop experience that “just works”. Users shouldn’t have to worry about updates breaking their system – ever.</p>
<p>The key to that is the beauty of Conary, and it’s ability to manage updates and dependencies for our users. Conary also lets us differentiate Foresight through rolling releases – we can update packages on the fly so users don’t have to wait on a 6 month release cycle. But that also means we have to have the ability to test Foresight, including new packages and the underlying infrastructure, before those updates are pushed to our users.</p>
<p>Do you have thoughts on how it should work? Want to get involved and help define that process or be a part of the QA team? Join the <a href="http://lists.rpath.org/mailman/listinfo/foresight-devel">development mailing list</a> and <a href="http://lists.rpath.org/pipermail/foresight-devel/2008-June/000545.html">contribute to the discussion</a>. Or join the <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/teams/Quality+Assurance">QA team</a> and <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/teams/HOWTO+switch+to+the+QA+version+of+Foresight+2.x">test the latest and greatest version of Foresight</a>.</p>
<p>More to come on how the QA process will work!</p>

            <description>With Google’s announcement this morning of Google Gadgets being available for Linux, Ken wasted no time in adding it to the QA branch tonight.
To install: sudo conary update google-gadgets (assuming you’re running the QA version of Foresight). If you’re running the standard version: sudo conary udpate google-gadgets=@fl:2-qa
Google Gadgets is meant to be run during an active session, so you won’t see a menu entry for them. Use GNOME-DO or Alt-F2 to run them, and type ggl-gtk, or add it to your sessions to automatically start on login in System -&amp;gt; Preferences -&amp;gt; Sessions (also by adding ggl-gtk).</description>

<p>Google Gadgets are the gadgets, such as stock quotes, clocks, calculators and more that are available on your iGoogle webpage, or desktop gadgets that Windows users can use, similar to widgets on a Mac OS X desktop, or similar in Vista.</p>
<p>They’re fun, but I don’t know if I’d keep them. When running, you’ll see the Google Gadgets icon in your panel (it’s the icon on the far left side):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/2552080461/" title="goog-gadgets-panel by silwenae, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Just browsing through fairly quickly, I added some to my desktop to take a screenshot (click through to Flickr for bigger sizes):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/2552080467/" title="google-gadgets by silwenae, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Running, left to right by row:</p>
<p>Row 1: Weather, Election News, Amazon Search, Youtube Search</p>
<p>Row 2: (Don’t remember)</p>
<p>Row 3: NASA Image of the Day, ESPN News, XBox Live Gamertag, Clock</p>
<p>Row 4: CPU Usage, Stock Ticker, Google Calendar</p>
<p>There are literally hundreds of different gadgets to choose from, including dozens of clocks, many different kinds of news tickers, and even games you can add right to your desktop, such as Pacman, Tetris or Bejeweled.</p>
<p>Thanks to Ken for quickly packaging. Eye candy is always fun.</p>

            <description>The Foresight Packaging Contest wrapped up last weekend, and the contest participants added almost 150 packages!
Now it’s time to test ’em! The packages live in the participant’s personal repositories, and we need to install them, make sure they work, have a menu entry, and then review which ones should be cloned to the Foresight repositories. We also will have some of the developers reviewing the recipes as well. Once we get this done, and we can start declaring some winners, and better yet, giving out some prizes!</description>

<p>We need help! Stop by on Freenode IRC in #foresight or #foresight-qa and look for me (pcutler) kenvandine, or pscott and lend a hand tomorrow, Wednesday, June 4th.</p>
<p>You might just find the next cool piece of software that you didn’t know was out there.</p>

            <description>The Foresight Council, aka Focus, which holds bi-weekly meetings on Fridays, is opening the meetings to all community members! This topic was discussed at yesterday’s Focus meeting, and all three council members were unanimous in supporting it.
Get a peek of what’s going on inside Foresight, from current development, future development, sub-teams goings on, and community updates.
Here are the meeting notes from yesterday’s meeting, and we’ll see you in #foresight-council on Freenode IRC at our next meeting on June 6th at 9 a.</description>

            <description>I updated my Linksys WRT-54GS (1.0) to dd-wrt last night, replacing Linksys’ firmware with the latest dd-wrt release, DD-WRT v24 (05/20/08) mega.
What a great experience. The documentation is complete, and has howto’s for all the different models that are compatible, and it was a snap following the step by step instructions.
I did a factory reset, uploaded the new firmware via Linksys’s web gui, another factory reset to load the firmware, and voila, open source firmware running on my Linksys router.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I updated my Linksys <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Linksys_WRT54G/GL/GS/GX">WRT-54GS</a> (1.0) to <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv3/index.php">dd-wrt</a> last night, replacing Linksys’ firmware with the latest dd-wrt release, DD-WRT v24 (05/20/08) mega.</p>

<p>The admin pages for managing the router are well designed, in both layout and functionality. And the funtionality – wow! So much you can do, from QOS, SSH, to boosting the range, or enabling all kinds of WPA protection that weren’t available via Linkys’s firmware.</p>
<p>I’ve just started playing with it, but so far I’m very impressed. I welcome my new open-source dd-wrt masters.</p>

            <description>Over the last week I’ve spent some time implementing the new wiki structure and content discussed at Foresight 20/20.
All the spaces have been consolidated into 6 major spaces (plus the newsletter):
 Community Development Documentation and Howtos FAQ Foresight 1.x Getting Involved  Content was moved around to the correct spaces. This has resulted in relative links need to be updated on some pages, and the wiki links now reflect the move to the new space, but this is minor in the scheme of things.</description>

<p>All the spaces have been consolidated into 6 major spaces (plus the newsletter):</p>
<ul>
<li>Community</li>
<li>Development</li>
<li>Documentation and Howtos</li>
<li>FAQ</li>
<li>Foresight 1.x</li>
<li>Getting Involved</li>
</ul>
<p>Content was moved around to the correct spaces. This has resulted in relative links need to be updated on some pages, and the wiki links now reflect the move to the new space, but this is minor in the scheme of things.</p>
<p>Some very old and outdated information, especially on pages that only had one or two sentences, was removed or consolidated into one page.</p>
<p>The major to-dos remaining include updating the Get Involved sub-team pages with team members and outstanding tasks where missing, moving some 1.4 development specific information in to the 1.x space, and the Community space in providing more information on current members, developers, and how to join. Additionally, I want the Community space to be transparent in to the workings of Foresight. I also need to add some missing Focus meeting minutes, and make sure I update that information more often as needed.</p>
<p>The beauty of a wiki is anyone can edit it – so jump in and help out!</p>

            <description>Thanks to zdz for posting a comment on my T61 Lockups post.
He was absolutely right – it was an Intel / xorg driver issue causing the lockups.
A big shout out to doniphon for updating and testing Xorg at the 20/20 Conference last week. I’m running the latest Xorg on my T61, and the lock-ups are gone!
And I’m still loving the T61. Great Linux support, good form factor, and a great value.</description>

            <description>One of the first sessions on Saturday was a discussion on defining the development process for Foresight. (Unfortunately this was a session I missed, but it sounded fairly technical anyway!)
Most developers have been committing packages to the 2-devel label (rather than :devel) and the decision was made to stick to 2-devel. Additionally, one big change is the concept of creating a new repository outside of Foresight for true development and big changes that are tested in this sandbox beore moving to fl:2-devel.</description>

<p>Most developers have been committing packages to the 2-devel label (rather than :devel) and the decision was made to stick to 2-devel. Additionally, one big change is the concept of creating a new repository outside of Foresight for true development and big changes that are tested in this sandbox beore moving to fl:2-devel. In my opinion, this is a great idea, as it’s fairly easy for users to install packages from the 2-devel label. (Epiphany is a great example – right now in 2-devel it’s based on Webkit – a few users have encountered errors based on the Webkit dependencies needed). This should make it better for users, as the chance to break their desktop will diminish.</p>
<p>Labels for these new sandboxes will be based on the JIRA issues that define what the work being done is.</p>
<p>For more details, <a href="https://issues.foresightlinux.org/browse/FP-7">see the JIRA issue discussing the new development process</a>.</p>

            <description>One of Sunday’s sessions / hackfests, was a discussion on how to re-organize the wiki. As many wiki’s become over time, the Foresight wiki has many pages which are now out of date, especially due to the transition to Foresight 2.0.
One of the comments that was shared by Stef on Saturday as it related to documentation during the community session (more on that in another recap post), was the goal of each tool.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of Sunday’s sessions / hackfests, was a discussion on <a href="https://issues.foresightlinux.org/browse/FP-20">how to re-organize the wiki</a>. As many wiki’s become over time, the <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/dashboard.action">Foresight wiki</a> has many pages which are now out of date, especially due to the transition to Foresight 2.0.</p>
<p>One of the comments that was shared by <a href="http://stefw.livejournal.com/">Stef</a> on Saturday as it related to documentation during the community session (more on that in another recap post), was the goal of each tool. Paraphrasing Stef, what I took away was:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org">Foresight website</a>: Permanent and official source of news and Foresight information</li>
<li>IRC: Live help (especially to quick and easy questions)</li>
<li><a href="http://forum.foresightlinux.org/index.php">Foresight forums</a>: More detailed help that can’t be done quickly in IRC, and user documentation such as tips and tricks and user generated help</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/dashboard.action">Foresight wiki</a>: Knowledge base</li>
</ul>
<p>Foresight uses Confluence for it’s wiki, which is quite powerful, but very different from MediaWiki, which many users are familiar with. Confluence uses the term “spaces” to divide different sections of the wiki. The landing page for the Foresight wiki lists the different spaces on the left, most recently edited pages on the upper right, and pages you follow (customizable by you) on the lower right hand side.</p>
<p>Today the landing page lists every space available. We agreed to display six spaces permanently on the landing page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common Questions (FAQ)</li>
<li>Using Foresight</li>
<li>Get Involved</li>
<li>Community</li>
<li>Development</li>
<li>Foresight 1.x</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common Questions</strong></p>
<p>Common Questions will be the home to the FAQ, and other user generated information such as tips and tricks that migrates from the Forums to the wiki. The goal is to have a meeting / hackfest once a month to go through content that should migrate.</p>
<p><strong>Using Foresight</strong></p>
<p>Home to the User Guide, and other permanent documentation for users about using Foresight on a day to day basis.</p>
<p><strong>Get Involved</strong></p>
<p>One of the major changes to the wiki. Today there are spaces dedicated to Development, Docs, QA, etc. There is a lot of overlap that each of those spaces has information for the user, as well as how to join a specific sub-team. We will consolidate this information for the sub-teams in Get Involved, and the other spaces become reference material / knowledge base without cluttering it up between these two areas.</p>
<p>A second, important feature of Get Involved, is to document a list of tasks or ways to get involved. <a href="http://linux-blog.org/">Derrick (aka Devnet)</a> shared some great information in Saturday’s Community discussion around this. It’s easy to have users join a team, but to truly have them involved, you have to share with them the goals and tasks of what needs to be done.</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong></p>
<p>Here is the knowledge base for what the Foresight Community is about. Different than the Get Involved section, this space lists Community news and events, such as upcoming conferences, Focus meeting notes and upcoming meetings, and how to become an official Foresight member and developer.</p>
<p><strong>Development</strong></p>
<p>This space is for developer documentation, including how to set up a build environment, creating packages, or migrating to the QA environment. This space shares the Foresight roadmap.</p>
<p><strong>Foresight 1.x</strong></p>
<p>One of the most in-depth discussions was regarding what to do with all the content that is now considered out of date that relates to Foresight 1.x. We don’t want to just delete that content, both for users or developers, as a large part of our user base is probably still running Foresight 1.x. Here we will be migrating all the wiki content that relates to Foresight 1.x, and archive it. At some point in the (far) future we will have to make a decision on long we keep it, but for now it’s important to have this information available to users, but it does need to be separate from Foresight 2.0.</p>
<p>Other changes to the wiki include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making other spaces that exist not display on the landing page, such as the Newsletter space</li>
<li>Maintenance including removing dead links</li>
<li>Deleting or consolidating information on older pages. (Our favorite example page of this is the <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/docs/HOWTO+Save+Energy">Howto Save Energy page</a>. We all got a good chuckle.)</li>
<li>Applying tags to as many pages as possible to make it easy for users to find content.</li>
<li>Updating older pages and creating pages that we need.</li>

<p>One thing I need to find is the Firefox searchlet devnet was talking about, to make it easy to search for content as well.</p>
<p>For a list of the full meeting notes (including pages marked for updating, deleting or creating), you can <a href="https://issues.foresightlinux.org/browse/FP-20">view the JIRA issue here</a>. Thanks to everyone who attended the session, it was a great discussion with concrete next steps. Now it’s time to make it happen!</p>

            <title>Foresight 20/20 Conference Recap</title>

            <description>The Foresight 20/20 conference wrapped up today in Raleigh, North Carolina.
With 29 registered conference attendees, I would estimate 25 or 26 showed up over the course of two days, which is fantastic attendance. Conferences like these are not only great at building relationships as you finally meet people face to face you’ve spoken to forever in IRC, but also add an energy that only comes from being in the same room with your fellow project members.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/marketing/Foresight+User+and+Developer+Conference">Foresight 20/20 conference</a> wrapped up today in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
<p>With 29 registered conference attendees, I would estimate 25 or 26 showed up over the course of two days, which is fantastic attendance. Conferences like these are not only great at building relationships as you finally meet people face to face you’ve spoken to forever in IRC, but also add an energy that only comes from being in the same room with your fellow project members.</p>
<p>Friday night was fairly informal as people arrived, all with different flight times. Most of the out of towners, including myself, had dinner at a Thai restaurant, then headed to the <a href="http://www.beerknurd.com/">Flying Saucer</a> in downtown Raleigh, just down the road from North Carolina State University. The Flying Saucer is a huge bar with a nice outdoor patio, and stocks over 100 different kinds of beer. You name it they probably have it (except for Pabst Blue Ribbon, which Ryan did try to order at one point). They also have a club you can join with a kiosk that helps you go on a journey of trying all the beers, with varying prizes the more you drink over time.</p>
<p>Saturday was the first day of the conference, and was kicked off by Ken VanDine giving his “State of the Vision” (his title!) address on the current state of Foresight, how we’re different, and where we’re headed. This was one of the few sessions actually recorded on a camcorder, so we’ll need to find a volunteer to edit and post the video. This was followed by Ken and Antonio sharing their goals for Foresight’s roadmap.</p>
<p>Saturday was the fairly structured day, with tracks including Community building, Development Process, Marketing, and QA Process. Each session was assigned a task in <a href="https://issues.foresightlinux.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&amp;mode=hide&amp;pid=10041&amp;sorter/order=DESC&amp;sorter/field=priority&amp;resolution=-1&amp;component=10125">JIRA</a>, and the meeting notes are available in JIRA. Over the next week, it’s my goal to write a post about each session, and recap what was discussed by project members.</p>
<p>Saturday evening we headed out for dinner as a large group, and back to the Flying Saucer for more beer.</p>
<p>Sunday was our unconference day, similar to a Barcamp. We kicked off the day with session recaps from Michael (Development Process), Paul Scott-Wilson (QA Process) and Kevin (Marketing). From there we quickly brainstormed what hackfests and sessions we’d like to see throughout the day, wrote them on a whiteboard and then each attendee put a tick mark next to the sessions he or she was interested in attending.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next week or so, it’s my goal to blog about the majority of the sessions and hackfests on Saturday and Sunday. These will include an overview of the session, goals, and action items to keep moving Foresight forward that were discussed. As mentioned above, each session was captured as an action item in JIRA, and I will link to the JIRA issue, and provide a recap.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who came, the first Foresight 20/20 Conference was a blast, and I look forward to many more.</p>

            <description>GNOME Do’s final project report has been released. GNOME Do was originally started as an academic project by a few students at the University of Pennsylvania.
I would like to direct you to page 13, where Foresight and Shuttle both receive mentions:
 Our most recent release was 0.4.2., released on April 15, 2008. GNOME Do now has packages in every major GNU/Linux distribution, and is even installed by default in Foresight Linux and a few others.</description>

pscott has spent a chunk of the day getting Foresight to run on his Asus EeePC – he’s booting Foresight from an external USB hard drive, and had to compile a custom madwifi driver to get wireless to work.</description>

<p>pscott has spent a chunk of the day getting Foresight to run on his Asus EeePC – he’s booting Foresight from an external USB hard drive, and had to compile a custom madwifi driver to get wireless to work. It runs well – fairly snappy, and according to him, comparable to the Xandros OS it ships with.</p>

            <description>My flight got in late last night, and Ken was kind enough to pick me up from the airport, where I met pscott and doniphon face to face for the first time.
After a snafu at the hotel (long story for a different time), we are hanging out at the rPath offices. Walk in to their office and you know exactly where you are, this is on the wall:</description>

            <description>My new T61 laptop is freezing, typically after 5-10 minutes of inactivity, but every once in a while I’m using it. It seems as if I’m actively using it, it won’t freeze up, but soon as I stop, within 5-10 minutes it just hard locks. I’ve used my T61 up to two hours without lock-ups, set it aside, and bam, frozen.
I’ve browsed through the /var/logs/messages file a number of times, but I don’t see anything in the file – just the reboot messages.</description>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://lists.rpath.org/pipermail/foresight-devel/2008-April/000531.html">browsed through the /var/logs/messages file</a> a number of times, but I don’t see anything in the file – just the reboot messages. I spent 3 hours last night running <a href="http://www.memtest86.com/">Memtest86</a>, and my memory passed all the tests. I also re-formatted and re-installed Foresight a second time. I can’t figure it out.</p>
<p>I would really hate to have to re-install Vista to see if it happens there too before calling Lenovo’s warranty service.</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>

            <description>This may only amuse me, but the number of searches on my blog for “ubuntu banshee 0.98.2” has skyrocketed in the last day or two since Banshee’s recent release.
Just another reason to use Foresight! Conary’s ability to write a recipe to create a package is easier than almost every distribution out there. This gives us the ability not only to add packages quickly, but to maintain Foresight as a rolling distribution.</description>

<p>Just another reason to use Foresight! Conary’s ability to write a recipe to create a package is easier than almost every distribution out there. This gives us the ability not only to add packages quickly, but to maintain Foresight as a rolling distribution. After testing packages, we can keep our distribution up to date without having to have two major releases a year like most distributions do today. Think 0.98.2 will be in Ubuntu? Think again! (Not that I’m trying to start a flame war with Ubuntu, we each have our pros and cons).</p>
<p>Even Aaron Bockover, Banshee’s lead developer <a href="http://abock.org/2008/03/26/banshee-and-the-second-alpha-rolls-along/#comment-149185">commented on his blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@trettle: First off, thanks! Ubuntu packages should be on their way, but its really up to those in the Ubuntu community to contribute the packaging. The Foresight guys always have packages available minutes after an upstream release, for instance. It would be nice to see someone do the same for Ubuntu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try Foresight today!</p>

            <description>Yes, I’m going to tease you.
Expect another big Foresight announcement in the next 48 hours. And no, it’s not an OEM deal.
But it’s still big.
Stay tuned, and free up your calendar for Sunday night!</description>

            <description>Banshee 0.98.2 is out! Read the release notes, and check out Planet Banshee for the developer’s comments on the new functionality.
What’s new? VIDEO. Yup, you read that right. Your favorite audio manager is now a full fledged media manager.
I’ve been using the Banshee Preview for a few weeks, and this latest release for almost a week, and it works great. Import your music or video, and watch it right in Banshee.</description>

<p>A big shout out to Will Farrington for writing the recipe, which I committed last night to the Foresight repositories. Search for <code>banshee-1</code> in PackageKit, or install via sudo conary update <code>banshee-1=@fl:2-qa</code> Enjoy!</p>
<p>(And thanks to the Banshee devs for giving me credit for helping write the release notes, but I really didn’t deserve it. I started ’em with a copy / paste of 0.98.1, and some other minor edits, but didn’t get a chance to really finish it). Gotta love the Foresight mention right in the release notes though!</p>

            <description>My uncle, who’s also my godfather, passed away recently, and unexpectedly gifted me with an inheritance. After a discussion with my wife, I decided to buy myself a new toy.
My current laptop (a Toshiba A135-S4467) is only a year old, but doesn’t support VT, and I wanted something slightly smaller and lighter. It’s had Foresight on it since day one, and I recently just upgraded it from 1 GB memory to 2GB, but resume and suspend has never worked on it.</description>

<p>My current laptop (a Toshiba A135-S4467) is only a year old, but doesn’t support VT, and I wanted something slightly smaller and lighter. It’s had Foresight on it since day one, and I recently just upgraded it from 1 GB memory to 2GB, but resume and suspend has never worked on it. (Thanks Toshiba). My wife’s laptop is about 4 years old, and my old laptop will make a nice upgrade for her. Once I peel the stickers off…</p>
<p>I did a little shopping around, but a number of Foresight developers have Thinkpads, and they just work. I had a little guilt buying from a Chinese company, but let’s be honest. They’re all made in China anyways. What really decided it for me, was the ability to support a company that offers Linux pre-installed, specifically SUSE.</p>
<p>After a quick run to Best Buy to look at screen sizes, I decided to buy a <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087&amp;current-category-id=F2F5363C71FA4D61B176AD5FB80FA5D8">14.1″ T61</a>online at Lenovo.com. Now it was time to place the order.</p>
<p>The buying experience was so-so. Finding the link on Lenovo’s Thinkpad page to the SUSE option was fairly well buried, and I finally found it on the bottom right of the page, way below the customization options for the different models prominently featured above. (Going back to their site this week, I don’t even see that link or any of the other information under the Special Offers).</p>
<p>To my disappointment, all of the processor options for the SUSE builds were a generation behind (T7400 – T7800). If I was going to buy a new laptop, I thought I might as well do it right, and get one of the new 45mm Penryn processors (T8100 – T9500). But no such luck, and I ended up having to customize one with Vista. I chose Vista Home Basic and as I’m going to immediately wipe it and put Foresight on it anyway. I also ordered less memory (1x1GB) and ordered 4GB (2x2GB) from Newegg, as it was much cheaper that way.</p>
<p>After purchasing it a week ago Sunday, Lenovo showed my ship date as Tuesday, April 8th. That was a little disappointing as their website said available in 1-2 weeks, and that was just over two weeks total. After a slight hiccup with my order being processed (Visa held it thinking it was fraud, more on that below), I got that fixed Monday, and on Tuesday Lenovo showed my status as starting to build the order. I was pleasantly surprised on Thursday, just 4 days later when I got the ship notice from Lenovo. So much for 1-2 weeks! Now that is under promising and over delivering. Of course, I chose the free ground shipping, so I still have a few days to go before it gets here. The waiting is killing me!</p>
<p>I ended up ordering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Core 2 Duo T9300</li>
<li>14.1″ WXGA+ monitor</li>
<li>Intel GMA X3100 Video Card</li>
<li>1 GB (1×1) PC5300 Memory (and 4GB from Newegg)</li>
<li>100GB 7200 RPM Hard Drive</li>
<li>PC Card Slot and Media Card Slot</li>
<li>Intel 4965 A/G/N Wireless</li>
<li>Integrated Bluetooth</li>
<li>9 Cell Lithium-Ion Battery</li>
</ul>
<p>I also ordered, in addition to the laptop and the memory, a Timbuk 2 messenger bag. After taking a few hours trying to decide and building my own, I went with the <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/limited-edition/blue-whimsy-limited-edition-laptop-messenger">Blue Whimsy Limited Edition.</a> (No wonder Visa thought there was some fraud going on, 3 quick purchases all online).</p>
<p>Good-bye Toshiba laptop, you’ve served me well. And thanks Uncle John, we’ll miss you.</p>

  A mixed review of Foresight. Liked some things, didn&amp;#8217;t like some others. Good to read to help maintain perpsective.

            <description>I’ve been in Los Angeles for most of the two weeks. I hate traveling, as I feel out of the loop on stuff, so trying to get caught up. A few others have posted some similar links, but here’s what’s going on in the world of Foresight:
 Shuttle’s KPC launched on Newegg a day or two ago. $209.99 with Foresight pre-installed. Foresight 2.0’s GNOME edition was released 8 days ago featuring GNOME 2.</description>

<ul>
<li>Shuttle’s KPC <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856101065">launched on Newegg</a> a day or two ago. $209.99 with Foresight pre-installed.</li>
<li><a href="http://foresightlinux.org/gnome.html">Foresight 2.0’s GNOME edition was released 8 days ago</a> featuring GNOME 2.22 and a complete re-design of Foresight’s base infrastructure. Amazingly fast installer, latest GNOME, and some new default settings. A few things left to tweak, but I’m so amazed by the progress Foresight has made in the last year since I started using it. <a href="http://foresightlinux.org/gnome.html">Download it</a> and / or <a href="http://foresightlinux.org/releases/2-0.html">read the release notes</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://forum.foresightlinux.org/index.php">Foresight Forums are live</a>! I’m very impressed by the number of people who have created accounts already, and the number of discussions going on. Big shout out to Stef for launching the appliance.</li>
<li>I booked my flight for the <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/marketing/Foresight+User+and+Developer+Conference">Foresight User and Developer Conference</a>. I’m very excited to see two of our UK devs coming over the pond to join us. Be there or be square!</li>
<li>Here’s a great interview with our fearless leader <a href="http://www.fsckin.com/2008/03/19/interview-with-ken-vandine-of-foresight-linux/">Ken VanDine at fsckin.com</a>.</li>
<li>Here’s a <a href="http://mklinuxos.blogspot.com/2008/03/news-foresight-linux-20-released.html">nice review of Foresight 2.0</a>. Love the User Guide shout out.</li>
<li>Here’s a <a href="http://www.distro-review.com/review-foresight-2">mixed review of Foresight</a>. The author liked the installation, User Guide, and had some valid concerns about PackageKit, Conary’s lack of metadata, and codec installation. Stuff I hope to work on this weekend. The author does not recommend Foresight at the end, and recommends Ubuntu to new users. I don’t have a problem with bad reviews – it’s good to maintain perspective and gives us developers goals to work towards to keep making Foresight better.</li>
<li><a href="http://live.gnome.org/Tasque">Tasque</a>, formerly Tasky, is now available in the Foresight repositories instead of my personal repo. It’s still in 2-qa for testing. Rock!</li>
<li>The <a href="http://abock.org/2008/03/13/banshee-10-alpha-1/">first alpha of the new Banshee</a> is also available for testing in 2-qa, available as banshee-1.</li>
<li>Audacity is <a href="http://www.rpath.com/rbuilder/repos/foresight/troveInfo?t=audacity">now available in 2-qa</a> for the first time in Foresight. GTK-1 apps are a pain to build packages for, and Ken is the man for getting this in. Time to start learning how to podcast!</li>
<li>ATI’s proprietary driver, <a href="http://www.rpath.com/rbuilder/repos/foresight/troveInfo?t=ati-fglrx">fglrx</a>, is available for testing in 2-devel for the first time in Foresight 2.0. I’m going to install and test it this weekend on my test box. I still need to write the documentation for installing that in the User Guide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of stuff going on! We still have bugs to fix, packages to add, and updates to documentation that need to be written. If you’ve ever wanted to contribute, now’s a great time. For more information ping me in IRC, pcutler on Freenode in #foresight.</p>

            <description>A major change from Foresight 1.x to 2.0 (Beta) is the removal of proprietary codecs, which are no longer installed by default.
Depending on where you live and the legality of the codecs, users can install MP3 and DVD support via sudo conary update group-codecs.
You, of course, assume all legal responsibility. 🙂</description>

            <description>Will Farrington was kind enough to write a recipe for an early look at the next generation of Banshee, which is an early alpha. I’ve been able to get the recipe to cook locally, but not on rMake, so it’s not available in the repos yet, but we’re working on it.
With the exception of two visual quirks that come and go, it’s running great. Last.fm / audioscrobbling works 10 times better than Banshee 0.</description>

I’ve been able to get the recipe to cook locally, but not on rMake, so it’s not available in the repos yet, but we’re working on it.</p>
<p>With the exception of two visual quirks that come and go, it’s running great. Last.fm / audioscrobbling works 10 times better than Banshee 0.13.2, and the new UI gives you the ability to view the browser on top or on the left. (The screenshot below is with the browser on the left).</p>
<p>Best of all, searching overall is much faster. It still has support for Smart Playlists and DAPs, and I’m going to test the DAP functionality overnight. (update – I didn’t read the Alpha notice that pops up every time you start it well enough – no DAP support or plugins yet!) I don’t see plugin support yet, but all I need right now is Last.fm.</p>
<p>Well done Banshee developers!</p>
<p>Banshee alpha running on Foresight 2.0 Beta 1:</p>

            <description>Here are just a few things going on in the world of Foresight recently:
 Tasky is packaged for FL:2. Get control of your to-do lists on your desktop, works with RTM. Cool, new app in development. The new Foresight website was released 3 days ago! Still a few bug fixes to go. And we’re looking for help on translations. A forum was picked for Foresight: SMF. Hopefully will deploy this month.</description>

<p>Shuttle Teams with Foresight Linux on $199 KPC</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>City of Industry, CA., MArch 4, 2008</p>
<p>Shuttle today announced that the newly launched $199 KPC will feature the Foresight Linux operating system. With an intuitive interface and user focused design, Foresight does away with the need for users to be familiar with Linux.</p>
<p>A host of the latest software is packaged with the operating system, giving users convenient and enjoyable access to music, photos, videos, documents, and the Internet. Even keeping up-to-date with the latest features and fixes is a simple process with the user friendly update button.</p>
<p>Foresight uses the revolutionary Conary® Package Manager developed by rPath and distributed as Open Source software under the terms of the Common Public License. With the Conary® Package Manager, the system updates only the specific files in packages which need to be updated so updating takes little time and bandwidth.</p>
<p>Shuttles KPC includes many software packages already installed, including the OpenOffice.org® office suite, the Firefox® web browser, the Pidgin instant messenger, the Banshee music player, the Totem movie player, the F-Spot photo organizer, and Compiz for 3D desktop effects. For more details visit: <a href="http://us.shuttle.com/kpc">http://us.shuttle.com/kpc</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re putting a lot of work making sure Foresight 2.0 is ready and polished as we are excited to introduce Foresight to new users who buy Shuttle’s KPC. A new addition to Shuttle’s family of SFF (small form factor PCs), the KPC features the ability to customize the look of the front of the computer, and features a 80 GB hard drive, Intel Graphics, 512 MB ram, and choice of Intel processors.</p>

            <description>Tasky is a new task management application for the GNOME desktop. Written by Boyd Timothy and Calvin Gaisford, Tasky features syncing with Remember the Milk, but doesn’t feature the ability to use RTM tags yet. Tasky is a great way to help implement and use Getting Things Done.
I went on the adventure last night of packaging Tasky for Foresight 2 in my personal repository on rBuilder, the first package I’ve added to my own repo.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/tasky/">Tasky</a> is a new task management application for the GNOME desktop. Written by <a href="http://boyd.musipal.com/2008/02/tasky-cracks-whip.html">Boyd Timothy</a> and <a href="http://calvinrg.blogspot.com/">Calvin Gaisford</a>, Tasky features syncing with <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a>, but doesn’t feature the ability to use RTM tags yet. Tasky is a great way to help implement and use <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">Getting Things Done</a>.</p>
<p>I went on the adventure last night of packaging Tasky for Foresight 2 in my personal repository on rBuilder, the first package I’ve added to my own repo. After some initial hiccups with my build setup, the light bulb finally went off and I think I’ve finally figured out Conary contexts after all this time. I can’t thank Ken enough for all his help last night, from figuring out my setup to troubleshooting the rMake logs on what dependencies Tasky was missing.</p>
<p>Building packages using <a href="http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary">Conary</a> is, on one hand, at times frustrating, but on the other hand, exhilarating when it finally works. And though I may say frustrating, I packaged up 4-5 Ubuntu .debs before I switched to Foresight a year ago, and Conary is still ten times easier (at least).</p>
<p>I started with my <a href="http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary:Recipe">recipe</a>, this is the final version:</p>
<p>`<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<h1 id="copyright-c-2007-paul-cutler-pcutler">Copyright (c) 2007 Paul Cutler <!-- raw HTML omitted --></h1>

<p>#<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When I first cooked it, I didn’t have any of the buildRequires listed. <a href="http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary:cvc_cook">cvc cook</a> kicked back the recommendations it had to add to buildRequires, and I added them. I was then given a changeset file I was able to install using Conary. And Tasky worked! The first time you run it, and choose RTM, it will open RTM in your browser, and ask you to authorize the application. After that, I had a Tasky icon on my panel, and opening Tasky I was presented with all my tasks that I’ve entered into RTM (which I need to update). Choosing the Foresight tag, I saw:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/2297654639/" title="Screenshot-Tasky by silwenae, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Very pleased with myself, the next step was to <a href="http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary:About_rMake">rMake</a> Tasky, and commit to my repo. However, rMake would fail. Ken showed me what to look for in the rMake log, and the Conary command to find the missing package and add to my buildRequires in the above recipe. This was the frustrating part, as it became trial and error. rMake would tell me I was missing a package, I’d figure out which one, and then rMake again (And usually pinging Ken for more help). After running rMake seven times and adding the missing dependencies, the 8th time worked, and Tasky was created by rMake in it’s chroot. The pride and excitement you feel when it works is quite the rush.</p>
<p>I then did a rMake commit, and now anyone can install Tasky for testing, and I committed x86 and x86_64 versions. From a command line in Foresight 2, type:</p>
<p><code>sudo conary update tasky=silwenae.rpath.org@fl:2-devel</code></p>
<p>Leave your feedback on how it works for you!</p>
<p>Tasky also features a Tomboy plugin, but I’m not an advanced enough developer to even think about how I would go about patching Tomboy to make it work. More information on the Tomboy patch and plugin <a href="http://boyd.musipal.com/2008/02/tasky-cracks-whip.html">at the bottom of Boyd’s blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to make sure my Tasks are up to date.</p>

            <description>Phoronix has another story up on the continued delay of the UT3 Linux client, ported by Ryan Gordon, aka icculus.
One sentenced in the story rubbed me the wrong way:
 Ryan Gordon, the one responsible for the Unreal Tournament Linux ports, has yet to provide the Linux gaming community with any status update or respond to our inquiries.
 I don’t understand how it is Ryan’s responsibility to provide an update.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Phoronix has <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=NjM2Mg">another story up</a> on the continued delay of the UT3 Linux client, ported by Ryan Gordon, aka <a href="http://www.icculus.org">icculus</a>.</p>
<p>One sentenced in the story rubbed me the wrong way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ryan Gordon, the one responsible for the Unreal Tournament Linux ports, has yet to provide the Linux gaming community with any status update or respond to our inquiries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t understand how it is Ryan’s responsibility to provide an update. It has already been covered multiple times that the Linux client is <a href="http://planetunreal.gamespy.com/fullstory.php?id=145570">hung up due to a legal issue</a> with some offending code in the game. We should be grateful Ryan clued us in originally to what the delay was. However, Ryan works for Epic as a contractor – he’s not an official employee, and he shouldn’t be the one responsible for updating the community. As it’s a legal issue, of course he’s not going to comment. The constant speculation and conspiracy theories have grown old quickly.</p>
<p>If someone wants an official quote, they should be talking to someone at Epic’s office, maybe Mark Rein. I subscribe to the UT3 mailing list, and the number of questions, comments and rampant speculation on this issue, as well as the the constant badgering of Ryan are counter-productive. If he could say something, he would.</p>
<p>I absolutely agree that it’s disappointing we don’t have an official statement from Epic one way or another if a Linux client will ever be released. As someone who’s an avid gamer on Linux, I’m disappointed I can’t play one of my favorite franchises. But leave Ryan out of it, he’s done everything he can.</p>

            <description>I’ve been remiss in recapping SCALE – I really need to blog more.
In addition to all the great things I saw in the Linux community at SCALE, the best part is the face to face communication you get, especially within your own community, namely Foresight.
Spending time with Ken, Kevin and Stu, usually after the show while grabbing a beer, we had time to talk all things Foresight. Our discussions ranged from:</description>

<p>In addition to all the great things I saw in the Linux community at SCALE, the best part is the face to face communication you get, especially within your own community, namely Foresight.</p>
<p>Spending time with <a href="http://ken.vandine.org">Ken</a>, <a href="http://www.specialkevin.com/">Kevin</a> and <a href="http://blogs.conary.com/index.php/smg">Stu</a>, usually after the show while grabbing a beer, we had time to talk all things Foresight. Our discussions ranged from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alpha 3 blockers and next steps</li>
<li>Inclusion or exclusion of proprietary codecs. This was a pretty interesting conversation that ranged from helping a user make it “just work” to what it would take to code an application similar to <a href="http://www.getautomatix.com/">Automatix</a> for Ubuntu to help users get the codecs they need. Anyone up for coding an app?</li>
<li>Using <a href="http://issues.foresightlinux.org">JIRA</a> as more than a bug tracker. There are so many features in JIRA, if we as Foresight developers can continue to add tasks to JIRA in addition to bugs, we can build a roadmap right from JIRA. Foresight continues to be a very IRC-centric community, and we don’t use the mailing lists often enough. Capturing workflows in JIRA will help both developers and users understand next steps in the development of Foresight.</li>
<li>Lots of great conversation with Kevin about the next steps for the Marketing team. From the new website development etank is rocking out on, to flyers we can pass out at upcoming shows, we talked about lots of ideas to share Foresight with new users. (And Kevin rocks more for <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/marketing/Task+List">filing these tasks in JIRA</a>!)</li>
<li>Lots of Conary talk. Not only did Ken host a BoF session on Conary Sunday night, but I learned a ton of new things about how powerful Conary really is. I think Stu even learned something new too. 🙂</li>
</ul>
<p>The best part of these in person discussions is how fired up and excited you get. The ideas are free flowing, and you really come back jazzed to get even more involved and make a difference. Foresight is still a relatively young project, and with so much to do, anyone can jump in and start helping on any number of tasks from <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/marketing/How+To+Help">web design or development</a>, <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/DEV/Foresight+Linux+2.x">packaging</a>, <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/docs/Foresight+Documentation+Team">documentation writing</a> or <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/marketing/Foresight+Linux+Marketing+Home">marketing</a>. I continue to work on the <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/general/Foresight+Love">Foresight Love project</a> modeled after <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeLove">GNOME Love</a>, and will add tasks that are easy for a new contributor to jump in and help with. I need to add some links to that page to within the wiki, and make it more specific. More to come soon.</p>

            <description>I spent last week working at my office in Los Angeles so I could also attend the Southern California Linux Expo (SCALE) this past weekend. Along with Ken VanDine and Kevin Harriss, we hosted the Foresight booth on the show floor.

(L to R, myself, Kevin Harriss and Ken VanDine)_
We also hung out with Stu, who flew in with Ken and was manning the Bongo Project booth. Not only was Stu showing off the Bongo Project, which by itself is a cool mail and calendar server and web client, he was showing a demo of it as an rPath appliance.</description>

<p><em>(Picture taken by Kevin Harris under a CC Attribution-Share Alike license)</em></p>
<p>I attended Jono Bacon’s keynote, Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: The Coming of the Linux Desktop which was a fantastic talk. Jono is right: it’s all about the community.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/2258953411/" title="dsc02190.jpg by silwenae, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>I later had the chance to catch up and chat with Jono, as well, as Ken, and we talked about the community, how we can work together, and Ken’s thoughts on helping the Patch Squad and making it easy for users to do more testing and bug triaging.</p>
<p>I met some folks at dinner Friday night, including <a href="http://eric.extremeboredom.net/2008/02/12/285">Eric</a>, <a href="http://www.vwdude.com/blog/">Christian</a> and <a href="http://www.digitalprognosis.com/">Jeff</a>, a couple of which were also at the GNOME booth next door to Foresight at the show. Chatted with Christian briefly on a new RSS reader he just started <a href="http://vwdude.com/blog/?p=21">working on</a> for GNOME, which looks awesome.</p>
<p>Saturday night Ken participated in the Weakest Geek competition (based on the TV show Weakest Link), and I’m proud to say he wasn’t one of the first two voted off. It was pretty darn funny, and other contestants included Ted Haeger (formerly of Novell), Jono Bacon (Ubuntu), Jeremy (Linuxquestions.org) and two others. The questions were hilarious, and some of the answers were even funnier.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I missed Karen Sandler’s talk Sunday. Karen is an officer of the <a href="http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> and gave a talk on <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale6x/conference-info/speakers/Karen-Sandler/">Legal Organizational Issues for Free Software Projects</a>. I’m really kicking myself for spacing this one and missing it.</p>
<p>I put up a handful of pictures in a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/sets/72157603891844482/">Flickr set</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/specialkevin/sets/72157603896957964/">Kevin has even more</a>.</p>

            <description>We’re still at SCALE, manning the Foresight booth and introducing Foresight to lots of new users. (I’ll need to check download statistics and see if we made an impact).
While here, Ken helped me get 32 bit Firefox running on my laptop, which is running 64 bit Foresight. (I missed having Flash).
There has been some discussion on the mailing list lately, and we are leaning towards including 32 bit Firefox by default, and leaving Epiphany at 64 bit for those users who want a 64 bit browser.</description>

(I’ll need to check download statistics and see if we made an impact).</p>
<p>While here, Ken helped me get 32 bit Firefox running on my laptop, which is running 64 bit Foresight. (I missed having Flash).</p>
<p>There has been <a href="http://lists.rpath.org/pipermail/foresight-devel/2008-February/000456.html">some discussion on the mailing list lately</a>, and we are leaning towards including 32 bit Firefox by default, and leaving Epiphany at 64 bit for those users who want a 64 bit browser.</p>
<p>To get 32 bit Firefox installed, run the following commands:</p>
<p><code>sudo conary erase firefox</code></p>
<p><code>sudo conary update firefox['is: x86']</code></p>
<p><code>sudo conary erase nspluginwrapper['is: x86_64']</code></p>
<p><code>sudo conary update gtk-engines:lib['is: x86']</code></p>
<p><code>sudo conary erase nspluginwrapper['is: x86']</code></p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>And voila, Firefox is now runnning 32 bit, and Flash should just work.</p>
<p>Thanks to Ken for walking me through it this morning.</p>

            <description>A few anniversaries:
 Last month was 5 years of blogging. Wow! From your basic blog / diary, to more tech and copyright oriented, to almost all Linux all the time, it’s been quite a journey. I’m sure my friends will give me even more crap about it now. Last month marks 9 years since I first installed Red Hat 5.2 that I bought right after Christmas. (I still own the original box and CD).</description>

<li>Last month marks 9 years since I first installed Red Hat 5.2 that I bought right after Christmas. (I still own the original box and CD). Next month will be my 3 year anniversary of being exclusive with Linux. Don’t miss Windows one bit. Get my gaming fix via Xbox 360 and Wii these days.</li>
<li>I’m a year older this Saturday. I’m now leaving the coveted 25-34 demographic. Sigh.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m off to Los Angeles first thing in the morning, and working out there this week. So if you don’t see me in IRC or blogging, now you know why. This weekend I will be at <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/">SCALE</a> at the Los Angeles Airport Westin. You’ll be able to find in the bright green t-shirt. Someone buy me a drink on Saturday.</p>

            <description>I’ve read enough of the stories of Microsoft’s takeover bid for Yahoo!, and I hate to contribute more, but Wired has a great story on the Flickr communities’ reaction.
I’m a Yahoo! user by acquisition. I absolutely adore Flickr, with over 4000 photos posted and viewed over 67,000 times. (My Foresight screenshot is #1 for me with 2000 views). I bought a Pro account when Flickr first launched, ages before it was acquired, and was rewarded for overpaying by gaining a year.</description>

<p>I’m a Yahoo! user by acquisition. I absolutely adore <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, with over 4000 photos posted and viewed over 67,000 times. (My Foresight screenshot is #1 for me with 2000 views). I bought a Pro account when Flickr first launched, ages before it was acquired, and was rewarded for overpaying by gaining a year. I have hundreds of bookmarks at <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> (which annoy Planet readers to no end as they auto-post to my blog). I applaud Yahoo!s recent OpenID implementation.</p>
<p>But I’ve seen first hand what Microsoft does with its acquisitions. If I was a Yahoo! shareholder, I’d take the money and run. Their stock has been declining for years. Their search market share is stagnant. Their media strategy, including music, isn’t really working.</p>
<p>But does it have to be Microsoft? Please, no. Anyone know how to migrate photos from Flickr to Picasa?</p>

            <description>And now, the news:
 Alpha 3 is out! Read the release notes, and remember this is an alpha – things will break, and it’s not quite ready for everyday use yet, but it’s close. Download here. The Foresight mailing lists are down due to this weekend’s rBuilder maintenance. Something about the MX record being screwy. Hopefully will be back soon. Foresight users outside of the US should see speed improvements in Conary now that rBuilder is in a new data center.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>And now, the news:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alpha 3 is out! Read the <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/releases/2-alpha-3/">release notes</a>, and remember this is an alpha – things will break, and it’s not quite ready for everyday use yet, but it’s close. <a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/foresight/release?id=5953">Download here</a>.</li>
<li>The Foresight mailing lists are down due to this weekend’s <a href="http://www.rpath.com/rbuilder">rBuilder</a> maintenance. Something about the MX record being screwy. Hopefully will be back soon. Foresight users outside of the US should see speed improvements in Conary now that rBuilder is in a new data center.</li>
<li>No one replied to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/foresight-mktg/browse_thread/thread/3f01de6c7c79e42c">my thread on the Marketing mailing list</a> about the website that I linked to last week, and what they like in a website and what they don’t. That makes me sad. That might be ok, because:</li>
<li>We have another website mockup! Thorsten, a relatively new Foresight user, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/foresight-mktg/browse_thread/thread/fafcb486a877b1d">submitted to the marketing list</a> a <a href="http://thorstenpeh.de/uploads/foresight+linux/website+mock-up.png">potential mockup</a> for the new foresightlinux.org. Combined with <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/~nixternal/SiteMockups">Nixternal’s recent mockups</a>, I think we can have some discussion and pick one and start coding.</li>
<li>I created a new page on the wiki – <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/general/Foresight+Love">Foresight Love</a>. Modeled after <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeLove">GNOME-Love</a>, which are bugs tasked in GNOME’s Bugzilla as “GNOME Love”, which means they’re easy to fix and good for beginners. The goal of this wiki page is similar to that and to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-gnome/">GNOME GHOP</a>, where developers can add to an ever growing to-do list of things that are easy for a new contributor to jump in an do. The page is still a framework, I need to add lots more links within the wiki and tasks. If you are a Foresight developer, and know of some easy tasks someone new could try, add them! This was inspired by Ken updating a page on the wiki last week listing all the trivial bugs in <a href="http://issues.foresightlinux.org">JIRA</a>.</li>
<li>Foresight will be at <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/">SCALE</a> next month, and now <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/foresight-mktg/browse_thread/thread/b1fcef7115398232">Flourish in Chicago in April</a>. Nice work <a href="http://www.specialkevin.com/">Kevin</a>.</li>
<li>I was introduced to <a href="http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/">Gobby</a> over the weekend. Gobby is a real time collaborative text editor. While I don’t think it will work for the userguide since we’re already using Mercurial, I think it might work well for things like the release notes, new website copy, or even the newsletter once we start publishing that in a blog and not the wiki. (Writing the wiki markup in Gobby would be kind of a chore). More to come.</li>
<li>If you’re looking for me in IRC or on email this week, I’ll be back Friday. Off to a conference for work all week.</li>

            <guid>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2008/01/google-accounts/</guid>
            <description>I have a few different Google accounts I use, including two for email, one for backup, and a Google for Domains account (pcutler at foresightlinux dot org).
I forward all my email to my primary account (silwenae at gmail dot com), and use that account to log in to all my Google services. Within that account, I have selected pcutler at foresightlinux dot org as my main account to send email from, when logged in as silwenae.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a few different Google accounts I use, including two for email, one for backup, and a Google for Domains account (pcutler at foresightlinux dot org).</p>
<p>I forward all my email to my primary account (silwenae at gmail dot com), and use that account to log in to all my Google services. Within that account, I have selected pcutler at foresightlinux dot org as my main account to send email from, when logged in as silwenae. Gmail makes this all pretty easy from it’s settings menu within Gmail.</p>
<p>One of the recent challenges I had, is that I’ve created a couple Google Groups for Foresight mailing lists. Since I was logged in to Google as silwenae, and my default email to send from is pcutler at foresight, I kept getting bounce messages when I’d try to email the group as I’d forget that I had to change my send email address in Gmail. So I then created another Google account for pcutler at foresight, subscribed to the group, but now I was subscribed as two different users. It fixed the problem, but wasn’t elegant.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/01/associate-email-addresses-with-google.html">Google Operating System Blog posted about associating another email address</a> with your Google account. Similar to how Gmail allows you to associate another email account (including receiving and sending emails), it allows you to use all of Google’s services, such as Calendar or Groups, with this account.</p>
<p>I had to delete the new Google account I set up using pcutler @ foresight, and then followed the steps above. Then, in Google Groups, I went to “Edit my Membership”, and it asks: What address do you want to use for this group? I selected pcutler @ foresight and voila, all fixed, with a much more elegant solution.</p>
<p>For those of you with @foresightlinux.org accounts, this trick may come in handy.</p>

            <description>The difference between winning and losing in the NFL is so small, but the emotions you feel afterward, winning as opposed to losing, is so great that its really not fair. When you lose, its almost like a part of you died. When you win, youve never felt more alive.

  Work on the updated Userguide continues. A Foresight-Docs mailing list was created on Google Groups. Japanese translation is almost complete!

<p>Work on the updated Userguide continues. A <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/foresight-docs">Foresight-Docs mailing list was created on Google Groups</a>. Japanese translation <a href="http://lists.rpath.org/pipermail/foresight-i18n/2008-January/000036.html">is almost complete</a>!</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://planet.foresightlinux.org/">Planet Foresight</a> has re-launched, leaving Django behind, and now using Venus, a fork of Planet. <a href="http://www.smerpology.org/sprocket/">Smerp gives an overview</a> of Venus, and how he used rBuilder to create the appliance and how it can be customized. (Anyone out there up for creating a Foresight theme?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first Focus meeting occurred. Focus is a Foresight steering committee. I created a <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/general/Focus">wiki page for it</a> and <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/general/January+11th+2008+Meeting+Minutes">published the meeting minutes</a>. Congratulations to Eric Lake and Will Farrington, the first to be formally approved through the new process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/downloads/">download page</a> links are fixed. Oops!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PackageKit errors are much more verbose now. Have you noticed? Fedora interviews Richard Hughes, PackageKit’s maintainer, who gives a <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Interviews/PackageKit">nice shout out to Foresight:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has their been interest from other distributions about incorporating this?</p>
<p>RH: Much. PackageKit is shipped by default in Foresight Linux and the GNOME Developer Kit. There’s also interest from Ubuntu, openSUSE, openSolaris, Mandriva, OpenMOKO and a few more that we can’t announce yet.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a marketing meeting this past Wednesday, which I will be publishing the minutes of this weekend. More of a status update, we will be deploying more appliances, including Mercurial, and best of all, a new forum! <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/products/forums/">Jive Software</a> has provided us with a free unlimited license as an open source project, and we’ll also be deploying <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd/">Crowd</a> to manage single sign on between Jive, JIRA and Confluence. Cross your fingers, we should have it up mid to late February.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rumor is, an Alpha 3 release should be on the way shortly too.</p>

            <description>After a two year break, I signed up for Netflix again. Towards the end of my last subscription, I was paying $15 / month to hang on to two or three DVDs I never got around to watching. I’m the type of customer Netflix loves – really active, then a couple months of inactivity.
To curb my habit of buying Blu-Ray movies (they’re so pretty in HD!), I signed up again yesterday.</description>

I’m the type of customer Netflix loves – really active, then a couple months of inactivity.</p>
<p>To curb my habit of buying Blu-Ray movies (they’re so pretty in HD!), I signed up again yesterday. And today comes news <a href="http://http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hmWhbax4gS2VJut9cNnpBf2DlwwwD8U55DF00">they are offering unlimited watching of movies online</a>. Of course, it’s Windows only, so sucks to be me. Still not a good enough reason to use Windows though!</p>

            <title>What a weekend of football</title>

            <description>What a weekend! First, the Packers take apart the Seahawks after a costly start, with a game to remember on the Frozen Tundra with the snow blowing. And then the Cowboys, the #1 seed, lose to the Giants at Texas stadium.
It’s somehow fitting that 10 years after the Packers won the Super Bowl after hosting the NFC Championship game, that they host another one.
Cross your fingers my playoff tickets come through!</description>

            <description>I’m involved in a CD swap, so I thought I would put a compilation together of some of my favorite songs released in 2007. I had to pare my initial list down from about 35 to 21 to get it to fit on one CD, so some good ones got left off.

            <description>The news is everywhere: Warner, the last remaining major studio to support both high def video formats in HD-DVD and Blu-Ray has announced that as of May they will support Blu-Ray exclusively.
Toshiba, owner of the HD-DVD patent? Suprised. And even better, Warner, unlike Universal when they went HD-DVD exclusive, didn’t take a dime.
Even though both formats are burdened with DRM, I have to say I love my Blu-Ray player – it’s amazing the difference in HD.</description>

            <description>It’s been a while since I’ve written (or written about) Foresight Documentation.
Work has resumed on getting the Userguide to 1.0, with commits happening on almost a nightly basis (except last night, as I reinstalled the Foresight alpha on my laptop, but I did work on screenshots).
The main focus is removing all mentions of the (now deprecated) Foresight System Manager and replacing them with information on how to use PackageKit.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a while since I’ve written (or written about) Foresight Documentation.</p>
<p>Work has resumed on getting the Userguide to 1.0, with commits happening on almost a nightly basis (except last night, as I reinstalled the Foresight alpha on my laptop, but I did work on screenshots).</p>
<p>The main focus is removing all mentions of the (now deprecated) Foresight System Manager and replacing them with information on how to use PackageKit.</p>
<p>The secondary goal is to close all outstanding <a href="http://issues.foresightlinux.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?">bugs and tasks against the userguide</a>. Once all bugs are complete, I will call the Userguide 1.0 and start work on 2.0. Unfortunately, I had always hoped to add more pages to the userguide, such as expanding how to burn an ISO and pages on X-Chat and Liferea, but those will probably only be in 2.0.</p>
<p>Userguide 2.0 will be created in a new Mercurial repository, and be set up to provide documentation for all editions, including GNOME, KDE and XFCE. (Alphabetical, not in order of personal preference, really!) In addition to the new pages mentioned above, I hope to have more timely updates, as well making it easy for people to add content, and maybe a whole section just devoted to development. Yup, it’s time to take it to the next level!</p>
<p>Docs can’t be a one person show, so help me make documentation on Foresight a thing of beauty. I’ve created a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/foresight-docs">mailing list at Google Groups</a> to discuss docs – I’d love to hear any thoughts anyone has on what documentation should be included, and would also love some more volunteers to truly make documentation something that lives and breathes with frequent updates.</p>

            <description>I’m in the process of changing servers at my current host, and the last website I had to do was this one. Over the course of last weekend, I decided to finish it, and did a mysqldump of my WordPress database, in addition to updating to the latest version to avoid a security flaw. I about had a heart attack when I saw my database (not gzipped) was 3.3 gigabytes. Sure, I’ve been blogging for 5 years (more on that later this month), but 3.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m in the process of changing servers at my current host, and the last website I had to do was this one. Over the course of last weekend, I decided to finish it, and did a mysqldump of my <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> database, in addition to updating to the latest version to avoid a security flaw. I about had a heart attack when I saw my database (not gzipped) was 3.3 gigabytes. Sure, I’ve been blogging for 5 years (more on that later this month), but 3.3GB? My wife explained to me how it was possible, but I was still a bit stunned.</p>
<p>I’ve had a database plugin, <a href="http://lesterchan.net/portfolio/programming.php">WP-DBManager</a>, installed for some time to automate my database backup. It adds a Database tab to your WordPress admin panel. In addition to backing up your database, it can optimize, repair or drop tables. The default page it pulls up is a list of all tables in your database, with columns showing records, data usage, index usage, and overhead.</p>
<p>Sure enough, an old plugin I haven’t used in a long time, <a href="http://fleshy.org.nz/yum/ez-scrobbler/">EZ Scrobbler</a> for managing <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/silwenae/">my Last.fm feed</a>, had it’s cache table in the database taking up 2.9GB. I used WP-DBManager’s tab to empty the table, and my database is down to a more manageable 300 MB. I’m glad I now use <a href="http://www.last.fm/widgets/">Last.fm’s widget</a> to show recent tracks played.</p>
<p>I just wish I had remembered to check that before I spent 10 hours this weekend watching 3 gigs transfer over the ‘net.</p>

My favorites this year (so far, after 3 listens):
  The Illuminoids with Donita Sparks – Pretend We’re Alala (L7 vs. CSS) – Los Angeles    team9 – Britney – Dead Or Alive?</description>

            <description>One of my New Year’s Resolutions this year was to get more involved with GNOME and / or Ubuntu when the year started. Having used Ubuntu since it was first released, and Linux and GNOME specifically since 1999, I really wanted to give something back. After being utterly confused on where to even start with Ubuntu due to the number of volunteers and convoluted processes, I decided to start with GNOME.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my New Year’s Resolutions this year was to get more involved with <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> and / or Ubuntu when the year started. Having used <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> since it was first released, and Linux and GNOME specifically since 1999, I really wanted to give something back. After being utterly confused on where to even start with Ubuntu due to the number of volunteers and convoluted processes, I decided to start with GNOME.</p>
<p>I started the year strong, volunteering to help GNOME with the website revamp, including writing a few pages of content for the revamp, and editing a few more. (The new site still isn’t out so not sure if they’ll be using it or not).</p>
<p>I also volunteered to create a GNOME Live CD in January, and after a week or two of researching, was introduced to <a href="http://ken.vandine.org">Ken VanDine</a> who had also offered to help. Turns out Ken is the lead developer of <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org">Foresight Linux</a>, and using the Conary and rPath tools, it was easy for him to create not just a Live CD, but other images including VMWare and QEMU as well.</p>
<p>In talking to Ken, and looking for more information on Foresight, I started hanging out in Foresight’s IRC channel on Freenode, and was impressed with the community, their communication and willingness to help others. <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/newsletter/2007/07/01/">See the June Foresight Newsletter for more.</a></p>
<p>And that began my journey in to Foresight. I installed Foresight shortly after, and just started helping out, first by answering questions in IRC (even when they were the wrong answer), and then really diving in, writing the monthly newsletter and then working on documentation. First developing the <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/docs/Getting+Started+with+Foresight+Linux">userguide on the wiki</a>, and then teaching myself docbook and writing and publishing the userguide in Docbook to be included in Foresight.</p>
<p>Additionally with Foresight, I’m trying to help as a project manager, including keeping tabs on the different workstreams and communication within the group. I’ve been testing the first alpha of Foresight released in early November, and last but not least, continue to work on being a bugmaster and triage issues and tasks in <a href="http://issues.foresightlinux.org">JIRA</a>.</p>
<p>I’m also happy with getting the <a href="http://www.tclug.org/">Twin Cities Linux Usergroup</a> meetings back off the ground after a two year hiatus, even though I haven’t had time to help out in the last few months in planning or organizing meetings.</p>
<p>The resolution I didn’t get to was creating my first podcast. I’ve had the songs picked out, but Jokosher didn’t work exactly as I hoped (as Audacity isn’t in our repos). I also wasn’t happy with my microphone quality. I’ll have to work on this one for next year.</p>
<p>Overall, a great year, and I’m very happy in being able to give back and help out, and looking to do more in 2008!</p>

            <description>One of the criticisms Foresight 1.x and 2.0 have been dinged for is lack of a good bittorrent client included in the official repositories.
Yesterday Antonio (aka doniphon) officially committed Deluge to the Foresight 2.0 (still alpha!) repository. I am happy to report after a night of testing, it works wonderfully! Thank you Antonio!
Get it: sudo conary update deluge
pscott has maintained Deluge in his personal repository for 1.x (due to some Boost issues, I believe), which has also worked well for Foresight 1.</description>

            <description>One of the things I’ll be working on this weekend as I try and finish up the December newsletter, is adding a “Year in Review” section for this months issue.
From our 1.0 release this past January to alpha 1 of 2.0 in December and everything in between, I’m looking to capture the highlights this year for Foresight, it’s users and developers.
Have an idea? Email me at pcutler at foresightlinux dot org or leave a comment below, and you can be part of the newsletter!</description>

            <description>Planet Foresight is moving!
Currently located at www.foresightlinux.org/planet you may have noticed that it now only updates once a day. The current planet uses Feedjack, a Django module, which was crashing our webserver for some unknown reason and we had to turn off updates and instead run a cron job.
Our resident Alaskan, smithj (with his own shiny new blog!), has been kind enough to set us up with our own Venus planet appliance, now at http://planet.</description>

            <description>As someone who has for a long time wanted to get involved with an open source project, and specifically GNOME, the GNOME Developer Kit is a true blessing. (And more on my wanting to get involved in a different post in a week or so).
The GNOME Developer Kit is fully functional operating system with the latest (unstable) branch of GNOME. Available as an ISO you can install on your hard drive, or a VMWare image you can boot within your current OS, it has everything you need to start contributing back to GNOME.</description>

<p>The <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeDeveloperKit">GNOME Developer Kit</a> is fully functional operating system with the latest (unstable) branch of GNOME. Available as an ISO you can install on your hard drive, or a VMWare image you can boot within your current OS, it has everything you need to start contributing back to GNOME. The GNOME Developer Kit is based on <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org">Foresight Linux</a>, and uses Conary and PackageKit to stay updated with the latest commits from GNOME Subversion. Both the Dev Kit and Foresight were created by <a href="http://ken.vandine.org/?p=293">Ken VanDine</a>, Foresight’s lead developer.</p>
<p>Og Maciel, a GNOME contributor, <a href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=429">blogged about using the GNOME Developer Kit in assisting the translation teams</a>. One comment in particular caught my attention, <a href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=429#comment-74444">asking if translations were too hard</a> of an area for someone new to contributing to start with.</p>
<p>With this in mind, what kind of documentation should be included with the GNOME Developer Kit, and where should it live? Getting started in open source can be daunting, and GNOME can sometimes come off as a bit of a clique, making it even harder for someone to start. Translations, bug triaging, and documentation are typically easy areas for someone new to start, but I’ve seen some challenges first hand trying to get involved. I don’t have any answers, but some of the questions that come to mind for me are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should documentation live on the image or on the wiki?</li>
<li>If on the wiki, should it link to other sections of the GNOME wiki (live.gnome.org or LGO for short)? (For example, the “Testing Patches” is linked on the GNOME Dev Kit’s LGO page to the Testing Patches LGO page.)</li>
<li>If on the image, should it be a docbook file similar to the <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/docs/Getting+Started+with+Foresight+Linux">Foresight User Guide</a>, or just an HTML page?</li>
<li>What common tasks for developers should be documented? Think back to when you were just getting started with contributing, what questions came to mind?</li>
<li>What else?</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting started with contributing back to an open source project takes determination and even a bit of courage. Tools like the GNOME Developer Kit help make that start even easier.</p>

            <description>A big thank you to the EFF and Sen. Chris Dodd for helping to kill the Telecom Immunity bill yesterday in the Senate. The EFF has been at the forefront of this issue from day one, and Sen. Dodd’s leadership and bravery in taking a stand yesterday threatening to filibuster this bill until it died caused Sen. Reid to pull it at this point in time.
Boing Boing’s Cory Doctorow sums it up well:</description>

<p>Here’s the thing: EFF and others are suing the telecoms for participating in the wiretapping program. These lawsuits are the best chance we have of getting the details of the program into the public, so we can finally find out what the NSA have been doing to us all these years. The reason the government wants to grant the telecoms immunity is to keep the dirty laundry in the closet — to keep us from finding out how they’ve been breaking the law.</p>

            <description>A brief post as I’m still traveling for work. Here are a couple big and small packages in development that I’m excited about:
 Flyback: A GUI wrapper for rsync and rsnapshot to make backup easier, that is often compared to Apple’s Time Machine. It’s a python script that creates a GUI for the user and makes it simple to create and schedule backups of a user’s directories and files. Choose which directory, files, hidden files, and it sends the back up to a directory of your choosing.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A brief post as I’m still traveling for work. Here are a couple big and small packages in development that I’m excited about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/flyback/">Flyback</a>: A GUI wrapper for rsync and rsnapshot to make backup easier, that is often compared to Apple’s Time Machine. It’s a python script that creates a GUI for the user and makes it simple to create and schedule backups of a user’s directories and files. Choose which directory, files, hidden files, and it sends the back up to a directory of your choosing. It’s still very early in development, and I didn’t see a way to send a backup to a network share that’s mounted in GNOME. But I believe most users don’t backup enough, and for a distribution like that Foresight, that “just works”, backup should be added to the list of things that just work for a user.</li>
<li><a href="http://do.davebsd.com/">GNOME-DO</a>: A Quicksilver-like application that is difficult to explain, but can increase your productivity ten fold by making it easy to quickly open applications, jump between open windows and more. See <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2007/12/10/gnome-do-quick-program-and-file-launcher-for-ubuntu-linux/">more at Download Squad including a video</a> of GNOME-Do in action.</li>
<li><a href="http://registry.gimp.org/plugin?id=11348">Publishr</a>, a small one, but looks useful, Publishr adds a “publish” plug-in to GIMP to make it easy to send your images to Picasa or Flickr. Sure, F-Spot has had this feature forever, but there are a lot of times when I’m editing a screenshot that I want to send to Flickr that I won’t put in my F-Spot library, and this plugin will help skip a step by having to use Flickr’s web upload feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m definitely going to keep an eye on these applications, and may add to my Foresight repository when I get some time.</p>

            <title>Bladerunner:  The Final Cut</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2007/12/bladerunner-the-final-cut/</link>

            <description>I headed to downtown Minneapolis Friday afternoon, and caught a screening of Bladerunner: The Final Cut.
It’s been 48 hours since I saw the film, and it touches me in a way few films do – I sit here and still struggle to put in to words the emotions Bladerunner evokes for me. From the themes of consumerism and humanism to the grim picture the film paints of the future, few science fiction films hold up as well as Bladerunner does after twenty-five years.</description>

            <title>Setting up a Foresight 2 build environment, Part 1</title>

            <description>I don’t fancy myself a Linux developer, thought I aspire to be one someday. I can barely manage my own systems, and consider myself more of a power user.
One of the advantages of Foresight Linux though, is how easy it is to get started, both in creating and managing packages, and in how open the community is in welcoming you when you decide to start, and answering your (dumb) questions.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don’t fancy myself a Linux developer, thought I aspire to be one someday. I can barely manage my own systems, and consider myself more of a power user.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of Foresight Linux though, is how easy it is to get started, both in creating and managing packages, and in how open the community is in welcoming you when you decide to start, and answering your (dumb) questions.</p>
<p>The upcoming 2.0 release of Foresight requires a slightly different setup and methodology for packaging. Here is a brief overview of how I set up my PC for creating packages on Foresight 2. (And if I’m doing something wrong, please leave a comment!)</p>
<p>[</p>
<p>Visit the Foresight 2.0 Developer page on the wiki.]<a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/DEV/Foresight+Linux+2.x">1</a> (A big thanks to thilo and doniphon for the information on this page).</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Step one**: Add the development packages to your system. From a terminal type:</p>
<p><code>sudo conary update group-devel</code></p>
<p><strong>Step two</strong>: Create a .conaryrc file. Open Gedit (Applications -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Text Editor) and copy the .conaryrc example from the wiki link above and save it in your user’s home directory as .conaryc</p>
<p><strong>Step three</strong>: Create a .rmakerc file. Open a new tab in Gedit and copy and paste the .rmakerc example from the above wiki page.</p>
<p><strong>Step four</strong>: Edit your .bashrc file. In Gedit click Open, and hit Ctrl-H to show hidden files, and double click .bashrc. At the bottom of the file, copy and paste the .bashrc group cooks from the wiki page above.</p>
<p><strong>Step five</strong>: Create the directories needed. From your user’s home directory:</p>
<p>mkdir conary</p>
<p>mkdir -p ~/conary/foresight.rpath.org ~/conary/builds ~/conary/cache</p>
<p><strong>Step six</strong>: Create your context. In a terminal type:</p>
<p><code>cvc context fl:2-devel</code></p>
<p>And that’s it! I wouldn’t be surprised if there are quicker and / or easier ways to do this, but this is what worked for me, with pointers from Ken.</p>
<p>Next time: Checking out and updating a package.</p>

            <description>As a GNOME guy, I don’t use KDE.
As it was pointed out to me today (thanks Og!), without any intended ill intent, I left off any news of KDE in the Foresight Newsletter I’m working on.
One of the cool things coming with Foresight 2.0, is a KDE edition and a XFCE edition. The beauty of open source is choice – whether it’s a desktop environment, music player or your choice of web server.</description>

<p>As it was pointed out to me today (thanks Og!), without any intended ill intent, I left off any news of KDE in the Foresight Newsletter I’m working on.</p>
<p>One of the cool things coming with Foresight 2.0, is a KDE edition and a XFCE edition. The beauty of open source is choice – whether it’s a desktop environment, music player or your choice of web server.</p>
<p>The KDE edition is a little further along than the XFCE edition at this point, and one-ups the GNOME edition in the fact that it’s only 695 MB! One of these days we will get the GNOME edition to fit on a single CD. 🙂</p>
<p>Jtate and Int are leading the way in developing the KDE edition, which is also attracting new Foresight users such as Nixternal, whom you may know from such shows as Planet Ubuntu or Chicago LUG, and old Foresight users such as Og, who’s helping translate KDE to pt-br.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the KDE <a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/foresight/build?id=13206">x86 version here</a> or the <a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/foresight/build?id=13207">x86_64 version here</a></li>
<li>Add KDE to an existing GNOME alpha edition: <code>sudo conary update group-kde</code> (Not 100% sure this works)</li>
<li><a href="http://issues.foresightlinux.org/browse/KDE">File bugs here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now is a great time to get involved with Foresight – whether it’s helping polish the GNOME edition, help building the KDE or XFCE editions, or helping on any number of tasks in progress, such as documentation writing; bug triaging; building our next generation website or forums, or helping with marketing and attracting new users.</p>
<p>More information coming in this month’s newsletter!</p>

            <description>My favorite late 80’s / early 90’s rock band, Extreme, has announced their re-union, along with a new album and tour in 2008.
Say what you will about More than Words and Hole Hearted, but when Extreme came out in 1989 with their first album, and Pornograffiti in 1990, they had a refreshing twist on the hair metal bands of the day. Their blend of funk, with horns, and Nuno’s guitar playing put them head and shoulders above their contemporaries, such as Winger, Slaughter or Poison.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My favorite late 80’s / early 90’s rock band, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/extreme">Extreme</a>, has <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&amp;friendID=126988114">announced</a> their re-union, along with a <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/track/celebrity/view.bg?articleid=1047228">new album and tour</a> in 2008.</p>
<p>Say what you will about More than Words and Hole Hearted, but when Extreme came out in 1989 with their first album, and Pornograffiti in 1990, they had a refreshing twist on the hair metal bands of the day. Their blend of funk, with horns, and Nuno’s guitar playing put them head and shoulders above their contemporaries, such as Winger, Slaughter or Poison.</p>
<p>I saw them a number of times live, including headlining at the <a href="http://www.therave.com/">Eagle’s Club</a> right after Pornograffitti was released, with Alice in Chains opening, before Alice in Chains broke big. One of the two times I saw Alice in Chains, and it was already clear that Layne Staley was in the throes of the heroin addiction that would later kill him, as Alice in Chains performance was awful, and they were booed off the stage.</p>
<p>Extreme live was a different story – Gary Cherone’s energy is infectious, and Nuno’s guitar playing is absolutely amazing. I’ve seen them in everything from a small club to an arena, and they always rocked the house. I always swore I wouldn’t be one of those old guys who goes to concerts of the bands he followed in high school, but I may have to make an exception for this one.</p>

            <description>Og’s latest blog post links to David Bolter’s blog with a post on “Transparency in Community Decisions”. David writes:
 Transparency should be applied to how decisions can get made in FOSS communities. This can involve different layers; for example, transparency could apply to:
 Who gets to participate in decision making.    How these people are selected.    The process of decision making.  In FOSS communities I think transparency should apply to all three where reasonably possible.</description>

David writes:</p>
<blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Who gets to participate in decision making.</li>

<ol start="2">

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>The process of decision making.</li>
</ol>
<p>In FOSS communities I think transparency should apply to all three where reasonably possible. What do I mean by this? Let’s take a couple of examples:</p>
<p>A) Getting hired by a FOSS organization which is integral to the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>B) Getting commit access to an svn repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>C) Getting syndication of one’s blog onto a planet/aggregator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The timing of this couldn’t be better. The <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/marketing/Foresight+Linux+Marketing+Home">Foresight Marketing Team</a> is about to tackle some of these exact tasks, specifically on what it means to become a user and developer within Foresight. This includes perks, such as IRC hostmasks or foresightlinux.org email addresses, but more importantly how to get commit access.</p>
<p>We don’t have all of the answers yet, especially for 1-3 above (other than <a href="http://ken.vandine.org">Ken</a> gets veto power!). But David’s post highlights the need for transparency, not only in how we build these processes, but how we execute them going forward.</p>
<p>We will be having a Marketing meeting sometime in the next week or so, with details to come soon.</p>

            <description>Yes, the title is right. Are you running the alpha of Foresight Linux 2.0? We want, no, need your bugs!
The alpha has been out for a couple of weeks now, and only ten bugs have been filed against the alpha, with two of them fixed. And I’d argue a couple more aren’t really bugs, but enhancements or tasks.
Please, please file bugs against the alpha. This way we know what needs to be fixed or needs improving.</description>

            <description>If you were paying close attention to my blog a week ago, buried in my del.ico.us links were 2 links to Blu-ray news, including one on the state of Blu-Ray.
This was all research with the intention of buying a Blu-Ray player, which I ended up doing a week ago Sunday. I was lucky enough to find a second generation Samsung player, the BD-P1200. Why a second generation player, and not one of the third generation players that are profile 1.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you were paying close attention to my blog a week ago, buried in my <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=885">del.ico.us links were 2 links to Blu-ray news</a>, including one on the state of Blu-Ray.</p>
<p>This was all research with the intention of buying a Blu-Ray player, which I ended up doing a week ago Sunday. I was lucky enough to find a second generation Samsung player, the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ca/products/blu_ray/blu_ray/bd_p1200xac.asp">BD-P1200</a>. Why a second generation player, and not one of the third generation players that are profile 1.2 and just hitting retail shelves? It’s all about the Silicon Optix HQV video processor included, the only Blu-Ray player to include one. Where the HQV shines is on upscaling normal DVDs and is one of the best video processors ever made. Due to trying to reduce costs, Samsung did not include it on the BD-P1200’s successor, the BD-P1400. (Read more on the HQV video processor at the <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/video-players-and-recorders/samsung-bd-p1200/4505-6463_7-32391011.html">CNET BD-P1200 review under DVD performance</a>.)</p>
<p>The quality of Blu-Ray discs is amazing. I expected to be good, on par with high-def TV, but it’s amazing. I’m lucky enough to own a 1080p TV, and I can’t get over the video quality of the movies I’ve watched so far. I bought a handful of movies with the player, and so far I’ve had the opportunity to watch both Fantastic Four movies, and Live Free or Die Hard.</p>
<p>I bought my Samsung player a week ago Sunday, at night, and promptly left for L.A. the next morning for work, returning late Thursday night. I then had plans all of last weekend, and was home only a few days before coming home to Milwaukee this weekend for Thanksgiving, so I haven’t had much time to enjoy it yet.</p>
<p>I still have to watch a normal DVD and see how good the HQV video processor is. I made sure the first thing I did was update the firmware – plugging in via ethernet I wasn’t able to grab an IP, but burning the firmware to a CD-R and popping it in was easy enough. I’m not concerned about being limited to a 1.1 BD profile – the only thing 1.2 allows is picture-in-picture for things such as director commentary. Until players come out in a couple of years at BD profile 2.0, this player will do just fine, and by then the cost will have come down and I’ll want to replace my other DVD players in the house.</p>
<p>I’m also not concerned about the pitched battle between Blu-Ray and HD-DVD. A few months ago I was 100% sure Blu-Ray was going to win, but now it’s looking like a stalemate and both formats will be around for at least a few years. HD-DVD only has 2 studios in their camp, and one of those they had to pay $150 million for to be exclusive for the next year. Blu-Ray has all the other studios, and all the hardware manufacturers, except Toshiba, so I’m betting Sony will have it’s first format win in a long time.</p>
<p>If I hadn’t come in to some extra money, I don’t know if I would have bought one, but am I glad I did. The picture quality is beautiful and I can’t believe the difference between Blu-Ray and DVD.</p>

            <description>Unreal Tournament 3 was released Monday. But the Linux client demo never appeared, and the Linux retail server and client haven’t appeared yet either.
The UT3 mailing list has also been quiet recently, but last night Icculus sent a tweet out and the news hit the mailing list soon after: UT3’s Linux bits are hung up in legal. Somewhere along the way Epic licensed some middleware that can’t be included in the Linux version.</description>

<p>In related news, no Gears of War for Linux, only Mac. Something about the publisher who is based in Redmond squashing that idea. Damn them.</p>

            <description>I more than enjoy the Guitar Hero franchise, having got my PS2 out of the closet a year and a half ago after buying all the Guitar Hero games, including this last one on the 360 for the first time.
Tomorrow marks the release of Rock Band, and Ars Technica takes a look at it and approves.
I’m pretty excited to get it, even with the high price point, as a few of us have been known to get together and rock out to Guitar Hero.</description>

<p>Tomorrow marks the release of Rock Band, and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/games/rock-band-review.ars">Ars Technica takes a look</a> at it and approves.</p>
<p>I’m pretty excited to get it, even with the high price point, as a few of us have been known to get together and rock out to Guitar Hero. Now we just need to find a 4th… And I can play with Alex, who I am sure will get a kick out of banging the drums. I’m happy the Guitar Hero guitar works with Rock Band, but very disappointed the Rock Band guitar doesn’t work with Guitar Hero as I don’t want to buy another guitar, but really want to unlock the co-op songs in GHIII. Hopefully they will patch the 360 version so the Rock Band guitar will work with GHIII sometime in the future.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have the room in my basement for the setup, although if I do pick it up, I won’t be able to play it until next week since we’re going home for the holiday.</p>

            <description>Phoronix has a blurb up showing off Foresight 2 (I won’t call it a story, with the exception of the opening sentence, it’s cut and paste from the release announcement).
It’s nice to see us get some press, and more importantly, there are 15 screenshots for you to peruse.</description>

            <title>Foresight 2 (Alpha 1) Released!</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2007/11/foresight-2-alpha-1-released/</link>

            <description>The Foresight team released the first alpha of Foresight 2 last night.
I had installed a couple of test versions over the last week or two on my test machine, but now we believe Foresight 2 is ready for wider testing. Note I say testing – this isn’t necessarily ready to be your everyday desktop, unless you’re very, very daring.
I’m very daring.
**
The good:**
 The installer is fast.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Foresight team <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/releases/2-alpha-1/">released the first alpha of Foresight 2</a> last night.</p>
<p>I had installed a couple of test versions over the last week or two on my test machine, but now we believe Foresight 2 is ready for wider testing. Note I say testing – this isn’t necessarily ready to be your everyday desktop, unless you’re very, very daring.</p>
<p>I’m very daring.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The good:**</p>
<ul>
<li>The installer is fast. 7 minutes or less to install on 3 different machines.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Main Desktop: Core 2 Duo (E6300), 2 gigs RAM, Nvidia 7950FGTOC</li>
<li>Test desktop: P4 3.0, 2 gigs RAM, ATI 800XT</li>
<li>Laptop: Toshiba A135-S4467, Centrino Duo, 1 gig RAM, Intel video, wireless and sound</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>x86 and our first x86_64 release</li>
<li>Compiz Fusion is installed by default, but you need to run fusion-icon manually at startup, or add it to your session. This includes Emerald as well.</li>
<li>Avant-Window-Navigator is installed in a default installation – just need to remove your bottom panel and run it from Applications -&gt; Accessories. Very cool!</li>
<li>Package Kit is the default GUI for installing updates and packages</li>
<li>If you liked Foresight 1.x, you’ll like Foresight 2.0. Your favorite apps including Banshee, F-Spot, Brasero and more. Codecs like Divx and MP3 working out of the box.</li>
</ul>
<p>**What needs to be worked on:</p>
<p>**</p>
<ul>
<li>The Intel video card drivers don’t work with Compiz Fusion on my laptop. It loads the window manager, but depending on the program, I either can’t see it’s contents (You don’t see any text inside X-Chat) or you can’t see the text you type, such as in the GNOME Terminal. Switching to Metacity, you’ll see the text you typed you couldn’t in Compiz.</li>
<li>Why is sound muted after a default install? 1.x was like that too.</li>
<li>The Nvidia drivers aren’t available in the repo. Stop by #foresight and ask for them, and either doniphon or myself can email them to you.</li>
<li>Off kernel drivers aren’t included yet, such as the IPW3945 Intel wireless driver for notebooks. (I have a 25 foot ethernet cable going to behind my TV as I type this on my laptop).</li>
<li>GIMP is not included in the default install. Using PackageKit or a simple conary update gimp will add it, but there’s no menu icon for it yet. (Yes, I filed a bug report).</li>
<li>No sound on my laptop (Intel HDA sound card). I had sound in 1.3 with the 2.6.19 kernel, but the 2.6.22 kernel with 1.4 and 2.0 I don’t have sound.</li>
<li>No flash on x86_64 installed by default (haven’t tried to install it yet)</li>
<li>Lots of packages need to be re-packaged from 1.4 to 2.0. (Now is a great time to come join the community!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please, please, please file bug reports on issues you run into with Foresight 2.0. While it’s quite usable, I wouldn’t recommend it for everyday use, yet. Expect things to break and lots of updates to become available.</p>
<p>I copied my xorg.conf file from my old install, and have Twinview working perfectly, here is your obligatory screenshot of 3560×1200:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/1953663274/" title="Photo Sharing"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>A big congratulations to all my fellow developers, volunteers and contributors to getting this first alpha out.</p>
<p>And remember: Use Foresight. Because your desktop should be cool.</p>

            <description>For those of us who grew up in the 80s, Super Tecmo Bowl was the best football game ever made. There was nothing like taking Herschel Walker 90 yards, turn around, run back to your own end zone, turn around again and run 100 yards for the score. All without being tackled.
Someone took the electrifying Packer win from last Monday night against Denver, and did a mashup with Super Tecmo Bowl.</description>

            <description>I’ve previously mentioned my enthusiasm for Blade Runner (interesting, but horrible, flash website), and was happy to see (via the Digital Bits) today that the Final Cut will be opening in Minneapolis on Nov. 30th at the Uptown Theater. I originally saw Blade Runner when the Director’s Cut was screened in 1992 in Milwaukee, and you can count on me being at the Uptown to see this final version.
The Final Cut’s December release has me seriously considering getting a Blu-Ray player, the first film to do so.</description>

            <description>It’s hard to tell from the following screenshot (unless you click through to the 1920×1200 version on Flickr), but yes, that’s experimental (note the key word, experimental) support for Compiz-Fusion on Foresight Linux 1.4.1. This includes a majority of the plugins, the Compiz-Fusion icon on the panel, and the Emerald theme manager among other things.
It seems flawless on my Nvidia card running the propietary drivers so far. ATI users using the Radeon driver have had a couple issues.</description>

<p>It’s been fun playing with it, I forgot how much stuff Beryl (and now Compiz-Fusion) has over just the vanilla Compiz.</p>
<p>A huge shout out to pscott for packaging this.</p>
<p>It’s not recommended for normal users (yet).</p>

It comes formatted as NTFS, which annoys me to no end. It lists on the box it’s NTFS, and works with XP / Vista, and MacOS, both PowerPC and Intel.</description>

<p>But NTFS is notoriously difficult to work with on Linux, though the NTFS 3G driver has made a lot of progress. And of course my system doesn’t have the NTFS 3G driver installed.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to good old FAT32?</p>
<p>How annoying. Luckily, I have a Mac Mini and one Windows box left. I was feeling lazy.</p>

            <description>The Enemy Territory:Quake Wars Linux client was released Friday by id. The 17mb client and installer is using Icculus‘ Mojo Setup for installation. This is a welcome change from the Doom3 and Quake IV installers which required you to manually copy the .pak files from the CD or DVDs over to your hard drive. With Mojo Setup, you just run the executable file you download from id, pop the DVD in and it installs the client, Punkbuster and copies the necessary files over from the DVD.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.enemyterritory.com">Enemy Territory:Quake Wars</a> Linux client was <a href="http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/linux/etqw/">released Friday by id</a>. The 17mb client and installer is using <a href="http://icculus.org/">Icculus</a>‘ <a href="http://http://icculus.org/mojosetup/">Mojo Setup</a> for installation. This is a welcome change from the Doom3 and Quake IV installers which required you to manually copy the .pak files from the CD or DVDs over to your hard drive. With Mojo Setup, you just run the executable file you download from id, pop the DVD in and it installs the client, Punkbuster and copies the necessary files over from the DVD.</p>
<p>With both the demo and the client, I was running in to keyboard lockups when playing. It didn’t matter if I was playing in full screen or windowed, the game would continue, but my keyboard was totally non-responsive. I tested Compiz enabled and disabled, windowed and non-windowed, and dual monitor and single monitor. It turns out that Pidgin, X-Chat and Mugshot would cause it to lock up. Basically, if anything appeared in the notification section Quake Wars would free the keyboard. Alt-tabbing to different applications and coming back to Quake Wars didn’t help. Disabling those applications before running Quake Wars has stopped the keyboard lockups.</p>
<p>Playing in full screen mode is definitely more immersive, and Quake Wars supports a native 1920×1200 resolution. Playing windowed in dual monitors I was playing in 1680×1250. It’s a pain though to switch xorg.conf and restart GNOME just to play a game, so I haven’t made up my mind.</p>
<p>The Quake Wars FAQ recommends a low latency kernel configured with CONFIG_HZ_1000=y. Foresight’s kernel does not include that setting, and using the Nvidia drivers currently in the repo, 100.14.03, performance has been smooth as silk. I’m running a Core 2 Duo E6300, 2 gigs of RAM and a Nvidia (BFG) 7950GT.</p>
<p>I’m enjoying the full game much more than the early beta client I played in Windows. While the game is definitely faster than Battelfield 2, it’s not as fast as I first thought. I still have a ton to learn (like joining a squad or learning to fly the air vehicles), but it’s fun. 2 out of 3 maps played this afternoon, and I was top Soldier, top kills, and close in top EXP. The promotions and unlocks by campaign is better than I expected, as I wasn’t sure how tempoary unlocks would be, but they work well. I thought I had played on a ranked server today, but <a href="http://stats.enemyterritory.com/">searching for my stats</a>, I can’t find them. Guess I need to play some more!</p>
<p>Kudos again to id for releasing a Linux client. It’s nice to have a state of the art game to play on Linux. The next month or two should be great for the state of gaming on Linux, with the rumored Gears of War release, and the definite release of Unreal Tournament 3.</p>

            <description>It’s been rumored for a while that Comcast was filtering traffic on it’s network, specifically Bittorrent, and now the AP after significant testing, according to this story on MSNBC.com.
I’m extremely disappointed to have this confirmed. After Time Warner and Comcast swapped markets a year ago, I’m now a Comcast subscriber. Time Warner and it’s Roadrunner service was an excellent internet provider – a number of years ago when I was running a home server, I received an email from Time Warner.</description>

<p>I’m extremely disappointed to have this confirmed. After Time Warner and Comcast swapped markets a year ago, I’m now a Comcast subscriber. Time Warner and it’s Roadrunner service was an excellent internet provider – a number of years ago when I was running a home server, I received an email from Time Warner. It informed me they noticed I was running a mail server, which was against it’s TOS, but they probed and it wasn’t compromised, and they let it be.</p>
<p>Comcast, on the other hand, within 3 months of taking over service, jacked up my rates by 30% (from $45 / month to $60 / month), on the premise I only had their broadband service, and not their TV or phone service, but would leave my rates at $45 if I signed up for one of those. (I still don’t understand how this isn’t illegal tying… I really wish I had gone to law school.)</p>
<p>As a Linux developer, Bittorrent is a legitimate file sharing service. I can share ISOs of the software I contribute to. Bittorrent is not just a copyright infringing service.</p>
<p>Comcast needs to wake up and smell the coffee.</p>
<p>Support <a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/">net neutrality</a>, and <a href="http://www.openinternetcoalition.com/">learn more</a>. Call your Senators and Congressional representatives, and don’t let big business ruin the internet.</p>

            <description>If you did a recent updateall in Foresight in the last day or two, there was a bug in libgnome that has been fixed.
On some default installations or a conary updateall, users would not see icons in the GNOME menu, no desktop background, and when you tried to change your theme (System -&amp;gt; Preferences -&amp;gt; Appearance) it would crash. It looks like it was a Gconf setting error upstream in GNOME.</description>

<p>On some default installations or a conary updateall, users would not see icons in the GNOME menu, no desktop background, and when you tried to change your theme (System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Appearance) it would crash. It looks like it was a Gconf setting error upstream in GNOME. It would have looked something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/1595390798/" title="Photo Sharing"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>It was set as <code>/etc/gconf/schemas/desktop_gnome_interface.schemas.in</code> and should have been <code>/etc/gconf/schemas/desktop_gnome_interface.schemas</code></p>
<p>A big shout out to Ken VanDine who tracked this down and fixed it, and is filing the bug and patch upstream as well.</p>
<p>The groups will be updated in Foresight tonight, but until then, do a <code>sudo conary update libgnome</code> and it should be fixed. For some odd reason restarting X didn’t fix it, but it was fixed on reboot.</p>
<p>This means 1.4.1 with PackageKit will be released in the next day or two.</p>

            <title>A month with Quod Libet</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2007/10/a-month-with-quod-libet/</link>

            <description>For the last month I’ve been runnign Quod Libet instead of Banshee. I had run in to two critical problems with Banshee about a month ago:
 Banshee was taking 80 minutes to start. (Since fixed, I think it was something with Foresight, as Banshee hasn’t had a release in a while). Banshee’s Last.fm reporting plugin hasn’t reported songs correctly to Last.fm for a long time. This is a known bug in the plugin, without a known fix that I’m aware of.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the last month I’ve been runnign <a href="http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet">Quod Libet</a> instead of Banshee. I had run in to two critical problems with <a href="http://www.banshee-project.org">Banshee</a> about a month ago:</p>
<ul>
<li>Banshee was taking 80 minutes to start. (Since fixed, I think it was something with Foresight, as Banshee hasn’t had a release in a while).</li>
<li>Banshee’s Last.fm reporting plugin hasn’t reported songs correctly to Last.fm for a long time. This is a known bug in the plugin, without a known fix that I’m aware of.</li>
</ul>
<p>Banshee’s Last.Fm integration may sound like something trivial, but I really enjoy browsing <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/silwenae/">my profile</a> to see what I’ve listened to. Unfortunately, my profile isn’t close to accurate as all the music I listen to at night via Banshee isn’t being reported. Between that, the old data that is still in my Last.fm profile from my wife listening to music via the Xbox (yes, the James Taylor in my profile isn’t from <strong>me</strong> listening to it), and the Last.fm radio streams, it’s not really an accurate reflection of my music tastes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet">Quod Libet</a> is a GTK+ music player, that also includes Ex Falso, a tag editor. Quod Libet is a favorite of a couple of Foresight users, so I thought I’d give that a try. A simple:</p>
<p><code>&lt;br /&gt; sudo conary update quodlibet</code></p>
<p>And it’s installed in Foresight!</p>
<p>My first impressions of Quod Libet, is that it comes across with a basic view, but once you start digging, it’s quite the powerful player. The default view includes a search box, People (artist) Album, and then the song list. Search is fast, feels a touch faster than Banshee.</p>
<p>Other views you can choose from include Playlists, Search, File System, Album, Internet Radio and Media Devices.</p>
<p>I tend to listen to full albums at a time, and not create playlists or listen to random songs, so Quod Libet has worked well for me. I’ve been impressed with it’s simplicity, and as I’ve dug deeper, even more impressed with the number of features and advanced funtionality it has. While it doesn’t have the visual appeal of Banshee, it just works, and that’s all I’ve asked it to do.</p>
<p>The only minor complaint I had, was that due to a DDOS attach, the Quod Libet team lost some it’s website, and the documentation on plugins is non-existent. While there is a nice list of plugins available, I had to get some help to figure out how to setup the sub-directories on where to put the plugins, and only one or two have worked out of the five or six I’ve attempted to install. Granted I haven’t spent that much time trying to configure the plugins, but it was just a small disappointment.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an alternative to Rhythmbox or Banshee on a GNOME desktop, give Quod Libet a chance, the best thing I can say about it is that it “just works”. And works well.</p>

            <description>I was at Lambeau Field this past Sunday to watch the Packers eventually beat themselves and lose to the Bears on national TV.
Having grown up in Wisconsin, and now living in Minnesota, the residents of Minnesota think they have a rivalry with the Bears, but any true Packer fan will tell you the only rivalry we have is with the Bears. It was my first Bears game, and the normally nice crowd was just mean when it came to the Bears.</description>

<p>Having grown up in Wisconsin, and now living in Minnesota, the residents of Minnesota think they have a rivalry with the Bears, but any true Packer fan will tell you the only rivalry we have is with the Bears. It was my first Bears game, and the normally nice crowd was just mean when it came to the Bears.</p>
<p>It didn’t help that the Packers had almost 100 yards of penalties, 6 turnovers, and didn’t rush the ball in the second half to eventually let a 10 point lead slip through their fingers.</p>
<p>I’ve added two sets of pictures from the game to my Flickr pages. I’m still having issues with focus on my DSLR when using my zoom lens in sports mode, I apologize if any are still blurry.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/sets/72157602391643408/">Pre-game pictures</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/sets/72157602394397031/">Picture during the game</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a Packer fan, join the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/greenbaypackers/">Packer group on Flickr</a>.</p>
<p>We were graced with the University of Wisconsin Marching Band before the game, during halftime, and during the second half doing their routine they also do at Camp Randall.</p>
<p>Here’s my favorite picture from the evening:</p>

            <description>We had a really good Foresight developer meeting a few weeks ago, and one of the outcomes is to start scheduling week long sprints to accomplish some tasks.
First up, is Bug Hunting Week.
With 2.0 on the horizon, it’s time to get JIRA, our issue tracker, cleaned up, and tackle all the outstanding issues in 1.4 (and older) and make sure that if the issue hasn’t been resolved, it’s at least assigned to a developer.</description>

            <description>I’ve been on a bit of a buying spree for CD’s over the last month or two, especially picking up a lot of indie bands.
In no particular order:
 The New Pornographers, Challengers: One of the best albums I’ve bought in a long time. I’ve always like the New Pornographers, but it wasn’t a disc I would spin over and over. This disc is amazing – Neko Case and the whole gang did a heck of a job writing some very memorable songs that are guaranteed to get stuck in your head.</description>

<p>In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The New Pornographers, Challengers: One of the best albums I’ve bought in a long time. I’ve always like the New Pornographers, but it wasn’t a disc I would spin over and over. This disc is amazing – Neko Case and the whole gang did a heck of a job writing some very memorable songs that are guaranteed to get stuck in your head. My favorite track by far is All the Old Showstoppers.</li>
<li>Rilo Kiley, Under the Blacklight: I bought this and the Challengers on the same day, and both of these have vied for the same playing time, with Under the Blacklight probably getting the edge in total playtime. I was introduced to Rilo Kiley a few years ago on 89.3 The Current, and ended up getting their last release free from the station at a volunteer opportunity. I really liked, but this disc is a major step forward. The title track, Under the Blacklight, 15, Smoke Detector and Give a Little Love are standout tracks. (I also picked up Take Offs and Landings, their second album but first released commercially.)</li>
<li>Interpol, Antics: Very similar to their last album, but it seems a touch more mellow. I need to listen to this one more.</li>
<li>Tegan and Sara, The Con: I absolutely adored their last disc, but this one doesn’t live up to that. The Con is more of a concept album, and while not a departure from the twins’ signature sound, it doesn’t have the 2 or 3 songs that you couldn’t get out of your head that So Jealous did.</li>
<li>Fountains of Wayne, Traffic and Weather: I don’t think these guys get the credit they deserve. They write catchy pop alternative songs with interesting lyrics, but all that everyone remembers them for is “Stacy’s Mom”. Good album, on par with their last effort.</li>
<li>Dolores O’Riordan, Are You Listening?: The former frontwoman for the Cranberries unleases a solo album that was 3 or 4 years in the making, and it was worth the wait. If you ever liked the Cranberries even just a little, pick this up. Ms. O’Riordan’s songwriting and lyrics have matured, and this album has it all, from mellow to rockin’ out.</li>
<li>Garbage, Absolute Garbage (Special Edition): Greatest hit collection from the alternative band from Madison, WI. I’ve seen Garbage live a few times, and they have always been one of my favorite bands. From Butch Vig’s catchy pop sound to Shirley Manson growling or purring, Garbage is the real thing. I made sure to pick up the Special Edition and get the second disc of remixes, which were a bit of a disapopintment. But I’ll give it to Garbage, the songs collected for the greatest hits album were perfect.</li>
<li>The Donna’s, Bitchin’: The follow up to Gold Medal, this all girl band left their label and is publishing this independently. They’ve cranked the amps up to 11 for this album, and are rocking even harder. What I love about this album is the classic 80’s hair band feel The Donna’s bring. While not over the top, most songs are anthem rock songs without going too over the top. I highly recommend this album. (I have a friend who digs The Donna’s for the song Take it Off from the Gold Medal release, as he can play it on Guitar Hero).</li>
<li>White Light Riot, Atomism: This local band from Minneapolis has been getting some airplay on 89.3, and have an indie sound that’s a little harder than some of the current indie favorites out there, and a couple of the songs are pretty catchy. Due to some of the favorites above I haven’t listened to it as much as I’ve wanted, but I’ve been happy the few times so far that I have.</li>
<li>Bruce Springsteen, Magic: I was blown away by Radio Nowhere, the first single from the album, and unfortunately the rest of the album doesn’t sound like it. I’m a Springsteen fan though, and while the rest of the songs don’t rock as hard as that one as it mellows out a bit, the rest of the album is good. If you liked The Rising, you’ll like this release.</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to go buy the new Radiohead album off their website now. I’ve also been poking around Amazon’s store, and they are promising an album downloader for Linux. I’m really looking to give that a try. But more on physical vs. digital another time.</p>

            <description>I, like Phoronix, thought the Linux client was days away, but it’s weeks according to a post I saw on Linux-Gaming.net this morning:
 I’ve also been making steady progress with the Linux Client, and it’s coming along really well. We’ve been running a closed-beta test for ‘friends and family’ for a little while, and for the past couple of weeks have had a fully functional version of the demo running.</description>

<p>I’ve also been making steady progress with the Linux Client, and it’s coming along really well. We’ve been running a closed-beta test for ‘friends and family’ for a little while, and for the past couple of weeks have had a fully functional version of the demo running. The closed-beta testers are now able to play alongside Windows players on the same version, with full Punkbuster support. The major systems including the renderer and audio are working great, and performance has been good on both the NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards.</p>
<p>Alongside my other responsibilities at id, my focus now is on optimization for the Linux Client. If everything goes to plan, we should have the Linux Client ready for release in just a few weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read <a href="http://community.enemyterritory.com/index.php?q=node/168">TTimo’s full post here.</a></p>
<p>Darn. Well, I have tons of stuff to do with Foresight right now anyway, but it would have been fun to have some time to play before my new job starts in a couple weeks!</p>

            <description>I picked up a copy of Enemy Territory: Quake Wars.
Now I’m just playing the waiting game for the Linux binary so I can play it.
I think the actual game is more fun.
But I wanted to make a statement by picking up the game during release week – it’s important to me to support commercial game companies who make Linux compatible games.</description>

            <title>Rolling releases</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2007/10/rolling-releases/</link>

            <description>Over the next month or two, you may hear a lot of news about upcoming releases of various Linux distributions.
But what if you could do things differently? What if you could have a Linux distribution that wasn’t tied to a specific date twice a year to update your packages and your distribution? What if you wanted access to the latest Banshee for example that will be out later this year and not wait until next spring?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the next month or two, you may hear a lot of news about <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download">upcoming</a> <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DocsProject/Schedule">releases</a> of <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Roadmap">various</a> Linux distributions.</p>
<p>But what if you could do things differently? What if you could have a Linux distribution that wasn’t tied to a specific date twice a year to update your packages and your distribution? What if you wanted access to the latest Banshee for example that will be out later this year and not wait until next spring? Why mess around with backports or unstable respositories just to gain access to the latest release of a package that features a bug fix you need?</p>
<p>Try a Linux distribution that features a rolling release. Try <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org">Foresight Linux</a>. Yes, we have a “formal” release when GNOME releases every 6 months, but when a package has an update, it’s probably updated before you even notice, and just one conary updateall away from being included in your desktop. The latest packages will give you access to the latest features, and better yet, the latest bug fixes of any given package. With Foresight Linux 2.0 on the horizon, we will be adding a more formal QA process, so don’t let the “but we need months of testing” stop you from updating. Point releases come out every couple months, but mostly to update the downloadable media including install CDs / DVD and live media such as Live CDs or VMWare images. The magic of conary will keep all of your installed packages up to date.</p>
<p>Additionally, if something doesn’t work, Conary is an innovative package manager that features a rollback feature – from the command line type sudo conary rollback 1 and you’ll be right back to where you were before you installed that last package.</p>
<p>There can be better ways of doing things. And a rolling release <strong>is</strong> a better way.</p>

Take it from someone who had the same concerns and doubts about how you can help out – I’ve been using Linux for years, and knew I wanted to give back, and after I switched to Foresight this past spring, I found a core group of developers who were open and friendly, and welcomed me with any help I wanted to offer.</description>

<p>With Foresight Linux 2.0 in development, now is a great time to get involved. We are having a Developer meeting in IRC next Wednesday, October 3rd at 1:00 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>We are looking for help in all kinds of areas, and talking about forming some teams to tackle some of the outstanding projects – including documentation writing, packaging, bug triaging, development and a website redesign.</p>
<p>Come and listen, and maybe something will be discussed that you think you’d be good at lending a hand with. More information on the <a href="http://lists.rpath.org/mailman/listinfo/foresight-devel">foresight-developer mailing list</a> and on the <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/DEV/Developer+Meeting+-+Oct+3+2007">new Developer Meeting wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>

            <description>GNOME 2.20 is out and that means a formal release of Foresight Linux, 1.4, is out to go with it!
Why do I say “formal release of Foresight Linux”? Because of Conary, Foresight does rolling releases – whenever a package has a major update, you’ll get it right away, so you always have the latest bug fixes of your favorite software.
Here are the GNOME 2.20 Release Notes, Foresight 1.4 release announcement and release notes, and because it is International Talk Like a Pirate Day, the release notes done by our resident pirates.</description>

            <description>In almost 5 years of blogging, one of my cardinal rules, though unwritten, was to not talk about work and my job on this blog. You hear stories today about prospective employers doing Google searches on interviewees or looking them up on MySpace or Facebook. (Interesting sidenote: since converting my blog’s identity from silwenae to Paul Cutler, a Google Search of my name takes me to the #2 result on Google, up from about 10 6 months ago).</description>

You hear stories today about prospective employers doing Google searches on interviewees or looking them up on MySpace or Facebook. (Interesting sidenote: since converting my blog’s identity from silwenae to Paul Cutler, a Google Search of my name takes me to the #2 result on Google, up from about 10 6 months ago).</p>
<p>Rules are made to be broken.</p>
<p>After 15 years of working at <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com">Best Buy</a>, I resigned my position this morning. I believe it came as a surprise to most of my co-workers, who thought me a “lifer”. But this past year has been one of reflection for me, as January was my 10 year anniversary of working at the corporate office after 5 years in the retail stores, and May was my 15 year anniversary.</p>
<p>I’m not leaving retail behind forever, as I’m going to a small software publisher, who, well, publishes software to sell at retailers.</p>
<p>Best Buy has changed immensely since I’ve started. From 75 stores in 13 states, we now have 875 stores in 49 states in the US, as well as stores in Canada, China and operations in the U.K. I started as a part time cashier, and worked my way up the ladder managing my own store as a General Manager in 5 years. I then spent 10 years at the corporate office, holding positions as a Product Manager, Sr Buyer, and others working in Service, Business Development and lastly as a Merchant.</p>
<p>Change is hard, and a bit scary – Best Buy is really the only job and career I’ve had in my adult life. But I’m looking forward to the challenge of a new position, and in a way starting over. I’m going from a company of 120,000+ employees (5500 at our corporate office) to a company with 45 employees.</p>
<p>One of my co-workers who I have grown close to over the past few years left me a card and a CD with songs she thought was appropriate to me leaving. The song choices were amazing – and one of them was Tom Petty’s <em>Running Down a Dream</em>. I’ll post the set list in a few days.</p>
<p>I’m excited at the opportunity, and I’m looking forward to the change. And don’t worry, I’m back to my unwritten rule of not talking about work and my day job.</p>

            <description>My father and I were able to purchase season tickets again this year from a family member.
I spent this past Sunday driving to and from Lambeau Field (about 4.5 – 5 hours each way) and it was definitely worth it.
Prior to the game, there was a convention in Green Bay this past week hosting most living Congressional Medal of Honor recipients. Before the game, Brian Williams of NBC introduced, by war, those living Medal of Honor recipients who were able to attend the convention and game.</description>

<p>I spent this past Sunday driving to and from Lambeau Field (about 4.5 – 5 hours each way) and it was definitely worth it.</p>
<p>Prior to the game, there was a convention in Green Bay this past week hosting most living Congressional Medal of Honor recipients. Before the game, Brian Williams of NBC introduced, by war, those living Medal of Honor recipients who were able to attend the convention and game. The four living Wisconsin recipients were also honorary captains for the day. Prior to kickoff, four F-16s did a flyby.</p>
<p>Most of the drive to Green Bay once I hit Wisconsin was cloudy and rainy. Sure enough, the drizzle started at kickoff for 30 minutes, but by halftime the clouds parted and the sun was shining brightly.</p>
<p>The game was a nailbiter – after a 10-0 Packer start in the first quarter, I had visions of the Saints game from last year which I was at, where the Packers jumped to a large lead only to give it away. The defense was phenomenal, as was the special teams play. The offense, well, let’s just say they have their work cut out from them.</p>
<p>I brought my new Digital SLR (Canon Rebel XTi) to the game, but I ran out of battery by kick off as I was practicing taking photos with it during pre-game. It was the first time I’ve used the telescopic lens, which I was very impressed with when in Sports mode on the camera firing off 3 shots / second. I still have some learning to do on proper focusing when using that lens though. You can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/sets/72157601974324023/">view the set on Flickr here</a>, and here is one of my favorite pictures I took watching Favre warm up:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/1363108431/" title="Photo Sharing"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Next game: Sunday, October 9th against the Chicago Bears. This will be the first time I’ve seen the Bears at Lambeau, and is the only real rivalry the Packers have.</p>

            <description>As a Foresight user, I’m very excited about the future of PackageKit, which was highlighted in the August Foresight newsletter.
PackageKit will be a graphical front end for helping manage software packages on your computer, including installation, removal and updates.
Ken VanDine and Elliott Peele among others are hard at work getting Conary to work with PackageKit.
The new PackageKit website / wiki is up, and I just finished porting Richard’s Docbook documentation (that he blogged about this morning) for PackageKit to the wiki, available here.</description>

            <description>The shelving in my office closet came crashing down a couple of days ago. Lots of books, CDs, computer parts and boxes are currently strewn about my office. This picture doesn’t do the mess justice:

It’s been a long week between my hard drive crashing, the shelving ripped out of the wall, and my onging DirecTV nightmare, which I’ll expound upon once it’s over.</description>

            <description>I’m watching TV this past Sunday, streaming TV shows from my networked hard drive (a Buffalo Terrastation) to my Netgear EVA as my DirecTV is still out. I had noticed that when I hit play, it was taking a much longer time to start the show, but they started, and then halfway through one show it stopped, and couldn’t connect.
Walking into my office, all the lights on the Terrastation are flashing.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m watching TV this past Sunday, streaming TV shows from my networked hard drive (a <a href="http://www.terastation.org/wiki/Main_Page">Buffalo Terrastation</a>) to my <a href="http://www.netgear.com/Products/Entertainment/DigitalMediaPlayers/EVA8000.aspx">Netgear EVA</a> as my DirecTV is still out. I had noticed that when I hit play, it was taking a much longer time to start the show, but they started, and then halfway through one show it stopped, and couldn’t connect.</p>
<p>Walking into my office, all the lights on the Terrastation are flashing. The web interface came up, and the diagnostics report that one of the hard drives has failed.</p>
<p>Ack. Ugh. Many bad words I don’t want my children repeating.</p>
<p>A feeling of dread. Panic setting in – what isn’t backed up? What am I going to lose? What will my wife think?</p>
<p>I run some more diagnostics, generic drive failure messages. The Terrastation won’t give me status on the raid array because of the drive failure. Why, oh why was I running in drive spanning mode and not in a raid configuration where if a drive failed I’d still be ok?</p>
<p>The Terrastation has 4 160GB drives with the option of drive spanning, RAID 0, 1 or 5. Running a small version of Linux, which I always meant to hack with a custom firmware but never did for SSH access, it has FTP and Samba. I had Samba shares set up storing all my music, photos, videos and backup shares for both my wife and me. The Terrastation streams that content to my Netgear EVA at my home theater, the Sonos music players all over the house, and the hacked Xbox in the family room.</p>
<p>The lost data appears to be minimal – I have a full backup of my music on my desktop’s hard drive, and it looks like I have a copy of most of the photo’s, though I need to double check. Ironically, I lost most of the video’s I’ve downloaded since my DirecTV dish has been down, but that is what Bittorrent is for.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what was in the backup directories, I know I haven’t backed up much lately.</p>
<p>Now the question is – when is redundant backup not redundant enough? Do I want to take one of the extra computers I’m not using and install <a href="http://www.freenas.org/">FreeNAS</a> or <a href="http://www.openfiler.com/">Openfiler</a>? My good friend Mr. Holzer recently built a FreeNAS server using compactflash to boot the OS with a bunch of hard drives. The price of external drives keeps falling as well, do I want to just be lazy and buy another one of those?</p>
<p>I hate that feeling of dread – I’ve lost my personal music collection and had to re-rip it at least 3 times now. I know hard drives don’t last forever, and I’d rather be safe than sorry.</p>

            <description>I haven’t blogged much in August, and here it is at month end already. Things should be settling down soon (I hope) leaving me more to blog and get back to work on Foresight.
I had a couple trips in August, lots of stuff going on at work, and we’re looking at building a new house, so the month just flew by.
The storm two days ago knocked my DirecTV dish out of alignment – not having TV for a week should free up some time.</description>

<p>The storm two days ago knocked my DirecTV dish out of alignment – not having TV for a week should free up some time. More on that later, but at least I have HD off air so I can watch the (7th ranked!) Badgers kick off the the college football season tomorrow.</p>
<p>I’m also in the process of transferring all my websites to a new server, so that’s eaten up some time. I spent almost a weekend working on getting apatheia.org moved from my account to a friends who is paying for it now.</p>
<p>More to come soon.</p>

            <description>There is a small chance my website might temporarily go offline for the next week or two. I’ve been working with Site5 to transfer servers and downgrade my services, but communication has been spotty. Unfortunately, my account is technically up this week, and as luck would have it, I will be traveling when that occurs.
If that happens, and my account isn’t extended, I won’t be able to deal with it as I’m traveling for work later in the work.</description>

            <description>With all the good news coming out of QuakeCon this weekend (Enemy Territory, Rage, Q3 in a browser!), there was one point of disappointing news for me as a fan if id Software: id has partnered with Valve to deploy their titles on Steam.
Valve has already publicly stated it has no plans for Steam on Linux. Being former Microsoft developers, who is surprised? But id has always been a cross-platform development company and it’s disappointing to see them partner with Valve on this.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With all the good news coming out of QuakeCon this weekend (<a href="http://www.shacknews.com/screenshots.x?gallery=8038&amp;game_id=4052&amp;id=103131">Enemy Territory</a>, <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48300">Rage</a>, <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48290">Q3 in a browser</a>!), there was one point of disappointing news for me as a fan if id Software: id has partnered with Valve to <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48288">deploy their titles on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Valve has <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=276761&amp;page=111">already publicly stated</a> it has no plans for Steam on Linux. Being former Microsoft developers, who is surprised? But id has always been a cross-platform development company and it’s disappointing to see them partner with Valve on this. But I can’t really blame them, as they deserve kudos for monetizing their catalog titles, and the price point is amazing – $70 for all id titles up to and including Doom3 and it’s expansion. That’s amazing – play all their games from Commander Keen to Quake to Doom3. (Yes, I know I’m talking out of both sides of my mouth.)</p>
<p>Now the bad news – it appears that Valve is using DOSBox to make id’s older games playable, which is GPL, without including specific files, such as COPYING.TXT which makes this violate the GPL.</p>
<p>I saw the <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/05/1951243">original story on Slashdot</a>, and it’s an interesting tale of two communities. The <a href="http://www.halflife2.net/forums/showthread.php?t=128297">HalfLife2.net forums</a> quickly degenerate into mudslinging, especially on pages 4-7, with one user going so far as to, well, read for yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>****ing ridiculous. I don’t know how some of you can brush this off as a mere ‘molehill’ or misunderstanding. You Valve and ID apologists sicken me.</p>
<p>The GPL is essentially the word of God, look at it as the 13th commandment: Thou Shalt Distribute The Source And Any Chamges Made Unto It To All Those Who Ask. When God created Adam and Eve he made it such that when they procreate, each of them combine to make the new item and the source modification is passed on down the generations. It is no co-incidence that Richard Stallman appears as we envisage God to appear for he is a true prophet of our time, a visionary who is putting Gods voice into the digital age.</p>
<p>The fact that these heathens dared ignore Gods word and packaged the games without copying.txt is absolutely unforgivable. They will surely rot for eternity in hell as no doubt you who support them will too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…Which is an interesting take on the GPL that I haven’t necessary seen before. I’ve heard of GNU zealots, but this might take the cake.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/news.php?show_news=1">DOSBox</a> <a href="http://vogons.zetafleet.com/viewtopic.php?t=16285&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0&amp;sid=d549b81b15bcacdd79d9438acf2b1df2">forums are a contrast</a> in civility and logic. Instead of Valve bashing and zealotry, DOSBox developers call out the exceptions, and update the thread when Valve does something good, such as adding back the COPYING.TXT file via Steam. The developers seem understanding of the situation so far, and while major questions remain around distributing the source of Valve’s changes, the DOSBox team seem to be taking a wait an see approach.</p>
<p>John Carmack, id’s lead developer and co-owner, has always been a friend of the GPL – he has led the open sourcing of most prior games once the licensees are done using them, resulting in successes such as <a href="http://icculus.org/news/news.php?id=3966">ioquake3</a>. I’m hopeful this will all be resolved in a good way. And I still wish Valve would put a Steam client on Linux (and OSX) too.</p>

            <description>My favorite time of the year is quickly approaching, as we are just over a month away from the start of the college football season, and the NFL is now in full swing with training camps.
I’ve started to watch a few baseball games this year (especially when the Twins are on in HD), but nothing compares to football for me.

<p>I’ve started to watch a few baseball games this year (especially when the Twins are on in HD), but nothing compares to football for me.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see last night that the newly formed Big Ten Network that launches Aug. 30th, will be included on the basic tier of DirecTV. And here I was already to shell out $10 / month for the sports package. I’m glad I don’t, as NFL Ticket just hit my bill. I’ll be interested to see how much HD bandwidth the Big Ten Network gets, as they keep talking about how they’re launching with the most HD content of any new TV channel. DirecTV’s new satellite doesn’t come online until October with more HD capacity, so this will be interesting to see.</p>
<p>In related news, I’ve gotten my hands on a few Packer tickets this year – I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to see Favre play knowing this is probably his last year. (But we say that every year, don’t we?)</p>
<p>10 days until the first preseason game! Are <em><strong>you</strong></em> ready for some football?</p>

            <title>Foresight Newsletter Issue 5 Released</title>

            <description>The July newsletter is officially out the door. (And I need to stop waiting until the last day of the month to publish and give the translators time to translate).
This month we take a look at the new logo (!), the 2.0 release schedule (one of the more commonly asked questions in IRC), installing packages from rPath repositories outside the default Foresight repositories (yes, people, if you have to, you can install Amarok, but why?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/newsletter/2007/08/01/">July newsletter</a> is officially out the door. (And I need to stop waiting until the last day of the month to publish and give the translators time to translate).</p>
<p>This month we take a look at the new logo (!), the 2.0 release schedule (one of the more commonly asked questions in IRC), installing packages from rPath repositories outside the default Foresight repositories (yes, people, if you have to, you can install Amarok, but why?!) and one of pscott’s and my favorite pieces of eye candy, <a href="https://launchpad.net/awn">Avant Window Navigator</a>. And more!</p>
<p>I really enjoyed writing the AWN howto – it is the first package featured in the newsletter that is not installed by default in Foresight. It was also nice to publish the upcoming 2.0 release schedule publically. It makes the 2.0 release feel more tangible, and puts a stake in the ground we can all work to.</p>
<p>I’m also looking for help in writing the newsletter – anything! Feature a package, a howto, you name it. Help in the wiki or email me stuff and I’ll collaborate on it. This isn’t a one man show. <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/newsletter/2007/08/01/">Read it here</a> and don’t forget you can also subscribe to the feed in your favorite feedreader, just add <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/foresightnewsletter">http://feeds.feedburner.com/foresightnewsletter</a></p>
<p>And thanks for reading the newsletter! Enjoy!</p>

            <description>Reading the article “Mepis to switch from Ubuntu to Debian” one thing jumped out at me:
 Woodford explained that Ubuntu is rebuilt almost from scratch every six months using source packages from Debian EXPERIMENTAL.
 In using Ubuntu for almost 3 years, that was my experience as well. I formatted and installed fresh more than I just did a apt-get dist-upgrade.
And that is one of the major features of Conary – managing your applications and dependencies so you should never have to “install fresh”.</description>

<p>(Click through to Flickr for larger versions, and note the Calculus books making a monitor stand on the 22″ monitor on the right).</p>
<p>A Dell 2405 is on the left with a default resolution of 1920×1200, a Samsung 213T is on the right running 1600×1200, both powered by a single BFG Nvidia 7950GT with the Nvidia propietary drivers on Foresight Linux. This gives me a default resolution of 3560×1200. Here’s a screenshot, click through to see a larger version on Flickr:</p>

<p>It was easier than I expected – looking at a couple seach results in Google showed me how to add to my xorg.conf to set this up.</p>
<p>I added a second monitor section in my xorg.conf with the Samsung information. I then added the following lines in the Section “Screen”:</p>
<pre><code>    `Option 		&quot;TwinView&quot; &quot;Yes&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
    Option 		&quot;SecondMonitorVertRefresh&quot; &quot;39-85&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Option 		&quot;SecondMonitorHorizSync&quot; &quot;29-81&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
    Option 		&quot;MetaModes&quot; &quot;1920x1200,1600x1200&quot;`
</code></pre>
<p>I restarted X, and voila.</p>

            <description>I stopped by my buddy’s place last night and put my ET: Quake Wars beta key to use on one of his Windows boxes. After downloading the client, I hopped in to a random ET:QW running about 8 on 8.
One word sums it up: Fast. It’s Quake3 / Quake4 fast. I’ve always thought and heard that Q3 was considered faster than UT2k4, and if that’s true, than Battlefield 2 is molasses.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I stopped by my buddy’s place last night and put my <a href="http://www.enemyterritory.com/main.html">ET: Quake Wars</a> beta key to use on one of his Windows boxes. After downloading the client, I hopped in to a random ET:QW running about 8 on 8.</p>
<p>One word sums it up: Fast. It’s Quake3 / Quake4 fast. I’ve always thought and heard that Q3 was considered faster than UT2k4, and if that’s true, than Battlefield 2 is molasses.</p>
<p>There is only one map for the beta, and it feels a lot like the Assault mode on UT2k4 with timed objectives. I played human (GDF), and we were the attacking force. Once you met your objective, your spawn point became that forward way point, and the Strogg’s objective was to keep us from moving forward.</p>
<p>I played almost all of the classes, and in the 90 minutes I played, it was hard to form an opinion, but due to the speed of the game and the respawn, I was mostly assault, playing all 3 classes with the assault rifle, heavy machine gun and rocket launcher.</p>
<p>I tried Medic out briefly, and due to the speed and chaos, it was pretty easy to rack up some experience bringing back soldiers from the dead.</p>
<p>Speaking of dying and respawn, respawn is fast. Twenty seconds tops, on average about ten seconds before all the dead soldiers are re-deployed as a group at the most recent objective / spawnpoint.</p>
<p>I intuitively understood the layout and the icon structure, but feedback from my friends has been they’ve struggled with that so far. I don’t know if it’s the fact that I’ve been reading the fan sites off and on over the past few months and had a clue what to expect, but I was able to navigate the map and the objectives fairly easily.</p>
<p>You get experience based on kills, but more based on choosing an objective out of a few available, and then completing it. I was promoted to Soldier during one run where I had the rocket launcher, and my upgrade was that the lock-on for the rocket launcher went from about 7 seconds to 2. So there is definitely an advantage in going after the objectives than just randomly kililng people.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the maps at release are bigger, which reduces the speed and chaos, as it will give you and your fireteam (squad) a chance to get organized and go in together. The game also needs voicechat, you can’t keep up with the text on the screen with the speed of the game.</p>
<p>I’m going to need to play this a few more times – with UT2k7 on the horizon, I’m not sold on ET:QW as much as I was, just based on how fast the game was moving. I want my squad to move together as a team, not just keep rushing like lemmings against the objective.</p>
<p>Truth is, I’ll buy it to support gaming on Linux, but my first impression was cautious optimism. I may play a rounds of ET: Wolfenstein this weekend just to compare how fast the gameplay was in the orignial.</p>
<p>In related news, Michael Larabel of Phoronix <a href="http://www.michaellarabel.com/?k=blog&amp;i=263">notes that ET:QW has been delayed again</a>, this time until Sept. 3rd.</p>

            <description>(Said in a Dalek voice:)
Innovate! Innovate! Innovate! Innovate!
GUADEC, the annual GNOME user and developer conference, is in full swing in England right now. One of my favorite times of the year as a GNOME user, all the GNOME developers get together and blog about all the cool stuff they’re working on, or want to be working on.
I continue to be personally excited about Havoc’s vision for enabling an online desktop.</description>

<p>Innovate! Innovate! Innovate! Innovate!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guadec.org/">GUADEC</a>, the annual GNOME user and developer conference, is in full swing in England right now. One of my favorite times of the year as a GNOME user, all the GNOME developers get together and blog about all the cool stuff they’re working on, or want to be working on.</p>
<p>I continue to be personally excited about Havoc’s vision for enabling an online desktop. This isn’t the first time he’s discussed this, or I’ve blogged about. First, go read the <a href="http://ometer.com/presentations/OnlineDesktop072007v6.pdf">keynote presentation</a> from GUADEC. I strongly agree with this vision of the future, and get excited just thinking about it.</p>
<p>Havoc’s blog links to a new wiki page for the <a href="http://online-desktop.org/wiki/Online_Desktop">Online Desktop</a>. Right now, it’s one simple page covering the philosophy, and hosting the presentation and screencast mockups. (This is a small thing, but what I like about this wiki page is that it’s GNOME branded. This isn’t a Red Hat thing – this is a thing that all GNOME users and developers should give some thought to, tying back to the GNOME 3.0 / Project Topaz discussions).</p>
<p>Havoc’s <a href="http://log.ometer.com/2007-07.html#18">expounds on the keynote in his blog</a>. He shares his high level thoughts around the privacy issue, data hosting, and proprietary nature of some of the web services users would want to use. Well worth a read.</p>
<p>I’m enjoying the other GUADEC updates via Planet GNOME, and I thought the <a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/temp/guadec-multiuser.pdf">Multi-user Desktop presentation</a> was well worth the read.</p>
<p>I need to continue to be more active in GNOME, and one of these years attend GUADEC.</p>

            <description>A few months ago, I tried out Epiphany for 60 days after a particularily nasty Firefox crash caused me to lose a lot of content I was working on in a wiki page. At the end of the 60 days, I was pretty happy with Epiphany, and impressed with the developers in how they integrated Epiphany in to the GNOME desktop.

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, I tried out Epiphany for 60 days after a particularily nasty Firefox crash caused me to lose a lot of content I was working on in a wiki page. At the end of the 60 days, I was pretty happy with Epiphany, and impressed with the developers in how they integrated Epiphany in to the GNOME desktop.</p>
<p>However, a few things had me coming back to Firefox:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have to use WindowsXP at work, and I use Firefox there. I love the <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/">Google Sync extension</a> for sharing my history, cookies and bookmarks between my work computer and my two home computers.</li>
<li>Extensions: I love the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1320">Gmail Manger</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extension">del.icio.us</a> extensions. By far, the most useful two extensions I”ve come across.</li>
<li>Epiphany’s default behavior for opening a new tab drives me crazy, as it opens Google, and the cursor sits in the Google search box instead of the URL field to type a new webpage address in to.</li>
<li>And this is very minor, but Mugshot was opening in Firefox by default.</li>
<li>Epiphany would always open in a new window, not a new tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>After I switched back to Firefox a few weeks ago, it was just eating up too much memory and CPU cycles. Firefox then began pausing while using it when the CPU / memory use would spike, which drove me crazy, so I went back to Epiphany’s waiting arms one more time.</p>
<p>Since I have switched back, I have also invested some time in customizing Epiphany:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the default home page to blank fixes the focus issue I had on the URI line, since Google is no longer the home page, it doesn’t default to the Google search box. <a href="http://www.ctaf.free.fr/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=epiphany">This plugin</a> does a similar thing as well.</li>
<li>Based on the screenshot below, you can see I’ve added an extra toolbar. Within that toolbar, I’ve added the “Post to del.icio.us” link since the Epilicious plugin is currently broken, which you can get from the del.icio.us home page. I’ve also added 3 search boxes:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Google: Add a new bookmark when you’re at Google.com, and then add %s to the end so it looks like this: <a href="http://www.google.com/%25s">http://www.google.com/%s</a> Then View Bookmarks, and drag that bookmark to your toolbar.</li>
<li>JIRA: Search the Foresight issue / bug tracker from your toolbar: <a href="http://issues.foresightlinux.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa/%25s">http://issues.foresightlinux.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa/%s</a> (I may have a typo, I have issues with this one).</li>
<li>Search rBuilder / Foresight to see if a certain package is maintained on rBuilder: <a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/search?type=Packages;search=%25s&amp;#8221;">http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/search?type=Packages;search=%s&amp;#8221;</a> Great for when folks stop by in IRC looking for a package, and you can tell them to use Conary to install if it’s there.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you go to System &gt; Preferences &gt; Preferred Applications and have Epiphany chosen as your default web browser, and then click on the radio button for “Open link in new tab”. If you have Epiphany, and click on a Mugshot link for example, it will open in Epiphany. Unfortunately, I haven’t found an extension yet to have links in your web browser always open in a tab, ala <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/158">Tabbrowser Preferences for Firefox</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>One ongoing complaint, is the dialog box to remember passwords doesn’t work if I type “R” – I can only use the mouse, even when the dialog box has focus.</p>
<p>The last complaint I have is that the Epilicious and Gmail Notifier plugins are currently broken. I’m a del.icio.us and Gmail junkie, and those are almost enough for me to go back to Firefox, but I’ll manage manually.</p>
<p>If you haven’t tried out Epipany, take the challenge. Give up your other browser for 30 days, and with a few exceptions, Epiphany as just as good any other browser out there, and it integrates with your GNOME experience that much better. I’m dedicated to using Epiphany, and here is my obligatory screenshot (click through to Flickr to see larger sizes):</p>

            <description>Neil Patel upated his blog with news that Avant Window Navigator, everyone’s favorite dock-like menu bar for GNOME, now had reflections enabled (and some bug fixes) in the latest subversion thanks to some contributors.
Pscott was kind enough to package it within minutes of being pinged in IRC, a simple conary update avant-window-navigator and voila, new AWN. (See, don’t you wish you were running Foresight right now?)
Here is a picture of my dock taken just minutes ago with the new AWN from subversion:</description>

<p>Pscott was kind enough to package it within minutes of being pinged in IRC, a simple conary update avant-window-navigator and voila, new AWN. (See, don’t you wish you were running <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org">Foresight</a> right now?)</p>
<p>Here is a picture of my dock taken just minutes ago with the new AWN from subversion:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/824217632/" title="Photo Sharing"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Changing AWN to use reflections and have the icons sit on top of the bar does require two changes in Gconf, it’s not in the AWN preferences yet. This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfzKJu70U14&amp;mode=related&amp;search=">Youtube click shows you how</a>, or just do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Gconf (Applicatons &gt; System Tools &gt; Configuration Editor)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on Apps &gt; Avant-Window-Navigator &gt; Bar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the Bar_angle value to 30</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the Icon_offset value to 10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close Gconf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restart Avant-Window-Navigator (Right click on it (not on an icon!) and click Close. Hit ALT-F2 to run it, and type avant-window-naviagor to start it. Voila!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks again to the fine developers, and to Pscott for packaging it so quickly. It’s the little things that keep me happy, like eye candy.</p>
<p>_Update: Thanks to Cornelius in the comments, these settings make the reflection much more apparent:</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>bar_angle: 45</p>
<p>icon_offset: 18</p>

            <description>I haven’t been a huge fan of Comcast since we were switched over from Time Warner last year. They jacked prices up 30%, and have horrible customer service, but the quality of service of the broadband connection has maintained.
I recently switched to a commercial account recently through an accomodation program at work, so I’m getting better upload and download speeds, for about 15% cheaper than my previous bill.
The speed tests were interesting, why couldn’t I have had this kind of speed 7 or 8 years ago when I was running a Counter-Strike server?</description>

            <description>I received an email from Phil Dibowitz two days ago regarding his work on trying to get the Harmony 880 remote working on Linux. He had seen a blog post from late last year where I had added on to Aaron Bockover’s bounty to get Harmony support working.
Ironically enough after responding to his email, I went through my morning routine of checking the news on the ‘net while I ate breakfast, and saw the same story on Digg (linking here), and now a few hours later, Phoronix has picked up the story as well.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I received an email from Phil Dibowitz two days ago regarding his work on trying to get the <a href="http://www.phildev.net/phil/blog/index.php?title=writing_a_linux_driver_for_harmony_remot&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">Harmony 880 remote working on Linux</a>. He had seen a <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=600">blog post from late last year</a> where I had added on to Aaron Bockover’s bounty to get Harmony support working.</p>
<p>Ironically enough after responding to his email, I went through my morning routine of checking the news on the ‘net while I ate breakfast, and saw the same <a href="http://www.digg.com/linux_unix/Logitech_gives_Linux_users_the_finger">story on Digg</a> (linking here), and now a few hours later, <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=NTg3Mw">Phoronix has picked up the story</a> as well.</p>
<p>I would like to post one correction to the stories I’m seeing: this was originally <a href="http://abock.org/2006/12/13/harmony-880-remote-on-linux/">Aaron Bockover’s idea</a>. <a href="http://abock.org">Aaron</a> is a Linux developer and maintainer of <a href="http://www.banshee-project.org">Banshee</a>, everyone’s favorite music manager for the GNOME desktop.</p>
<p>I’m excited to see all the interest in getting Harmony remotes working on Linux, and take Phil’s advice: <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/support_downloads/">give Logitech constructive feedback</a> that we want to see support on Linux.</p>

            <description>Will Farrington has created a wonderful plugin that controls Banshee from within X-Chat-GNOME. And thanks to Ken for packaging it so quickly.
It looks and sounds so simple, but it’s fun to play with. I absolutely love Banshee (and am so excited about all the Banshee news this week), and I spen a lot of time in IRC. It’s like peanut butter and chocolate, they just go together.
If you’re running Foresight, just do the following:</description>

            <description>For my first day of vacation, I took Alex and Zoe to the Twins game at the Metrodome. It was Alex’s first Twins game, and Zoe’s first baseball game as we watched the Twins take on the Blue Jays. We had the use of a suite, just to the left behind home plate, with a gorgeous view of the field:

Zoe and Alex seemed to have fun, Zoe enjoyed being able to run around the suite, and both kids enjoyed all the foods and snacks.</description>

<p>(My batteries were low, so I don’t think the flash worked).</p>
<p>After the baseball strike in the early 90’s, I swore off all baseball. It wasn’t until last year where I started to have an interest again, mostly due to the Twins being such a quality organization, both in management and the players. They play baseball as it was meant to be played, as a team, without ego, and truly appear to have fun. That has translated in to 4 AL Central Division championships in the last 5 years, and I’ve found myself watching a lot of games this year. It doesn’t change the fact the Metrodome is a terrible baseball experience – baseball should always be played outdoors!</p>
<p>The game started out rough, with Frank Thomas basting a 3 run homer in the first inning to give the Blue Jays a 4 – 0 lead. It was Frank Thomas’ 500th home run, as he became only the 21st player in MLB history to achieve that milestone, and the Twins fans rewarded him with a standing ovation. The Twins scraped an clawed led by Torii Hunter’s two home runs to take the lead with a nice come from behind win.</p>

            <description>Today is the 10th anniversary of the landmark Reno vs. ACLU decision, which set the course for free speech on the internet.
From the EFF:
 Tuesday marks the ten year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Courts landmark decision in Reno v. ACLU, which recognized that free speech on the Internet merits the highest standards of Constitutional protection. EFF participated as both plaintiff and co-counsel in the case, which successfully challenged the online censorship provisions of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is the 10th anniversary of the landmark <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005335.php">Reno vs. ACLU</a> decision, which set the course for free speech on the internet.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tuesday marks the ten year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Courts landmark <a href="http://www.eff.org/legal/cases/EFF_ACLU_v_DoJ/19970626_cda.decision">decision</a> in <em>Reno v. ACLU</em>, which recognized that free speech on the Internet merits the highest standards of Constitutional protection. EFF participated as both plaintiff and co-counsel in the case, which successfully challenged the online censorship provisions of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996. The Courts decision — its first involving the Internet — was issued on June 26, 1997.</p>
<p>The CDA fight was one of the first big rallying points for online freedom. When the law passed, thousands of websites <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.05/scans.html">turned their backgrounds black</a> in protest. EFF launched its <a href="http://www.eff.org/br/#brsite">“blue ribbon”</a> campaign and millions of websites around the world joined in support of free speech online. Even today, you can find the blue ribbon <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link:http://www.eff.org/br">throughout the Web.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Blue Ribbon campaign was the first introduction I had to the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> – I remember the day the web turned black to fight the CDA, and I remember putting a Blue Ribbon on one of the first very basic websites I created.</p>
<p>Ten years later, I am still a believer and supporter of the EFF – wearing their swag, blogging their causes, and <a href="http://www.eff.org/support">supporting them financially</a> by having become a Pioneer level contributor for the last 5 years.</p>
<p>The EFF supports many different worthy causes, including: fighting for free speech, fair use (including fighting the broadcast flag), illegal spying, and anonymity.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the fine folks at the EFF for all their hard work.</p>

            <description>After a handful of hours sleep, we made it back to BarcampChicago on Sunday.
The crowd had definitely thinned out compared to Sunday, but there were still quite a number of folks there.
Ken’s first talk on installing a MythTV appliance was great. There is so much buzz and interest in the community around virtualization and appliances, and Ken’s talk and the live demo of installing the appliance went over well.</description>

<p>The crowd had definitely thinned out compared to Sunday, but there were still quite a number of folks there.</p>
<p>Ken’s first talk on installing a MythTV appliance was great. There is so much buzz and interest in the community around virtualization and appliances, and Ken’s talk and the live demo of installing the appliance went over well.</p>
<p>After a brief juggling of the schedule, and a little swearing at the projectors, Ken kicked off the Foresight presentation. We had put the presentation together on Saturday, and I’ll get a copy posted to the website this week. I was mostly watching the crowd’s reaction and listening to questions. I want to take a snapshot of the current presentation, and then work on version 2. There were lots of questions about Conary, and later, rPath, that would be good to address in the next version. The presentation provides an overview of why Foresight was created and it’s purpose, an overview of the innovative applications included, and where Foresight is headed in the future.</p>
<p>A brief while later, we had a small get together on kicking off the first US based GNOME Usergroup in Chicago. Kevin Hariss did a great job in sharing his passion for GNOME, and shared some ideas on what a GNOME Usergroup could hope to accomplish, and next steps for the group. I’ll throw up a post in the next day or too with some additional details and the meeting notes.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, I took off, grabbed a Chicago style hot dog at a local restaurant, and took the train to O’Hare where I promptly took a nap on the flight home.</p>
<p>A big shout out to the Chicago BarCamp organizers, the event was a blast. I’ve finished uploading the photos I took from Saturday and Sunday, here’s the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/sets/72157600452329603/">set on Flickr</a>. A big thanks to Kevin for hosting Ken and I, and thanks to Ken and Kevin for all the great Foresight discussion. I was excited about Foresight before, and now I can’t even put it into words.</p>

            <description>Today is the 25th anniversary of Bladerunner. To celebrate, I’m off to watch the movie on the big TV with my laptop in tow to get some work done.
I was only 9 when this was released, but I still vividly remember seeing the re-release in 1992 at the Oriental Theater in Milwaukee when the Director’s Cut was released. I love everything about this movie, and can’t wait for the box set later this year.</description>

I’ve read The Man in the High Castle and The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch so far. I’m looking forward to Ubik and re-reading Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, the story Bladerunner is based on.</p>

            <description>I’m standing in Chicago last night (just after eating at a Chicago-style hot dog place, one of my favorite things to eat, but I digress) waiting for the train to take me to the airport when I get a call from a good friend informing me that Quake Wars beta keys were available.
Linux Games has an update from Timothee Besset at iD regarding the Linux client and lack of beta:</description>

<p><a href="http://www.linuxgames.com/news/feedback.php?identiferID=9261&amp;action=flatview">Linux Games</a> has an <a href="http://community.enemyterritory.com/forums/showthread.php?p=63146#post63146">update from Timothee Besset</a> at iD regarding the Linux client and lack of beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t want to commit to any schedule for the ETQW Linux client at this point. Most of my time is spent working on the game itself, on the Linux dedicated server and on the network infrastructure.</p>
<p>Once those things wind down (in the upcoming weeks) I will start working specifically on the client. But fear not, ATI and NVidia have expressed interest in getting a Linux client early, so they can review how it performs and get their drivers adjusted. When we release, we’ll release a high quality product, just like we do on Windows.</p>
<p>In any case, don’t expect to find Linux binaries on the retail DVD. It’s hard enough for everyone to get gold masters done, there are enough things to check and worry about, I will not place additional strain on the procedure by trying to squeeze my additional set of files on there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have my key, looks like I’ll have play the beta at a buddies house for now. September can’t come fast enough for when I can play at home.</p>

            <description>The latest GNOME Journal was published today. Articles include:
 Fun with Gstreamer Audio Effects Exercising Your Application With Accerciser GNOME.conf.au 2007 Wrap-up  And most importantly, my first contribution GNOME Journal,
Creating the GNOME 2.18 Live Media: An interview with Ken VanDine. Hopefully, this will be the first of many articles I hope to write in the future.
I don’t know if I’ve ever told this story, but I first met Ken last February when I was trying to figure out how to build a new GNOME LiveCD.</description>

<p>I don’t know if I’ve ever told this story, but I first met Ken last February when I was trying to figure out how to build a new GNOME LiveCD. Dave Neary pointed me at Ken at one point, who was already working on this as well. After talking to Ken, he was lightyears ahead of my struggles as he was using the rPath toolset, which enabled him to quickly publish a GNOME 2.18 LiveCD. I helped out with the easy stuff, editing the LGO pages for Live Media, and the PGO page which was later committed.</p>
<p>Ken was so welcoming to the help, I gave Foresight Linux a try as he is the founder and lead developer. I had just installed it when I started the interview, and by the time the interview was done a month later, I was helping out Foresight with docs and website updates and other little stuff.</p>
<p>Three or four months later here we are, and I’m still going strong helping out, and I enjoy the Foresight community as much today as the first time I asked a question in IRC. I hope you enjoy the article as much as I enjoyed working with Ken writing it.</p>

            <description>We’re back at Barcamp as of just after noon after 4 hours of sleep. We’re surprisingly awake and ready to go. We had a small hicuup trying to download the images needed for today’s Conary talk, but SpecialKevin bailed us out.
Ken is on in 10 minutes – the first talk is on Conary, and he will be demonstrating a MythTV appliance. (I’m so excited – I’m on vacation as of Thursday, and one of my projects over vacation is to get my MythTV box up and running finally.</description>

<p>Ken then continues on for another hour at 2:00 CST with the Foresight presentation. The day’s a little in flux, so we might push it back as people are still trickling in (we were up late….). And then at 3, the first US based GNOME usergroup meeting, a brainstorming session with SpecialKevin.</p>
<p>More to come soon!</p>

            <description>Barcamp Chicago has been a blast. Saturday’s turnout was phenomenal – I would hazard a guess we had 200 people at one point. The formal presentation was always packed, and mini-sessions were going on all around.
There hasn’t been a lot of hacking per se, but lots of active discussions about everything from road trips to Linux distributions to brewing (and trying!) home brewed beer. I could have done some more networking, but overall, I am having a blast.</description>

<p>Unfortunately, my camera isn’t working on my PC or Ken’s – I’m getting USB errors when trying to import the photos, so those will have to wait until I get home to a card reader.</p>
<p>Ken’s been a big hit – lots of folks who have not only heard of Conary, but wanted to learn more, and he’s been in his environment talking away, and his passion and excitement has rubbed off on everyone around him.</p>
<p>We got back to the hotel around 5 a.m., so to say it was a fun-filled day, was an understatement.</p>

            <description>I made it to Barcamp Chicago successfully, Kevin and Ken were waiting at the terminal. Took the train to the hotel, unpacked, and took the train to Barcamp, and here we are!
The location itself is pretty cool – 3rd floor office loft, with lots of space. We’re currently hanging around the area that will be used later for the Installfest, and presentations are already going on. The formal presentation room is curtained off, with tons of chairs, that I doubt will be enough.</description>

<p>We walked in and setup, and shortly after a couple Google guys showed up with tons of snacks and even more beer to add to the existing 2 kegs – nothing like helping out hauling all that stuff up 3 flights of stairs!</p>
<p>I’ve started a set on Flickr of the photos I’m taking here at Barcamp. I’ll also be using Twitter for small updates, in addition to live blogging, so it can be just like you’re here!</p>
<p>The Foresight, Conary and GNOME usergroup meetings are all tomorrow afternoon, so we have some time to setup, kick back and meet some folks.</p>
<p>Here’s a picture of Ken working on the Installfest PXE Server, enjoy:</p>

            <description>Gizmodo covers what’s been on my mind since it was announced Apple’s iPhone partner was AT&amp;amp;T: the moral quandary of doing business with AT&amp;amp;T.:
 So what we have is a company that doesn’t have privacy at the top of its priority list, not to mention the anti-trust laws of this country. It’s setting terrible precedents left and right, and its vast power that comes from its huge size makes it all the more unlikely to change for the better.</description>

            <description>As a long time Red Hat stockholder, let me say thank you to Red Hat’s leadership for flatly rejecting Microsoft’s overtures for interoperability and protection from patent suits. From the Yahoo! News article:
 Microsoft made its intentions clear on Friday: It wants to work out a cross-licensing deal with the largest Linux vendor on the market that would look much the same as its recent agreements with Xandros and Linspire.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=RHT&amp;t=5y&amp;l=on&amp;z=m&amp;q=l&amp;c=">long time</a> Red Hat stockholder, let me say thank you to Red Hat’s leadership for <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nf/53140;_ylt=AotoSKRI8Ukcxl_7Oom1Az0DW7oF">flatly rejecting Microsoft’s overtures</a> for interoperability and protection from patent suits. From the Yahoo! News article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft made its intentions clear on Friday: It wants to work out a cross-licensing deal with the largest Linux vendor on the market that would look much the same as its recent agreements with Xandros and Linspire.</p>
<p>Red Hat quickly dashed all hopes, standing on its previous statements from last November, issued in the wake of the controversial Novell deal. Red Hat left no room for misinterpretation when it said the company would not compromise on its open-source roots.</p>
<p>“An innovation tax is unthinkable,” the company said in a statement. “Free and open-source software provide the necessary environment for true innovation. Innovation without fear or threat. Activities that isolate communities or limit upstream adoption will inevitably stifle innovation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To Red Hat, Ubuntu and all the others in the future who reject this deal: Thank you.</p>

<p>I was traveling for most of the week for my day job, but I did a little writing after last weeks post, then a flurry of activity Friday and Saturday. Last week, I was mostly content complete, with tons of formatting left to complete in almost every document, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linking all URLs</li>
<li>Fixing all bullet points</li>
<li>Adding arrows to directions for clicking in the menu</li>
<li>Fixing the indentation errors</li>
<li>Resizing all screenshots to 510 pixels wide</li>
</ul>
<p>The above items were almost all completed Friday, but I still hadn’t started the biggest challenge, which was writing a Table of Contents. Looking through the source code of various other Yelp / Docbook files, I had seen a number of pages calling other Docbook pages, such as the GNOME Documentation Project Handbook, for inclusion using this tag:</p>
<p><code>[include href=&quot;filename.xml&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude&quot;/]</code></p>
<p>In the end, I ended up using the ENTITY tag, as found in the GNOME Documentation Style Guide, which consists of listing all the files in alphabetical order at the top, and then calling each one in the order you want within the <code>[book]</code> tag:</p>
<p><code>[!ENTITY APPLICATIONS SYSTEM &quot;applications.xml&quot;]</code></p>
<p><code>&amp;APPLICATIONS;</code></p>
<p>I borrowed heavily from the GNOME Documentation Style Guide’s structure and code, in writing the default page (foresight-user-guide.xml) and create a Preface chapter. This chapter is new as of yesterday, and includes an “About” section, “What’s in this Guide” with links to each Chapter and it’s summary, and a “Who Should Read this Guide” which breaks out by chapter for new or experienced Linux users the chapters they might find the most relevant.</p>
<p>This required me to rewrite the first 75 lines of each of the 9 Docbook files that currently make up the userguide, and change them from using sect1 tags, to using chapter tags. This actually makes it much more simpler for future contributors to add to the book, as they write their chapter and don’t have to worry about filling out all the revision history in each file, it’s updated in the foresight-user-guide.xml file instead of each individual one. I got in the zone and knocked all the files out last night, and submitted them to the Mercurial repo.</p>
<p>There is one bug I have yet to solve:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/561739489/" title="Photo Sharing"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>In two different sections of the Userguide, the “Help” section is called, both in the Preface chapter, and it references the IRC help sub-topic instead. A bug-hunting we will go.</p>
<p>I am sure that I haven’t done everything in the right order or by the book – for example, I’ve found references that GNOME developers use <code>make</code> to write documentation files, I can guess to why, but I’m not sure, nor can I figure out how they’re set up. I’m also not sure on the translation process, other than editing the files by hand but I’ve never created a program either that has had to use a <code>po</code> file.</p>
<p>I’m also darned if I can find where Yelp, when you start the GNOME Help from System &gt; Help, is calling the files on the right side under “Welcome to the GNOME Help Browser”. That’s where I want to put the userguide, but when you open /usr/share/yelp/toc.xml it only appears to be calling the links under “Desktop” on the left.</p>
<p>This has been a great experience so far, and isn’t even close to over. After I track down the bug and find a place for the userguide to live in the default documentation, it’s time to take Foresight documentation to the next level. The content written so far is not set in stone. In some cases, it only skims the top of what should be included in a given chapter, there are huge holes of information not even presented in the current guide, such as a better installation overview or printing, and more screenshots could be sprinkled throughout. Other sub-chapters could be written on specialized topics, such as installing on a Macbook or running OpenBox.</p>
<p>A process still needs to be developed to cull documentation on the wiki to live offline in the userguide. Documentation should be a living, breathing thing that grows with the operating system, not something that grows stale. (<em>Quick sidenote – the fact that GNOME still ships with the GNOME 2.14 Desktop Accessibility Guide and the GNOME 2.14 Desktop System Administration Guide in the default help page ticks me off to no end. Now that I have some limited experience with Docbook, it’s time to give back</em>). Taking user contribution submissions to the wiki and putting them in the userguide should be a high priority. Hopefully, the work done on the userguide so far can serve as a base for future contributors to continue to add content to, and people will find it useful as they use Foresight Linux.</p>

            <description>I decided to jump on the bandwagon and tried out my first appliances today, using the free VMWare player, and a couple of appliances from rpath.org.
Working on Foresight, a number of the images published are for various virtualization technolgies, such as VMWare, Parallels and Xen. Following the VMWare installation instructions in the Wiki, I installed VMWare on Foresight 1.3, downloaded 2 appliances, and was up and running in about 5 minutes.</description>

<p>Working on Foresight, a number of the images published are for various virtualization technolgies, such as VMWare, Parallels and Xen. Following the <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/docs/VMWare+Installation+HOWTO">VMWare installation instructions in the Wiki</a>, I installed VMWare on Foresight 1.3, downloaded 2 appliances, and was up and running in about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>I am starting to see why these are all the rage right now (at the last <a href="http://www.tclug.org">TCLUG</a> meeting, a lot of folks put Virtualization on the list for a future speaker to come talk about). From using an image for testing, to installing multiple appliances on a server for specific applications, there are some pretty cool use cases that become possible.</p>
<p>And yes, I know I’m late to the party on this topic, but better late than never. 🙂</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot of <a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/openfiler/">Openfiler</a>, a NAS appliance running in a VMWare player:</p>

            <description>Be there or be square.
A weekend in Chicago with other technologists, free beer and GNOME and Foresight on the agenda? (Not just any GNOME – the first ever US GNOME user group meeting at that).
Simply awesome.
We’ll see you June 23 &amp;amp; 24 in Chicago!</description>

            <description>Progress on the Userguide has been swift this week. Ken’s comments about having Foresight Linux 2.0 in testing in a “couple of weeks” spurred me to action. In no particular order are the things I’ve learned and accomplished this week:
 URLs. Again, it’s just a matter of re-wiring my brain from HTML to Docbook’s format. For example: [ulink url=&amp;quot;http://www.openoffice.org/product/math.html&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;http&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Math here[/ulink] (replace brackets with &amp;lt; or &amp;gt;) links to the Math page on OpenOffice.</description>

<ul>
<li>URLs. Again, it’s just a matter of re-wiring my brain from HTML to Docbook’s format. For example: <code>[ulink url=&quot;http://www.openoffice.org/product/math.html&quot; type=&quot;http&quot;&gt;Math here[/ulink]</code> (replace brackets with &lt; or &gt;) links to the Math page on OpenOffice.org. Similar, but different. And god knows I’m no HTML expert to start with.</li>
<li>Bullets have been driving me crazy. It was just one little thing, adding the mark=”bullet” to the tag, i.e.  <code>[itemizedlist mark=&quot;bullet&quot;]</code></li>
<li>3 of the 5 last pages created were created with <strong><em>zero</em></strong> syntax errors. Yes, pride cometh before the fall. All it means is I’m starting to get the hang of this. And I haven’t started doing any of the advanced formatting yet.</li>
<li>All pages have been committed. There’s some editing to be done (more on this below), but the directory structure is complete, all screenshots are uploaded,and the copy is complete in all XML files.</li>
<li>I’ve learned more Mercurial commands, such as hg pull and hg update, as I’ve worked on this on my laptop and desktop now. And I experienced a moment of panic after editing a file and not having done a pull. But I figured it out, thankfully.</li>
<li>I added a TODO file in the repository, but it probably needs to be updated more often.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things left to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first few pages need major formatting updates, especially on removing the indentation.</li>
<li>All pages need to be reviewed and edited for the correct URL tags.</li>
<li>Bullet points need to be fixed in almost all the pages.</li>
<li>Screenshots need to be resized to 510 pixels wide (so they print correctly, per the GNOME Documentation Handbook guidelines).</li>
<li>I still need to research, learn and build a Table of Contents.</li>
<li>I need to add some advanced formatting, specifically the arrow labels when showing how to access menus to run applications. (The <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag I believe).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>I still need to research on how to add this to the default Yelp page in GNOME, and how that will work from a packaging perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul Scott-Wilson asked a great question in IRC last night, regarding whether <a href="http://hg.foresightlinux.org/hg/foresight-user-guide/">Docbook repository</a> or the <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/docs/Getting+Started+with+Foresight+Linux">Wiki</a> will be the master copy of the userguide moving forward. My recommendation would be that Docbook would be the master copy, put together from the text on the wiki. This way it gives users a chance to contribute to the userguide on the wiki, adding new copy, having it proofed, and then moved to Docbook. The <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/docs/Printing">Printing</a> section is a great example of this, it’s 80% complete on the wiki, but it needs to be 100% to be included in Docbook. (Jonathan Brickman, where are you? Please finish the Printing page!) Additionally, the Docbook repository has source control, which would make it easier to manage over the long term. Opinions or thoughts? Leave a comment below on the blog, or email me at pcutler at foresightlinux dot org.</p>
<p>Progress will be small to non-existent as I have to travel for my day job. This probably means no blog updates either. More to come soon.</p>

            <description>I’m a big fan of Last.fm and since I started using Banshee, I’ve reported all my my music through it. A couple of tools came to my attention today.
Digg linked to the Mainstream-O-Meter to measure how mainstream your listening habits are. Digg, being the force they are, have made the site go offline temporarily. My music came in at 68% mainstream. 68%! I like to think I’m a little more eclectic, but maybe I’m not.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m a big fan of <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> and since I started using <a href="http://www.banshee-project.org">Banshee</a>, I’ve reported all my my music through it. A couple of tools came to my attention today.</p>
<p>Digg linked to the <a href="http://mainstream.vincentahrend.com/user/">Mainstream-O-Meter</a> to measure how mainstream your listening habits are. Digg, being the force they are, have made the site go offline temporarily. My music came in at 68% mainstream. 68%! I like to think I’m a little more eclectic, but maybe I’m not. Or maybe tech geeks like me who use Last.fm just have similar tastes. 🙂</p>
<p>Pscott linked the second one, <a href="http://lastgraph.aeracode.org/">LastGraph</a>, which graphs out your music listening habits over time. You can set the background color / theme, and the date range you want to graph.</p>
<p>Here’s my 2007 graph:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/535484535/" title="Photo Sharing"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>And here is since I started using Last.fm in Oct. 2005:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/535527225/" title="Photo Sharing"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Click through to Flickr to actually read them. A couple of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I hacked my Xbox, and added Last.fm reporting. My wife listening to music through it really skews it. (Dixie Chicks or U2 anyone?)</li>
<li>I’m definitely a streaky listener. I get stuck on an album or artist and listen to the crap out of it. (Liz Phair, Chili Peppers, The Shins)</li>
<li>You can tell when I installed my home theater in August of last year. From August to December, I wasn’t spending any time in my office on my PC. It was all about the new, big TV. The little music I listened to was on the Sonos through the network. (I so wish Sonos had Last.fm reporting built-in!)</li>
<li>I also listen to a lot of <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/the_current/">89.3 The Current</a>, both on the radio through the home theater, and streaming online through Banshee. That is not reflected in the graph. That is truly eclectic listening.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m a big enough fan, that I’ve actually subscribed for over the last year. I can’t say I’m thrilled by the recent acquisition by CBS, but I love the statistics Last.fm collects and lets me share, both on their website and through the badge on this blog.</p>

            <description>My original intent in this continuing series on Writing Documentation for Foresight was to post weekly, but I just had to share the latest news.
With Paul Scott-Wilson’s help in IRC last night, the Userguide’s first two chapters are now working in Yelp.

<p>With Paul Scott-Wilson’s help in IRC last night, the Userguide’s first two chapters are now working in Yelp. Pscott shared a diff file fixing some syntax issues, and pointed out I could just run yelp installation.xml to display the Docbook file in Yelp, or if it crashed, the terminal spit back all the errors and the lines to go fix them on. (I really do need to use the command line more.)</p>
<p>After spending a couple hours on all the errors that the terminal was yelling at me about, we now have Yelp displaying the Userguide (with images!):</p>

<p>There are still a number of typo’s I’m finding, especially as it relates to bullets and indentation, but the menu’s and links are working, the content is displayed, and best of all, no errors when starting from the command line. Check it out yourself from the <a href="http://hg.foresightlinux.org/hg/foresight-user-guide/">Mercurial repository</a>, it’s up to date.</p>
<p>Next up: Learn how to tie the docbook files together (Pscott pointed me at this link: <a href="http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/ModularDoc.html">http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/ModularDoc.html</a>) and package them up in Foresight. These first two chapters took me longer than expected to port to Docbook and re-write, so it’s probably a good idea to see if this even works.</p>

            <description>My son Alex has a blog.
And like his father, his alias (Nadrin) was randomly generated by a game.
My wife registered the domain and added it to my hosting account, and I installed WordPress for him this weekend, and he picked out the theme.
Good to know geekery runs in the family!
Here he is at his desk, his monitor is just out of sight on the left.</description>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=749">kicked off the first</a> blog post in my ongoing adventures to learn how to write GNOME documentation, posted as a long rant about my frustrations in the tools and information available. This week in part two, I’ll cover the start of porting the Userguide to Docbook, the tools I’m using, how I’m learning, and my unanswered questions.</p>
<p>After downloading the source for gedit, banshee and seahorse, I started browsing through the XML files to learn the structure and tags. I was using Gedit, but then on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=354">Og posted about Geany</a> and I decided to give that a try. (And of course it’s in the Foresight repos!) I mentioned it in IRC Thursday night as my new favorite tool for writing Docbook, and Ken recommended I use Mercurial for revision control.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/528361955/" title="Photo Sharing"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Ken set up a Mercurial <a href="http://hg.foresightlinux.org/hg/foresight-user-guide/">repo for the userguide</a> with the other <a href="http://hg.foresightlinux.org/hg">Foresight repos</a>, and answered my questions on using Mercurial as I quickly scanned the Mercurial documentation. Over the next couple of days I tweaked my Mercurial setup, fixing the author link with a tip from Ken, and getting Nano to be my default text editor as set in my .bashrc file.</p>
<p>One of the weird things I learned with Docbook, is that the section tags, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --> as you can see in the Gedit screenshot, having nothing to with creating sections in the documentation, rather they are the sublevels within a given chapter. I still don’t understand a number of the tags used by default, such as <code>guilabel</code>, which appears to be a bold tag. I fired off an <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-doc-list/2007-June/msg00001.html">email</a> to the GNOME-docs mailing list this morning, and Leonardo Fontenelle posted links to the Subversion repositories with the handbook and styleguide, which I’m slowly going through today.</p>
<p>For the <a href="http://hg.foresightlinux.org/hg/foresight-user-guide/">Userguide</a> itself, we are creating a folder for each <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/docs/Getting+Started+with+Foresight+Linux">chapter</a>, rather than creating one big XML file for Yelp in Mercurial. I’m hopeful a script can be written to tie the XML files together, but I haven’t even started looking at how you take these files and get them to display in Yelp. I’ve only finished chapter one, and chapter 2 is just over halfway done. There’s a lot of copy / paste going on, as I build the docbook structure for the chapter, then copy from the wiki to a text file, and copy chunks from that to the XML file. It’s slow going as I have to review the tags, and I’m just re-using the structure and tags I see used in other GNOME help files. But I learn best by doing, and repetition. At this point I have no idea if it’s working or not, or how many errors each file may have, which I won’t know until they’re displayed in Yelp. My goal is after I finish chapter 3 to ask for help in tackling that piece, in getting the files to display in Yelp, I’m assuming in a FL-1.</p>
<p>I’ve also mentioned this in IRC, but it’s really interesting for me on a personal level to be putting in to practice all the development practices I’ve read about over the years. From creating the source XML file to pushing the files in to a revision control system, it’s an interesting feeling building something from scratch. And this is just the beginning – once I have a few chapters I’ll need to learn how to package them for inclusion in Foresight, and then update the userguide with each release.</p>
<p>The only downside? With the Mercurial repository being public, you’ll be able to see if I’m working on the userguide or slacking off! No pressure there at all….</p>

The novels are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Man in the High Castle</li>
<li>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</li>
<li>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</li>
<li>Ubik</li>
</ul>
<p>The Library of America’s mission is to _“preserve the nation’s cultural heritage by publishing America’s best and most significant writing in authoritative editions is as strong as ever.”</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>Their goal is to publish books to <a href="http://www.libraryofamerica.com/page.jsp?id=204">last the test time</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The paper is acid-free and meets the requirements for permanence set by the American National Standards Institute; it will not turn yellow or brittle. The books are bound with the grain of the paper to ensure that they open easily and lie flat without crinkling or buckling.</li>
<li>The binding boards are flexible yet strong and make the book light, easy to carry, trim in appearance, and a pleasure to hold.</li>
<li>The page layout has been designed for clarity as well as elegance. The typeface, Galliard, is exceptionally readable and easy on the eyes.</li>
<li>The binding cloth is durable woven rayon, dyed in the thread for richness of color. Handsome endsheets match the binding cloth and add to the visual unity of the series. The books are Smyth-sewn for permanence and flexibility, and each includes a ribbon marker.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently the street date for the book is today. I actually picked this up almost 3 weeks ago in Milwaukee at a local book store. The book is gorgeous – it came shrink wrapped, and the paper quality and presentation is top notch. I own a lot of Dick’s short fiction, and look forward to reading some of his early novels.</p>

            <description>I’ve been hosted on Site5 for just shy of two years, and up until last week, the service has been great. Unfortunately, I’ve had 4 outages in the last week alone, and folks over at Webhostingtalkforums are saying similar things about Site5. I’ve only done a cursory glance at other webhosts, as I would have no idea where I would go. I see a lot of technical folks and blogs hosted at Mediatemple, but their reviews aren’t much better.</description>

Unfortunately, I’ve had 4 outages in the last week alone, and folks over at <a href="http://www.webhostingtalkforums.com">Webhostingtalkforums</a> are saying similar things about Site5. I’ve only done a cursory glance at other webhosts, as I would have no idea where I would go. I see a lot of technical folks and blogs hosted at <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net">Mediatemple</a>, but their reviews aren’t much better. After the two outages in the last 24 hours, I left a <a href="http://forums.site5.com/showthread.php?t=16852">heated post in the Site5 forums</a> this morning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m very disappointed with the recent downtime on Peony. I have a Multisite plan currently, and on Tues, May 22nd, Peony first appeared to go down. I let it go and it seemed to be up within an hour of me noticing it was down. The sites were unresponsive, and then they were back up, with the exception of MySQL, so a couple of my sites were displaying database couldn’t connect errors, such as my blog or forums on different domains.</p>
<p>The next day, May 23rd, it happened again, and I opened a trouble ticket. I was told due to several users monopolizing server resources my sites were down, and this was being addressed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sunday the 27th, my sites were down again, and I opened another trouble ticket. I was told that due to bots spamming SSH logins the server was down again and it was fixed. I wake up this morning, and my sites are still down, even though the trouble ticket said it was fixed.</p>
<p>I’ve been a happy Site5 customer just shy of 2 years – these are the kinds of things that have driven me to new webhosts over the years.</p>
<p>What disturbs and disappoints me the most is the lack of communication from the Site5 staff. If a server goes down 4 times in a week, I expect a level of personal communication showing the staff is on top of it and fixing it. In addition, in the Current Services Disruptions forum, not once is Peony listed as having a disruption. I would expect that bots flooding SSH logins would be listed as a disruption, as that is approaching a DDoS style attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the minimum, it made me feel better, and a few hours later a Sysadmin posted to mention they’ve added 2GB of RAM to the server and some kernel modifications and “are going to be monitoring the server very closely now to ensure it remains stable.”</p>
<p>Let’s hope so. And sorry about the downtime.</p>

            <description>Moosy, an OpenSUSE blog, has a short post up today on Elisa, mentioning that the 0.3 release will be a complete rewrite, and now includes Tango icons.
I look forward to the upcoming release. As I’ve mentioned before, Foresight has the latest Elisa release already in it’s repos, so hopefully we can get an updated version when it’s released. I was this close (holds fingers apart) to trying to reinstall MythTV this morning on my HTPC, but I couldn’t find a surge protector as I’m out of outlets at my home theater.</description>

            <description>Now that I have a few newsletters under my belt for Foresight Linux and completed the Getting Started user guide on the wiki, my next two big projects for Foresight are porting the Getting Started guide from the wiki to Docbook for inclusion in Yelp on a default Foresight installation, and getting some screencasts recorded and posted to the Foresight wiki.
With newsletter #3 out the door, and an hour or two on my hands, I decided to jump in and start learning some basics of Yelp, Docbook and contributing to GNOME documentation.</description>

<p>With newsletter #3 out the door, and an hour or two on my hands, I decided to jump in and start learning some basics of Yelp, Docbook and contributing to GNOME documentation. I started off keeping track of some interesting links I was coming across in Tomboy, and as my frustrations grew, it became a live journal of my research in to contributing to GNOME documentation. What follows is the unedited thoughts that ran through my brain for just over an hour as I looked for content on where to start on this journey.</p>
<p>The good thing I’ve learned in this process is what needs to be updated to make it easier for folks who want to help out GNOME and it’s documentation. Docs are one of the easiest areas for a new volunteer to get involved with, and now that I’ve complained publicly about my experiences, I’ve added it to my to-do list to try and make this better. (But it’s down on my to-do list after Foresight documentation in Yelp and screencasts. And maybe the new Foresight website, we’ll see).</p>
<p>Without further adieu, here are my notes:</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>GNOME Documentation**</p>
<p>Documenting my learnings on contributing to YELP</p>
<p>15:45 – Start looking on the GNOME wiki and Google</p>
<p><a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject">http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject</a></p>
<p>(last update in October 2006)</p>
<p><a href="http://live.gnome.org/ProjectMallard">http://live.gnome.org/ProjectMallard</a> (next generation GNOME docs tool in development)</p>
<p>15:55 join IRC (#docs on GIMPnet)</p>
<p>Continue to use the Wiki and Google:</p>
<p><a href="http://live.gnome.org/DeveloperGuides">http://live.gnome.org/DeveloperGuides</a> (could be a gold mine, lots of links)</p>
<p><a href="http://live.gnome.org/IdealDeveloperDocumentation">http://live.gnome.org/IdealDeveloperDocumentation</a> (A wishlist of perfect documentation, last updated last August)</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gdp/handbook/gdp-handbook/index.html">http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gdp/handbook/gdp-handbook/index.html</a> (last update 2003, this had to be the bible for doc developers once upon a time)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/oswg/oswg-nightly/oswg/en_US.ISO_8859-1/articles/DocBook-Intro/docbook-intro/">http://www.ibiblio.org/oswg/oswg-nightly/oswg/en_US.ISO_8859-1/articles/DocBook-Intro/docbook-intro/</a> (Linked from the GDP handbook above, it’s from 1999!)</p>
<p>16:05: Edit the GNOME wiki with a broken link to the non-existent style guide:</p>
<p><a href="http://live.gnome.org/DeveloperGuides">http://live.gnome.org/DeveloperGuides</a></p>
<p>16:10 Ask for help in IRC (no response, but I’m patient)</p>
<p>16:15 Find new links that look helpful:</p>
<p><a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Contributing">http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Contributing</a></p>
<p><a href="http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Contributing/SubmittingPatches">http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Contributing/SubmittingPatches</a></p>
<p>16:18 Complain in #foresight about the irony in that getting started with the GNOME documentation team isn’t really documented</p>
<p>16:24 Realize the link above on SubmittingPatches is also horribly outdated as GNOME has moved to subversion</p>
<p>Make mental note that I should be probably updating the GNOME documentation personally with these learnings. Add to to-do list in Tomboy</p>
<p>16:29 Thilo agrees with me in IRC, and reinforces an opinion I have too:</p>
<p>thilopfennig: pcutler_: yeah</p>
<p>thilopfennig: thats true</p>
<p>even simple links are broken</p>
<p>and nobody cares really</p>
<p>That last sentence bothers me, as I had the same thought. Perception is reality.</p>
<p>16:31 Pull up the GNOME SVN wiki page and prepare to checkout some help files to browse through as a base:</p>
<p><a href="http://live.gnome.org/SubversionFAQ">http://live.gnome.org/SubversionFAQ</a></p>
<p>16:36 first 2 projects svn co doesn’t work, try with epiphany, but it pulls the whole source, and not the help files. keep reading through LGO. Quite frustrated.</p>
<p>16:43 Pull down Gedit files. Realize that I was pulling the help files correctly with SVN, but still can’t find english versions. Mistakenly ask for help in IRC, when I did do it right.</p>
<p>16:46 Remind self it’s a holiday weekend in US on a Sunday afternoon, of course no one is going to respond.</p>
<p>16:48 Open Gedit, and start browsing through source files. In the Help directory, the “C” subdirectory has “gedit.xml” – I found the file! Why is it in the C directory if it’s American English? Who thinks of these things? All the other files I pulled down were correct as well.</p>
<p>16:55 Finish scrolling through gedit.xml after opening the files in Yelp for comparison. Docbook looks fairly sane, if just overly, well, there’s a lot to it, but it’s fairly logical. Overwhelmed by the sheer amount of work porting the userguide from the wiki to Docbook will be, but it’s doable.</p>
<p>16:56 Walk away. Remind self to blog this.</p>

            <description>About 6 months ago, I burned my blog’s RSS feed to Feedburner. I was using WP-Shortstat as a WordPress plugin, and the RSS feed subscribers didn’t look realistic (and they weren’t!) as it was over reporting on the number of subscribers. I’ve been happy with Feedburner since, and it provided a very simple view to my feed’s statistics, and there was a plugin to view the statistics right in my WordPress dashboard.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About 6 months ago, I burned my blog’s RSS feed to Feedburner. I was using WP-Shortstat as a WordPress plugin, and the RSS feed subscribers didn’t look realistic (and they weren’t!) as it was over reporting on the number of subscribers. I’ve been happy with Feedburner since, and it provided a very simple view to my feed’s statistics, and there was a <a href="http://orderedlist.com/articles/feedburner-feedsmith">plugin to view the statistics</a> right in my WordPress dashboard.</p>
<p>When I was syndicated on Planet Foresight, I created a Linux feed on Feedburner so those users weren’t subject to my entertainment and copyright rants, and later I burned a feed of the Foresight Linux Newsletter as well.</p>
<p>Since then, I continue to learn more about Feedburner and its features, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2007/05/feedburner_adopts_twoyearold_r_1.php">Feedburner takes over</a> Steve Smith’s WordPress plugin for Feedburner stats, renames it Feedsmith.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2007/04/ricks_ruminations_full_feeds.php">Rick @ Feedburner recaps why partial feeds are a bad thing</a>. I couldn’t agree more – I’m too lazy to follow links out of my feedreader just because a site wants hits. I’ll usually end up unsubscribing after a while unless the site has really, really good content, like TV Squad.</li>
<li>It might be fun to create a <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/publishers/headlineanimator">Headline Animator</a> – if I could do a non-cheesy looking one, might be a good way to market the Foresight newsletter</li>
<li>I can’t believe I didn’t know about <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/publishers/feedflare">FeedFlares</a> until today – what a great concept. Add little tags to the end of your posts, such as “add to del.icio.us”, “email author” etc. See the <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/help/flarecatalog">whole list here</a>. I’ve already updated my feed. And the have an open <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/developers/feedflare">FeedFlare API</a> to create your own.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also use Feedburner as tool combined with the <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/dashboard.action">Foresight Wiki</a> based on Confluence. Confluence gives you the ability to build a feed right from the dashboard, but it’s really only useful for tracking a whole space, and not independent pages.</p>
<p>The first feed I built was the Foresight Linux Newsletter. Using Confluence, I created a RSS 2 feed based on any news post in the Newsletter space. Confluence gave me me a feed that looks like this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;br /&gt; http://issues.foresightlinux.org/confluence/createrssfeed.action?types=blogpost&amp;statuses=created&lt;br /&gt; &amp;spaces=newsletter&amp;labelString=&amp;rssType=rss2&amp;maxResults=10&amp;timeSpan=180&lt;br /&gt; &amp;publicFeed=true&amp;title=Foresight+Linux+Newsletter+RSS+Feed</code></p>
<p>Not necessarily human readable, or easy for a subscribe to type in to their feedreader, though possible using cut and paste.</p>
<p>I took that feed, and burned it in Feedburner, and got this:</p>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/foresightnewsletter">http://feeds.feedburner.com/foresightnewsletter</a></p>
<p>Much better, and now I have statistics tracking for our subscribers (Which we need more of!)</p>
<p>The second feed I created in Confluence, was for the <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/kitchen/Requests">Package Request</a> page on the Wiki. On this page, users can request software packages to be added to the Foresight repository, so they can install them via Conary, instead of building and compiling the software by hand.</p>
<p>Confluence doesn’t give you an option, at least that I could find, to build a feed for a specific page. First, I gave the the wiki page a specific label, “package-requests”. I then went to the Feed Builder, and chose to build a feed in the Developer space, with a label “package-requests” and to show all new edits and comments on the page. Confluence gave me the feed:</p>
<p><code>http://issues.foresightlinux.org/confluence/createrssfeed.action?types=page&amp;types=comment&lt;br /&gt; &amp;statuses=created&amp;statuses=modified&amp;spaces=kitchen&amp;labelString=package-requests&lt;br /&gt; &amp;rssType=rss2&amp;maxResults=10&amp;timeSpan=5&amp;publicFeed=true&amp;title=Foresight+Linux+Package+Requests+RSS+Feed&lt;br /&gt;</code></p>
<p>I burned that in Feedburner and came up with:</p>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/fl-packagerequests">http://feeds.feedburner.com/fl-packagerequests</a></p>
<p>So if you want to add that to your feedreader, you will see all requests and comments for new packages, as well as edits to the page when someone marks a package as added to the repository.</p>
<p>I’m really starting to dig the power of Feedburner.</p>

            <description>Big Media is nothing if not two-faced about the creation of derivative works. From the music industry busting re-mix artists – the same artists paid by the industry to promote their artists in dance clubs, to the film industry’s penchant for remakes. And how many movies made today are born from an original idea? Even this year’s Best Picture winner, The Departed, is a remake of a Hong Kong film.</description>

            <description>Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Canonical and Ubuntu Linux, has a stirring blog post up titled In defense of independent governance.
I cannot due a summary justice, but Mr. Shuttleworth’s extremely well written words on culture, democracy and free speech have moved me, and I encourage you to read it.
I’ll leave you with this from Mark Shuttleworth:
 At times like these, we are our own worst enemy. We hear what we want to hear.</description>

<p>I cannot due a summary justice, but Mr. Shuttleworth’s extremely well written words on culture, democracy and free speech have moved me, and I encourage you to read it.</p>
<p>I’ll leave you with this from Mark Shuttleworth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At times like these, we are our own worst enemy. We hear what we want to hear. It is painful to hear that one might be wrong, that ones hero might have flaws, that ones leaders might not be all that we wished them to be. The awful truth of the media is that it pays to tell people what they want to hear, much more than it pays to tell people what they need to hear, and so society can whip itself into a frenzy of mistaken greed or fear or anger, and make poor decisions.</p>
<p>It takes great courage to speak out, when these basic principles are at risk. In a free society, there is nevertheless pressure to conform, to stay with the herd. In a society that is not free, one speaks out at some considerable personal cost to life and liberty. I salute those who do.</p>

            <description>With the recent announcement of Ubuntu forming a Media Center team focusing on Elisa as it’s media center platform, I took another look at Elisa as a potential solution for my home theater PC.

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the recent announcement of Ubuntu forming a <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuMediaCenterTeam">Media Center team</a> focusing on <a href="http://elisa.fluendo.com/">Elisa</a> as it’s media center platform, I took another look at Elisa as a potential solution for my home theater PC. (Sidenote: I’m way too lazy and need a gook kick in the butt. I’ve had my HTPC built and ready to go for a year, and have barely tried to fix the last few issues I have with it. Shame on me. Though since I got my dual-tuner HD-DVR from DirecTV, when combined with my Sonos and Xbox 360, I haven’t really needed all the features of a HTPC that I originally planned on).</p>
<p>Elisa was already available in the Foresight repository, but it was version 0.0.1. Asking nicely in IRC, Ken Vandine updated the version to Elisa’s current release, 0.1.6. Ken was unable to run it because of an ATI or Xorg issue in 1-devel with 3D effects, but it started right up for me.</p>
<p>I’ll do a more formal review later, I’ve only played with it for maybe 30-60 minutes tops over the last day and a half, but for a very, very early release, Elisa looks promising. After some user error on where you edit different file locations in the ~/elisa/elisa.conf file, I was able to browse my music and photos.</p>
<p>To be clear, it’s a program to manage your media – it does not have DVR functionality built-in. And for me, that may just be perfect. It will manage your movies &amp; videos, play DVDs, photos, and music. It has built-in support already for Streamzap remotes. (I don’t know what that is yet, but I’m going to find out).</p>
<p>One obvious bug, is when I start Elisa from a terminal or Alt-F2, there is no window border. Changing Elisa to fullscreen with the “F” key and back to a windowed version, brings up a window. This tip is useful, because if you don’t, and you lose focus of Elisa, none of the shortcut keys work if the window border isn’t there.</p>
<p>I’m going to play with it more this weekend, and will post more thoughts on Elisa early next week. For now, here are some screenshots of Elisa in action, with bigger versions available on my Flickr account.</p>

            <description>I bought a copy of Crackdown when it came out a few months ago, and was quite happy with the game. It was fun to play a GTA-style game on the side of the good guys for once.
An added benefit of buying Crackdown was an exclusive invite to the Halo 3 beta, which went live this past Wed. Or was supposed to. Of course demand was higher than expected, and the download was delayed a few times throughout the day.</description>

<p>An added benefit of buying Crackdown was an exclusive invite to the Halo 3 beta, which went live this past Wed. Or was supposed to. Of course demand was higher than expected, and the download was delayed a few times throughout the day.</p>
<p>I was finally able to download, and I start the beta through Crackdown – which takes about 10 minutes from start to finally getting in the game after going through the Halo 3 lobby and matchmaking. And each time I try to play, I get an error: “The disc is unreadable” – which is kind of funny as there is no disc.</p>
<p>There are a <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Forums/posts.aspx?postID=10787368">few</a> <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Forums/posts.aspx?postID=10918577&amp;v%20iewreplies=true#end">threads</a> on the Bungie / Halo 3 forums about this, with other folks having the same issue, and no clear cut fix. Quite frustrating, to say the least.</p>

            <description>One of my new favorite blogs to read, Total Dick-head, devoted to everything Philip K. Dick, has the details on the next Bladerunner DVD release, via DavisDVD.
I love Bladerunner – it was really the Director’s Cut being released in theaters that really got me into it, as I remember going to the Oriental in Milwaukee to watch it, and just being blown away. The first DVD release was pretty poor – it was basically just the Laserdisc version slapped on to DVD without being remastered, and the quality is iffy at best.</description>

<p>I love Bladerunner – it was really the Director’s Cut being released in theaters that really got me into it, as I remember going to the Oriental in Milwaukee to watch it, and just being blown away. The first DVD release was pretty poor – it was basically just the Laserdisc version slapped on to DVD without being remastered, and the quality is iffy at best. Bladerunner is by far the best adapation of a Philip K. Dick story (though A Scanner Darkly is the truest adaption), and the story, the visuals, and the acting were all top notch.</p>
<p>I eagerly await this release on DVD! Read the <a href="http://totaldickhead.blogspot.com/2007/05/blade-runner-ultimate-collection.html">details on the 5 disc box set here.</a></p>

            <description>A follow-up to last night’s post about Bluetooth adapters on Linux to use a headset with my desktop:
_
Breaking News: Foresight Developers can read minds!_
Serendipity struck, that within an hour of posting, Ken Vandine pinged me in IRC on #foresight to let me know that earlier in the day, he had already updated the Bluetooth ALSA packages on Foresight to make this project work.
So not only will Foresight developers package up software if you ask nicely in IRC, I have now learned that Foresight Developers have the ability to read minds, and package software they know their users will want later in the day.</description>

            <description>Dear Lazyweb: I’m looking for a USB Bluetooth adapter that is Linux friendly.
I have two headsets with boom mics I’ve used on my desktop – one is a cheap off-brand, and one is a very nice Plantronics. I have been working on a podcast off and on for the last couple of months using Jokosher, more as a test to learn Jokosher so I can add audio to screencasts and help show users how to use Foresight.</description>

<p>I have two headsets with boom mics I’ve used on my desktop – one is a cheap off-brand, and one is a very nice Plantronics. I have been working on a podcast off and on for the last couple of months using <a href="http://www.jokosher.org/">Jokosher</a>, more as a test to learn Jokosher so I can add audio to screencasts and help show users how to use Foresight.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the sound quality on the boom mics is lacking – the cheap off brand sounds tinny, and the Plantronics makes it sound like the mic is 10 feet away from my voice, and doesn’t really move on the headset so I can position it better.</p>
<p>However, I just received a <a href="http://www.jawbone.com">Jawbone</a> bluetooth headset for my cellphone. The Jawbone’s claim to fame is that they made it for DARPA, and it blocks all ambient noise so you only hear the user’s voice. My hope is that it might work well for voice recording on Linux. But I’m not sure how compatible the different USB Bluetooth adapters are for pairing a device like a headset, and I don’t even know if Jokosher or other applications will see the headset as a microphone for voice recording.</p>
<p>If anyone has any thoughts, please leave a comment here, or drop me a line at pcutler _at_ foresightlinux dot org.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <description>Do you need a Joost beta invite? I’ve hooked up all the friends (I think) who want one, and still have a bunch leftover.
Drop me an email at pcutler _at_ foresightlinux.org if you want one.
Mac &amp;amp; Windows only now, thought there have been rumors of a Linux client sometime in the future.
It’s definitely interesting – and different. Joost continues to sign up content partners, and it’s getting better each week.</description>

<p>It’s definitely interesting – and different. Joost continues to sign up content partners, and it’s getting better each week. I don’t use it all that often as I’ve been mostly using my laptop now rather than my desktop, but when I am in my den, I’ll run it on my extra Windows box from time to time just as background noise and to keep tabs on what the Joost folks are up to.</p>

            <description>I’ve been off the grid most of the weekend, as I took the family home to Wisconsin to visit the in-laws.
My father-in-law has a wireless broadband connection (supposed to be about 1 meg down, but feels much slower). It’s connect to a Linksys 802.11b router. I’ve been unable to to get my Toshiba laptop to connect to the net, though my work laptop running XP didn’t have a problem nor did my wife.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been off the grid most of the weekend, as I took the family home to Wisconsin to visit the in-laws.</p>
<p>My father-in-law has a wireless broadband connection (supposed to be about 1 meg down, but feels much slower). It’s connect to a Linksys 802.11b router. I’ve been unable to to get my Toshiba laptop to connect to the net, though my work laptop running XP didn’t have a problem nor did my wife. My Toshiba gets an IP address and saw the nameservers on the wireless (eth1), but has horrendous packet loss. Pinging google.com resulted in 66% packet loss, and web pages wouldn’t pull up at all. I don’t know if it was a Linux thing, Foresight, or the ISP itself.</p>
<p>It has reminded me how much I loathe not being connected. So much for tackling learning docbook this weekend for the Foresight user guide or the blog theme on WordPress MU.</p>
<p>Having some time on my hands, I did do some shopping yesterday, stopping at a <a href="http://www.schwartzbooks.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=0">local bookstore</a>, who hosted <a href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/">John Scalzi</a> just over a week ago. I missed him in Minneapolis last week, and was able to pick up an autographed copy of his latest book, The Last Colony, which oddly isn’t featured on his <a href="http://www.scalzi.com/books/">Books page</a> yet. The Last Colony is the third book in his Old Man’s War trilogy.</p>
<p>On a recommendation, I picked up <a href="http://www.chrismoore.com/you_suck.html">You Suck</a> by Christopher Moore, which was good and as funny as promised. I finished it yesterday, and I love books that make me laugh out loud, which this did a few times. An odd note about the book: One of the characters is from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, about an hour north of where I am visiting right now in Milwaukee. I was born in Fond du Lac, and most of my extended relatives live there. It’s fairly small with about 40,000 residents, and I was surprised to see it in a book. (But not as surprised when Oconomowoc, where I am right now, was featured in Cryptonomicon).</p>
<p>I also picked up a nice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Philip-K-Dick-Stigmata-Eldritch/dp/1598530097">hardcover edition</a> of four Philip K. Dick stories – The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Ubik and The Man in the High Castle. I own a number of his short stories, and since it was featured on Boing Boing, the <a href="http://totaldickhead.blogspot.com/">Total Dick-Head blog</a> has been a favorite of mine to read, so it was good to pick up a couple of Dick’s classics.</p>
<p>I enjoy supporting local bookstores, it’s always worth the premium I pay in my mind. I enjoyed visiting Harry Schwartz Bookstores. They had a fairly good collection of books in all genres, and had recommendations for books by their employees all over the store, which I loved.</p>
<p>Now it’s off to lunch and a 6 – 7 hour drive home today.</p>

            <description>In what surely will be the most talked about story of the week (just above Dell shipping Ubuntu on PCs), Digg melted down last night. I watched it in real time last night as more and more users added stories displaying the banned HD-DVD encryption key.
It’s amazing how one 16 digital hexadecimal string of numbers (and a little bit of censorship) can wake up a community.
The blog at Franticindustries has the best recap of the story I’ve seen yet.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In what surely will be the most talked about story of the week (just above Dell shipping Ubuntu on PCs), Digg melted down last night. I watched it in real time last night as more and more users added stories displaying the banned HD-DVD encryption key.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how one 16 digital hexadecimal string of numbers (and a little bit of censorship) can wake up a community.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://franticindustries.com/blog/2007/05/02/how-one-hexadecimal-string-changed-the-internet/">blog at Franticindustries has the best recap</a> of the story I’ve seen yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But never until today has the entire Internet risen as one to protect their right of free speech, with one string of hexadecimal numbers being their defeaning shout.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the article goes on to say, Digg was only the catalyst – almost every other major tech site of note has the key displayed in a story or a user submitted comment. The early adopters and tech enthusiasts are rising up against DRM – it’s now becoming more than a movement. In the year when major record labels are going DRM free in music, users patience with digital rights management for next gen technologies is wearing thin. Users want to use their content how they want to – they don’t want to be told when and how they can use their content. If I want to listen to music I legally purchased online on the device of my choice, I should have that ability. If I want to buy a movie on DVD, and encode it to watch on a portable player, I should be able to do that. If I want to watch a DVD movie on my computer, that doesn’t run Windows, I should be able to do that.</p>
<p>This is how we got DVD playback on Linux – one software company left a hole open displaying the encryption key, and it happened again with HD-DVD. When both parts of the key are available to the user – one half on the hardware or in software playback, and the other half in the media itself, users are going to figure it out. Just like the Digg users rising up as one, the community dedicated to breaking the encryption is united as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For some reason, this key has become more than just a way to circumvent copy protection: it is now a statement.</p>
<p>It says: information must be free.</p>
<p>In as little as 24 hours, countless iterations of the key have sprung out. Theres a registered domain containing the key; theres a string of colors equivalent to the key value; hell, if license plates were allowed to have 32 digits I bet there would be a great demand for a particular number.</p>

            <description>Linux seems to always get a knock when it comes to gaming. I know personally I believed the FUD, before making the switch to Linux full time 2 years ago and learning otherwise. What Linux doesn’t have in quantity as a gaming platform, it does make up in quality.
A lot of the open source and freeware get the publicity, but id software and Epic, among other developers, makers of Quake and Unreal Tournament respectively, continue to put out native Linux binaries of their software.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Linux seems to always get a knock when it comes to gaming. I know personally I believed the FUD, before making the switch to Linux full time 2 years ago and learning otherwise. What Linux doesn’t have in quantity as a gaming platform, it does make up in quality.</p>
<p>A lot of the open source and freeware <a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/04/09/Linux_has_game/1.html">get the publicity</a>, but <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/">id software</a> and <a href="http://www.epicgames.com/">Epic</a>, among other developers, makers of Quake and Unreal Tournament respectively, continue to put out native Linux binaries of their software.</p>
<p>With the upcoming <a href="http://www.enemyterritory.com/">Enemy Territory: Quake Wars</a> release, I installed Quake IV, Doom 3 and the original Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory on my desktop today. Since I did a clean install of Foresight a couple months ago, I wanted to make sure I work out any kinks before ET:QW’s release.</p>
<p>Everything worked like a champ – I downloaded the Linux installation files from <a href="http://zerowing.idsoftware.com:6969/">id software’s bittorrent server</a>, installed those in /home/silwenae/games (I’m lazy, didn’t feel like chmod’ing /usr/games), copied the pak files over, and ran Doom 3 and Quake IV. Mapped my keys, cranked the video settings, and I was online in minutes fragging away.</p>
<p>The only small glitch I ran into with Quake IV, and this hasn’t happened in my two or three previous installs, was that it started in Spanish. A quick Google search <a href="http://www.linuxgames.com/forums/index.php?t=msg&amp;goto=715&amp;rid=0&amp;S=ad78e96a24b77c7ea080dcb2f2e47d1a">turned up the fix</a>: Go into your home folder, and in the .quake4 directory (which is hidden, hit ctrl-h in Nautilus to view hidden files and directories), and then the q4base directory, and edit the Quake4Config.cfg file with your favorite text editor, and change the value of sys-lang to english, and you’re all set.</p>
<p>Everything worked great out of the box, I didn’t have the funky <a href="http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/linux/doom/#head-8c36163f1dfc3a253ef72c0f821b0b0dd2fc17b1">Alsa / OSS sound issue</a> I had in the past with Ubuntu, even that worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>Who said you couldn’t game on Linux? Come get some!</p>

            <description>Stuff I’m currently working on:
 Getting Started with Foresight Linux: A user’s guide to start using Foresight Linux. Currently it’s about 50% complete, but I expect to have it 90% complete by the end of the weekend. Includes installing Foresight, configuring, overview of the most used applications, updating Foresight, getting help and contributing. Feel free to contribute. Long term, I want to convert it to html and / or docbook as well.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stuff I’m currently working on:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/docs/Getting+Started+with+Foresight+Linux">Getting Started with Foresight Linux</a>: A user’s guide to start using Foresight Linux. Currently it’s about 50% complete, but I expect to have it 90% complete by the end of the weekend. Includes installing Foresight, configuring, overview of the most used applications, updating Foresight, getting help and contributing. Feel free to contribute. Long term, I want to convert it to html and / or docbook as well.</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/marketing/Foresight+Linux+Newsletter">Foresight Newsletter</a>. The first newsletter was well received, but was done in less than week of it’s release. It should have content being added consistently through out the month, which I need to start doing, and find a way to get more volunteers to add content such as highlighting a package or doing an interview.</li>
<li>Gaming – Since I did a clean install of Foresight, I need to reinstall my games (Second Life, Quake IV, Doom 3, UT2k4). Lots of Quake 3 total conversions <a href="http://www.linuxgames.com/news/feedback.php?identiferID=9041&amp;action=flatview">have been in the news</a> the last week or two, wouldn’t mind trying those out as well. I probably should add some content to the wiki about gaming on Foresight.</li>
<li>Foresight Calendar – There’s a rumor that a Google Calendar exists for Foresight. I’m thinking I may poke at it, it may be an interesting exercise to add key dates to it, such as GNOME releases, Foresight releases, etc. It may make adding content to the newsletter more structured and give users an idea of key dates.</li>
<li><a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/">WordPress-MU</a> theme: There is some interest in adding blogs to foresightlinux.org. There’s still a question around where to publish the newsletter, though the wiki seems to be working for that, but also to offer developers blogs who may not have their own webspace. First, we’re going to need a theme, so I may hack at that – my html-foo is poor, so I’ve been putting that off, and then we need to get it on the webserver. I’m more than happy to admin it for folks who want blogs. I’ll probably throw WordPress-MU up on my webspace this weekend and poke at it to see what the admin interface is like.</li>
<li>Screencasts: Based on a discussion in IRC on Saturday, I thought I’d give creating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast">screencasts</a> a shot. I played with Istanbul a little over the weekend, and it will work, though the audio quality was pretty poor, and I have a very nice Plantronics headset. A big thanks to pscott for re-packaging <a href="http://www.jokosher.org/">Jokosher</a> and packaging <a href="http://www.pitivi.org/wiki/Main_Page">Pitivi</a>. My current plan is take the Getting Started guide pages on Applications, and create screencasts that match the write-ups I did for the apps. (See the <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/docs/Banshee+Music+Manager">Banshee page</a> for a good example). I’ll record the screencast in Istanbul, then the audio in Jokosher, and use Pitivi to edit them together. It’s a little more long term, as the screencasts will need to be well scripted, both the video capture and the audio narration.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it for now – I don’t want to put too much on my plate and get burned out, so I’m trying to take it in chunks and stay focused. The newsletter and Getting Started guide are definitely the short term focus.</p>

            <title>GNOME 3.0?</title>

            <description>The concept of GNOME 3.0 (aka Project Topaz) has been thrown around over the last year or two, with no clear definition or direction of the next big step in the development of GNOME.
Last year, Luis Villa blogged a few ideas that could become the future of GNOME, around an internet enabled OS, tied to an infrastructure similar to Apple’s .mac. I’ve had similar thoughts floating through my brain since then, but yesterday Havoc Pennington of Red Hat &amp;amp; Mugshot verbalized almost exactly what I’ve been thinking about in a way I’ve never been to articulate.</description>

<p>Last year, <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/">Luis Villa</a> blogged a few ideas that could become the future of GNOME, around an internet enabled OS, tied to an infrastructure similar to Apple’s .mac. I’ve had similar thoughts floating through my brain since then, but yesterday Havoc Pennington of Red Hat &amp; Mugshot <a href="http://log.ometer.com/2007-04.html#3">verbalized almost exactly</a> what I’ve been thinking about in a way I’ve never been to articulate.</p>
<p>Havoc references <a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/03/26/1323213">Dave Neary’s recent interview</a> that GNOME as a platform is becoming different things to different people, with Nokia’s implementation of Maemo on the 770 a prime example. I think Dave’s exactly right, and this strategy and direction for GNOME is a good thing.</p>
<p>What’s interesting to me is the future of the home user, and Havoc’s musings touches on that. GNOME could be an embedded platform or an enterprise solution, but to me it seems as most innovation is being done around the home computing user. Web services such as Flickr, del.icio.us, Gmail, last.fm and other social networking sites started, and still are, geared first and foremost towards the home user. Havoc’s thoughts on the target user are right on. Starting with the early adopter, the technoloy enthusiasts and influencers, and tying those people, and their stuff together, is the future.</p>
<p>The rumor has always been that this is what Google is doing – through Gmail archiving your email, Calendar, Google Docs – they will host your content and tie it paid search to make money. Gtalk’s contacts is a poor start, but Google Doc’s collaboration tools are a good example of tying your content to your communities.</p>
<p>Internet enabled is a key, but I don’t think Google has to win in this space. Giving you access to your community and your content can be done through the operating system, though Luis Villa’s thoughts from last year on a GNOME-centric .Mac type service are where this could get really interesting.</p>
<p>I don’t think there is a question that we are reaching a tipping point in the way operating systems are built and used – even Microsoft has alluded to Vista being the last of their operating systems being built and released in the current manner. Apple is the master of the incremental operating system, and while innovative, is still too closed source to win in this space. It will take a community to build the future, as it is about the people and how and where they use their stuff, and it is this community – the open source community, that has the best chance to innovate and create this future. And I can’t wait for the future.</p>

            <description>Distrowatch Weekly is out, and the April 2nd edition has some kind words for the first Foresight Newsletter:
 It is always a pleasure to report that a project has gone out of its way to complement its distribution with additional material.

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20070402">Distrowatch Weekly is out</a>, and the April 2nd edition has some kind words for the first <a href="http://issues.foresightlinux.org/confluence/display/newsletter/2007/03/30/Foresight+Linux+Newsletter+Volume+1%2C+Issue+1+%28March+2007%29;jsessionid=96BC04050056F4156F9F8C7DA6B60AE0">Foresight Newsletter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is always a pleasure to report that a project has gone out of its way to complement its distribution with additional material. Last week, Foresight Linux, an rPath-based desktop distribution with focus on the latest GNOME technologies, announced the launch of its new monthly newsletter: “The first Foresight Linux Newsletter has been released! The current edition reports about what’s happening with Foresight Linux, including information on the latest release, security updates, tips and tricks, what’s in development, and Foresight in the press.” Glancing through the first issue, this has to be one of the best distribution-specific newsletters available anywhere. Complete with a “Letter from the Editor”, a tip for ATI graphics card users, introduction to the Banshee music manager, the newsletter is well worth a read even if you are not a Foresight Linux user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the kind words, and now the bar has been set for future issues.</p>
<p>In other news, I’ve also updated the RSS feed for the Foresight Newsletter, you can subscribe using a feed I created in Feedburner. Just pop this in to your favorite RSS reader to subscribe: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/foresightnewsletter">http://feeds.feedburner.com/foresightnewsletter</a> (Just a bit easier than the other RSS feed, and a bit shorter).</p>

            <description>Tristan Rhodes blogs (seen via Planet Ubuntu), about Distrowatch‘s Top 5 Distro’s from 2002 until today. It is, as Tristan mentions, unscientific as Distrowatch ranks it by click through’s to that distro’s information page on Distrowatch. It’s interesting to see the changes through just 5 short years.
I eagerly look forward to the day Foresight is on the list.</description>

            <description>Michael Larabel, of Phoronix fame, has a blog post noting that Gamestop has started pre-orders for Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, and Best Buy will begin pre-orders on April 12th, with the game being released on June 5th, the first time I’ve seen a release date assigned.
As I’ve noted previously, this is the first time in a long time I’ve been this excited over a game release. Since I gave up Windows 2 years ago after being a hardcore gamer for many years, I’ve cut way back on my gaming, and have pretty much turned into a console gamer.</description>

<p>As I’ve noted previously, this is the first time in a long time I’ve been this excited over a game release. Since I gave up Windows 2 years ago after being a hardcore gamer for many years, I’ve cut way back on my gaming, and have pretty much turned into a console gamer. I still play Battlefield 2 about twice a month at a buddy’s house who has an extra PC set up for me, which is quite fun when playing with friends in a squad. I’m hoping ET:QW takes the squad based, objective elements to a new level for a first person shooter. That, and it’s the Doom3 engine, so it will be gorgeous. Once UT2k7 comes out later this year, I should have plenty to keep me busy gaming on the Linux platform.</p>
<p>I did have UT2k4, Doom3 and Quake IV installed on my Linux PC, which reminds me I need to get it installed on my new Foresight installation, and throw up a wiki page for installing 3D games on Foresight.</p>

            <description>I posted to the lists last night to discuss creating a Foresight Newsletter.
The short story is, what would you want to see in a newsletter, and how often would you like to see it published? Send an email to the list with your thoughts, or help edit the Newsletter wiki page.
As far as publishing frequency, the newsletter will only be as good as the content included! I’ve volunteered to pull it together, and will have a rough draft up tonight for the first issue.</description>

<p>The short story is, what would you want to see in a newsletter, and how often would you like to see it published? Send an email to the list with your thoughts, or help edit the <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/marketing/Foresight+Linux+Newsletter+Overview">Newsletter wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>As far as publishing frequency, the newsletter will only be as good as the content included! I’ve volunteered to pull it together, and will have a rough draft up tonight for the first issue. Don’t be surprised if I come knocking looking for more content for future issues too, so collaboration will be key!</p>
<p>I’m also looking for a volunteer to quickly put together a WordPress / WordPress-MU theme. We’re thinking of publishing the newsletter on a blog to make it easy to update and subscribe to via RSS, though that part may not be ready by the weekend.</p>
<p>I believe a newsletter is a great tool for marketing and promotion, and keeping users informed of what’s going on with Foresight, especially for those who may not subscribe to the lists, visit the wiki or IRC, and show active Foresight is.</p>

            <description>I mentioned in my last post, that I purchased a Toshiba A135-S4467 laptop yesterday. The following is a very long post, including the laptop’s specs, installing Foresight, and some of the challenges I have figured out or am trying to overcome in getting Foresight Linux.
If you don’t want to read a very long post, you can stop now. The short version of this story, is that after a user error in getting wireless to work, performing sudo conary updateall fixed my two major issues, including the wired ethernet and my sound.</description>

The following is a very long post, including the laptop’s specs, installing Foresight, and some of the challenges I have figured out or am trying to overcome in getting Foresight Linux.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to read a very long post, you can stop now. The short version of this story, is that after a user error in getting wireless to work, performing <code>sudo conary updateall</code> fixed my two major issues, including the wired ethernet and my sound. I wasn’t even done typing this blog post, when after performing updateall and then rebooting, all was fixed. If you would like to read about my user errors, and challenges from an out of box experience with a new computer and a default Foresight installation, read on. As I mention at the end of this post, my experience definitely gives me perspective as I help write documentation for Foresight, such as the upcoming Getting Started guide. I’m not an expert Linux user by an means, but I can poke around, and if I had problems with a default install such as below, imagine what a new user to Linux might feel like.</p>
<p><strong>Installing Foresight Linux 1.1 on a Toshiba A135-S4467 Laptop</strong></p>
<p>The laptop is a little larger than I wanted, 5.8 pounds and a 15.4″ widescreen, but the price was definitely right. Speeds and feeds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Core 2 Duo T5200</li>
<li>15.4″ Widescreen (1280×800)</li>
<li>1 GB RAM</li>
<li>160 GB 5400 RPM Hard Drive</li>
<li>DVD-RW/DL</li>
<li>Intel 3945ABG wireless</li>
<li>Realtek 8101E 10/100 NIC</li>
<li>4 in 1 card reader</li>
<li>1394 mini / 4 USB</li>
</ul>
<p>In researching a laptop purchase, I knew I wanted a Core 2 Duo, even a lower end one, at least 1 GB Ram, a widescreen screen, and as many Intel components as I could. The hard drive is much bigger than what I’ll need in a laptop, and I love having a DVD-RW. According to some reviews I read, I basically traded a larger hard drive for a weaker battery against a comparable Dell, and that’s a trade-off I’ll take, as my primary purpose is to use it in the family room. I plan on keeping up on my writing for Foresight, including Wiki pages, things such as the Getting Starting guided, and contributing to the marketing efforts (and a surprise to be named later) as I camp out on the couch in front of the big TV. Secondary use will be portable, to the local LUG, or for trips home to Milwaukee.</p>
<p>I’ll preface this next section by saying, even after using only Linux for the last two years and off and on for 6 years before that, I’m still not an expert by any means. Google and how-to’s are my friend, and I barely can work my way around the command line in loading modules in to the kernel or what not.</p>
<p>I’ve run in to a couple of gotcha’s along the way. It turns out a couple are user error so far, and a few I haven’t figured out yet. They could be issues with Foresight, as I did test the latest Ubuntu Feisty Fawn LiveCD, which did work. This isn’t a criticism of Foresight – I love Foresight, and I love being on the cutting edge. That, and Ubuntu has an army of developers and volunteers, and we don’t…yet. I mention this as maybe they’re a few things to work on in the future, as one reason I bought this laptop is it appeared to use fairly standard hardware.</p>
<p>Installation took just over an hour, about 80 minutes, using the 2 Foresight CDs. As I mentioned in yesterday’s post, I just blew away Vista without ever booting in to it, formatted the hard drive and away we went. Installation appeared to be as normal as it was on the 3 other desktops I’ve installed Foresight on, if just a touch longer.</p>
<p>On my first boot, it hangs for 3 minutes on the sound card, with the error appearing on the screen:</p>
<p><code>EIP: [&lt;f89f7e63&gt;]  get_input_type+0x59/0x80 [snd_hda_codec] SS:ESP 0068:f7563e7c&lt;br /&gt; udevd-event[952]: run_program: ;/sbin/modprobe' abnormal exit&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/f89f7e63&gt;</code></p>
<p>It then continues to load modules, and tells me the Intel 3945ABG module not found – this is the built-in wireless. I knew from past Foresight installs that the firmware is included in the default install, I’ve even seen it checking to see if the module should be loaded on my desktop. It’s one reason I bought this laptop as I knew it should be compatible. We’ll come back to this in a bit.</p>
<p>It then hangs on trying to load eth0 for about 2-3 minutes. (Which always seems longer than it really is). It gets past that with an “OK”, tries to load video, and just hangs for about 10 minutes at which I reboot.</p>
<p>Similar process, pause on the sound, Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG not found, pause at eth0, and then X loads, and I’m prompted to finish the installation by creating a user.</p>
<p>Success! I’m in. I’m quite happy to see that the Battery Applet is installed by default, as Foresight and GNOME recognize I’m running on a laptop.</p>
<p>Network manager doesn’t see an eth0, and wireless doesn’t work. That’s ok, I’m all about the eye candy, so I go to work on getting my xorg.conf setup. After using Google, I edit my xorg.conf and replace “vesa” with “i810”, and also add the 1280×800 resolutions. I ctrl-alt-backspace to restart X, and I’m still in 800×600, but my xorg.conf looks right. I reboot, same thing. Asking for help in IRC, Thilo points me at System –&gt; Display. I’ve never seen that before, but I choose the Intel i810 driver there, restart X, run it again, choose my resolution, and I’m now using the Intel driver. Compiz works as normal – just enable the applet, set a couple preferences for wobby windows and such, and I have my eye candy! Performance is better than expected – I can grab a window and throw it around the screen with animations, and you really have to know what you’re looking for to see it hiccup at all.</p>
<p>I have my visuals, so it’s time to go for sound. I click on the Volume applet, and two dialog boxes immediately pop up:</p>
<p>Dialog box 1:</p>
<p><code>The volume control did not find any elements and / or devices to control.  This means eitehr that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that you don't have a sound card configured.</code></p>
<p>Dialog box 2:</p>
<p><code>No volume control GStreamer plugins and / or devices found</code></p>
<p>At this point it was getting late, so I threw in the latest Ubuntu Feisty Beta LiveCD, and my wired NIC and sound worked. It was nice to confirm the laptop wasn’t defective, but showed I still had a way to go in getting the laptop working with Foresight.</p>
<p>I got home from work today, and went back at it. The default kernel in a Foresight Linux 1.1 installation is 2.6.19.2-0.2 – according to one forum posting I found, this should control my NIC just fine, as it was added in 2.6.19.1. I’m stumped on that one, but you can see my <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/misc/gnome/dmesg.txt">dmesg output</a>. It recognizes the right card, but it’s not active in NetworkManager or System – Admin- Network. Doing a “lspci | grep Ethernet” also shows RTL8101E PCI Express Fast Ethernet Controller (rev 01).</p>
<p>In browsing through dmesg, lo and behold, it tells me my wireless radio is off. Aha! So I hit function – F8 to turn it on, but Network Manager doesn’t see it. I reboot twice, and still nothing. I flip through the user manual, which is absolutely worthless, as it doesn’t cover any of the function keys on the laptop, nor does it bother to tell me there is a toggle switch under the keyboard out of sight, that by default is turned off, which just happens to be the wireless radio. Flip that on, a pretty green light turns on, reboot, and voila, wireless. Choose my network in Network Manager, enter the WEP key and now we are in business. I then proceed to grumble under my breath about Toshiba’s default configuration out of the box.</p>
<p>With the exception of the sound and wired NIC issue, I’m pretty happy so far. I have 3D effects working, after some user error, the wireless is working (and I’ve done my conary updateall), and the laptop feels quite snappy. I haven’t ventured into suspend and resume yet, as we all know how challenging that can sometimes be in Linux. The other item on my to-do list is to get scrolling working on my Synaptics touchpad.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, my first updateall made this the sound and wired ethernet work perfectly. A big shout out to the Foresight developers for how fast they update the distro in being able to fix those kind of issues. This is just my story and experience, and yours will vary. This experience, and the things I learned, definitely give me perspective as I start to write a Getting Started with Foresight guide – if I learned new things, such as setting up the Display, imagine what a person totally new to Linux might feel like.</p>

            <title>Microsoft Vista:  0 for 3</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2007/03/microsoft-vista-0-for-3/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2007 01:22:47 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2007/03/microsoft-vista-0-for-3/</guid>
            <description>Microsoft is now 0 for 3 in trying to get me to try Vista. My recent Intel motherboard / Core 2 Duo processor purchase included a copy of Vista when Vista shipped. Surprisingly, Microsoft supplied Intel with both a 32 bit and 64 bit version to send out, each with unique keys.
It’s sat on my desk since it arrived in the mail a month ago, unopened. I have a friend who I think wants a copy.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is now 0 for 3 in trying to get me to try Vista. My recent Intel motherboard / Core 2 Duo processor purchase included a copy of Vista when Vista shipped. Surprisingly, Microsoft supplied Intel with both a 32 bit and 64 bit version to send out, each with unique keys.</p>
<p>It’s sat on my desk since it arrived in the mail a month ago, unopened. I have a friend who I think wants a copy. I looked at ebaying it, but I was surprised how low OEM copies really sell for, so so it sits here.</p>
<p>Today I bought a new laptop, a <a href="http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/pdet.to?poid=360027&amp;coid=-32796&amp;src=MAXG&amp;cm_mmc=google_sem-_-brand-_-satellite_a135-_-toshiba_a135&amp;gclid=CM_5zf2akYsCFR0CPwodMFQxWA">Toshiba Satellite A135-S4467</a>, with Vista Home Premium on it. I didn’t even boot it up. Plugged in the battery, a Foresight disc, reformatted the hard drive, installed Foresight and blew away the Vista partition without so much as even looking at what Microsoft is offering these days.</p>
<p>I then used Google a bit to search for tips and tricks to get my Microsoft refund from the OEM. I found some good sites, <a href="http://community.linux.com/community/07/01/03/227237.shtml?tid=12">one in particular on Linux.com</a>, that details what to say to a customer service rep and when to hold firm. The site makes it clear to be able to quote from the EULA, so after a bit of searching, I found Toshiba’s Master End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>They got me. I think Toshiba has figured out how to avoid that scenario, as the first paragraph, in glorious all capital letters, makes it clear you’re better off returning the whole thing than trying to get a refund:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…TAIS DOES NOT ACCEPT THE THE RETURN OF PRO-RATA REFUNDS ON INDIVIDUAL PC COMPONENTS OR BUNDLE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING THE OPERATING SYSTEM… IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, DO NOT INSTALL, COPY OR USE THE SOFTWARE. IF YOU WISH TO RETURN A COMPLETE HARDWARE PRODUCT STEYM, CONTACT…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darn. Later on, in Limitation of Liability, again in all capital letters (what l33t hacker writes EULAs?!):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TAIS ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THIS EULA SHALL NOT EXCEED U.S. $10.00….</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I’m not a lawyer, but I think even if I sweet talked them into giving me money for this wonderful thing called Vista, I’m entitled to $10.00. Oh boy! A new CD! Wait, the RIAA makes us pay more than $10.00 for those too. Oh boy! A free lunch!</p>
<p>Leave a comment if you know a good work around or have some advice for me to try. If Spam Karma 2 kicks in and moderates the comment, please use the feedback form to let me know.</p>
<p>My thoughts and notes on installing Foresight on the laptop will be coming soon, too.</p>

            <description>Epiphany is the default web browser for GNOME, and now as of Foresight 1.1, Foresight Linux.
What is Epiphany? Epiphany is the browser for the GNOME desktop, with it’s goal to be simple and easy to use. Powered by the Gecko engine, like Firefox, Epiphany offers extensions, customizable user interface, and smart bookmarks.
Luis Villa recently published a link of things, in his opinion, Epiphany did superior to Firefox. (No, I’m not trying to start a flamewar, just food for thought on why you might want to try Epiphany!</description>

            <description>First of all, thank you for inviting me to join the Planet crowd – I’m very flattered and honored to be part of the community.
Who am I? I’m a married father of 3 living just outside of Minneapolis, MN USA, and when the kids aren’t keeping me busy, trying to learn how to contribute and help out with various projects, including Banshee, GNOME and Foresight Linux. I’ve been using Linux for just over 8 years, a number of various distributions over that time, but was primarily a Red Hat Linux user, and then an Ubuntu user for the last couple of years before making the switch to Foresight about a month ago.</description>

<p>Who am I? I’m a married father of 3 living just outside of Minneapolis, MN USA, and when the kids aren’t keeping me busy, trying to learn how to contribute and help out with various projects, including <a href="http://www.banshee-project.org">Banshee</a>, <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> and <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org">Foresight Linux</a>. I’ve been using Linux for just over 8 years, a number of various distributions over that time, but was primarily a Red Hat Linux user, and then an Ubuntu user for the last couple of years before making the switch to Foresight about a month ago. This month marks the two year anniversary of using Linux as my only operating system on all my computers.</p>
<p>I am also an active believer and supporter of the <a href="http://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the current areas I’m targeting to help out with are <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/docs">documentation</a>, including a <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/docs/Getting+Started+with+Foresight+Linux">Getting Started guide</a> for users new to Foresight Linux; documenting the LiveCD release for both Foresight and GNOME; and helping out with <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/marketing/Marketing+Plan+1.1">marketing</a> once that’s gets going. And who can forget submitting and triaging <a href="https://issues.foresightlinux.org/">bugs</a>!</p>
<p>This feed is my Linux RSS feed – if you want more ramblings on anything from copyright to sports to books and movies, feel free to visit my <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog">blog</a>, which I probably need to update more often. You can also find me on IRC on Gimpnet and Freenode as “silwenae”, <a href="http://mugshot.org/person?who=XA0x1RVFQWMbS0">Mugshot</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us/silwenae">del.icio.us</a>. My handle / alias “silwenae” was a randomly generated name from an online roleplaying game that has stuck with me these last 7 or 8 years.</p>
<p>Thank you to the Foresight community for being so welcoming, and I look forward to helping out.</p>

            <description>We are now one day away from the GNOME 2.18 release! If you didn’t download and test GNOME 2.18 yet (as I mentioned in yesterday’s post), Phoronix has posted some GNOME 2.18 screenshots from the GNOME / Foresight 2.18 LiveCD for your viewing pleasure.
Take a look at some screenshots, and get ready for the release.
In related GNOME news, the newly revamped GNOME website won’t be ready for 2.18 – but give us a month and we’ll have it ready for GNOME 2.</description>

            <description>GNOME 2.18 is 2 days from release – have you taken it for a test drive yet? Thanks to Ken Vandine and Foresight Linux, there is now more than just one way to take GNOME 2.18 for a spin. VMWare images, QEMU / Parallels, name your virtualization way and there’s probably an image, in addition to a LiveCD.
Visit the downloads page and pick your way to test out GNOME. Links will be updated once 2.</description>

            <title>Conary Packaging System</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2007/03/conary-packaging-system/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2007 14:02:26 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2007/03/conary-packaging-system/</guid>
            <description>Linux.com has a good article up with an overview of the Conary packaging system, developed by rPath and in use by Foresight Linux. The article covers a high level overview, managing packages with Conary, and it’s future prospects.
 Conary relies upon a repository that is also a source control system, complete with branches and diff-like files called changesets that identify differences between the available versions of a package. Where the leading package systems identify packages only by version number, each name in a Conary repository is a unique identifier that includes such information as a package’s location in the repository, the upstream version number, the source revision, the number of the binary build, and the specific hardware architecture for which it is intended.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://enterprise.linux.com/enterprise/07/02/26/219240.shtml?tid=129&amp;tid=23">Linux.com has a good article up</a> with an overview of the <a href="http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary">Conary packaging system</a>, developed by rPath and in use by <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org">Foresight Linux</a>. The article covers a high level overview, managing packages with Conary, and it’s future prospects.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That might sound like a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, but what I’ve taken away from my brief time in the #foresight IRC channel on Freenode, is Conary is really about updating packages based on the new file changes – not having to compile from source the entire package to get to a binary, but just the changes needed to update that package or file.</p>
<p>Conary is the backbone behind <a href="http://www.rpath.org">rPath</a> – and if you have an opportunity, poke around <a href="http://www.rpath.org">rPath</a> and see how many different people are using it to create their own customized distributions and software deployment solutions (or as rPath calls them, appliances). From a NAS project to Foresight Linux to Wiki applications to LAMP, mail or VOIP servers, users, developers and companies are finding that <a href="http://www.rpath.org">rPath</a> has made a toolset and packaging system to enable appliances everyone can use.</p>
<p>The article closes with a good summary, and a great shout out to <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org">Foresight Linux</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So far as rPath is concerned, Conary seems less an end in itself than a tool to help build the virtual appliances that are the company’s main business. Conary is used in rPath Linux, but because rPath Linux is primarily a tool that others can use to create customized distros, the best place to see Conary action is with one of the distributions built using rPath Linux and rBuilder Online, rPath’s tool that distros can use to manage the production of their versions. Of these distributions, one of the most advanced is Foresight, which specializes in providing bleeding-edge versions of GNOME.</p>

            <description>It’s official: I’ve switched to Foresight from Ubuntu on my main computer. As I posted a few days ago in my review of Foresight, I’ve been really impressed with the distribution and the community around Foresight. The community was what made the decision easy. I would have never believed even two weeks ago that I’d have a different distribution than Ubuntu on my computer, but here we are.

As I posted a few days ago in my review of Foresight, I’ve been really impressed with the distribution and the community around Foresight. The community was what made the decision easy. I would have never believed even two weeks ago that I’d have a different distribution than Ubuntu on my computer, but here we are.</p>
<p>Installed the brand new <a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/foresight/release?id=5398">1.01 release</a> this morning, installed and configured everything to my needs (Nvidia Drivers, Compiz, Bluefish, etc), restored my data, and I’m all set. Copying my music over and importing in to Banshee as we speak. I need to learn how to install a development package, Jokosher specifically, so I can get back to creating my first Podcast. (Audacity isn’t in the repos, as it isn’t a GNOME-ish application).</p>
<p>I’ve signed up for the <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/community/">mailing lists</a>, created my <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/dashboard.action">Wiki</a> and <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/dashboard.action">Bug Tracking</a> accounts (and submitted my first bug report), and look forward to joining, and more importantly, contributing to the Foresight community.</p>

            <description>As I mentioned in my last post, I installed Foresight Linux on my second box last week. (Don’t worry Ubuntu fans, I’m still running Feisty on my main machine). To set expectations, this post is part mini-review of Foresight, part comparison to Ubuntu, and just my opinions and thoughts on Foresight after using another distribution for almost 3 years.
Foresight’s website and IRC channel sum up Foresight well:

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned in my last post, I installed <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/">Foresight Linux</a> on my second box last week. (Don’t worry Ubuntu fans, I’m still running Feisty on my main machine). To set expectations, this post is part mini-review of Foresight, part comparison to Ubuntu, and just my opinions and thoughts on Foresight after using another distribution for almost 3 years.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/">Foresight’s website</a> and IRC channel sum up Foresight well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Foresight Linux is a Distribution which showcases some of the latest and greatest from GNOME. Ah! Some of the things that may not be mature enough for some of the other distros. Some of the more innovative things are included, like beagle , f-spot , avahi (zeroconf), and the latest hal . All of this plus some nice, clean default themes and artwork.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>And their IRC channel: “Your distro should be cool”. And that’s a great way to sum up the applications included on their CDs.</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>It was weird seeing an option to download more than 1 CD – Foresight comes on 2 CDs or one DVD image. I used bittorrent to spare rPath some bandwidth, and it was fast – 600k down, which makes me wonder how many folks are out there using this and sharing the ISO.</p>
<p>I burned the DVD on my Ubuntu box, popped it in to my second box, and was greeted with a blast from the past: the Anaconda installer. Prior to becoming an Ubuntu user, I mostly used Red Hat and later Fedora for almost 5 years. Going through Foresight’s installation GUI, while branded Foresight, is a re-branded Fedora install, and there’s nothing wrong with that, it worked great. My box is pretty standard hardware – P4 3.0ghz, Intel stock 865 board, Nvidia (BFG) 6800, 2 DVD drives, 2 IDE Hard drives, and 2 gigs of RAM.</p>
<p>Installation was quick, a reboot, a little more configuration, and I was presented with the Foresight desktop.</p>
<p><strong>Visuals</strong></p>
<p>It’s a nice clean look – it looks to be a custom theme, with Tango-ified icons everywhere. I’ve been using Ubuntu so long, I’m not sure, but I’m guessing this is very close to a default GNOME install. The GNOME footsteps are in the upper left corner with the Applications menu – it’s been a while since I’ve seen those.</p>
<p>There were a couple new icons I haven’t seen before in my notification area in my panel – one is Glipper, a clipboard manager for GNOME, which I’m excited to see. GNOME’s lack of unified copy / paste is a constant minor annoyance, so that program is slick. The other icon was Desktop Drapes, a tool for managing your wallpapers. It’s a slick application, but I’m not sure the necessity of having it on my panel. The last was a window selector button on the far right of the panel that has uses the icon of the application in the foreground. Clicking on the window selector brings up a menu of all active applications to make it quicker to switch between them.</p>
<p><strong>Customizing Foresight</strong></p>
<p>Once installed, I need to feed my addiction to eye-candy. It was time to get my Nvidia drivers installed. Foresight uses a new package manager called Conary, which is developed by rPath to create their appliances. Conary is unlike any other package manager in that it keeps every version of a file every made, so you can just rollback if you encounter a problem. It also does incremental updates, and from I understand, when you’re updating a package, Conary is just pulling down the changed bits of the file – you don’t need a whole binary.</p>
<p>But back to the Nvidia drivers – I followed the wiki and added the binary drivers to my group:</p>
<p><code>&lt;br /&gt; sudo conary update group-dist=['!ati, nvidia']</code></p>
<p>And then I sat there at a terminal. It was probably about 5 minutes, but felt like about 15. I pinged some developers as I was lurking in the #foresight channel on Freenode, and sure enough, soon as I asked after a few minutes, it started. The delay was caused because my system needed to be updated as it was a fresh install. So all kinds of packages had updates available since the ISO I burned was built.</p>
<p>As part of the updates, the Nvidia drivers were installed, so I restarted X, got the Nvidia splash screen, was able to change my resolution from 800×600 to 1280×1024, and lo and behold, I had a new icon on my panel. It looked like some paint splattered – it was new to me. Compiz! Installed and able to run as soon as the binary drivers were installed – very slick. I enabled a GL desktop, and voila – there it was. I had a couple edits to make to my X.org file <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.org/confluence/display/docs/How+to+install+ATI+or+nVidia+Binary+Drivers">per the Foresight Wiki</a> for Nvidia cards, applied those changes and had a fully enabled GL desktop running without really lifting a finger. I’ve been using Beryl pretty exclusively with my Edgy and Feisty desktops, but after using Compiz for the last few days here, I don’t see why I would go back to Beryl. This is what Ubuntu users have to look forward to with this week’s announcement of Compiz being installed by default in Feisty – same as this, just enable it and away you go.</p>
<p><strong>Applications</strong></p>
<p>I’ve installed a few other programs, including Bluefish and Mugshot. Foresight’s default choice for applications are perfect for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Banshee is the only music manager (no Rhythmbox, and even better it’s not the default like Ubuntu)</li>
<li>Xchat</li>
<li>Brasero for burning (haven’t used that yet, but looking forward to it as I’ve primarily used Gnomebaker up until now),</li>
<li>gDesklets</li>
<li>Epiphany and Firefox (I think Firefox is default, at least that’s what comes up when you start the Foresight System Manager which is a web-based app)</li>
<li>Last-exit for listening to Last.fm streams</li>
<li>F-spot, my favorite photo manager</li>
</ul>
<p>These are applications I use every day, and every time I complete an Ubuntu installation, my first task is to add these. And they’re out of the box on Foresight.</p>
<p>I did try to install avant-window-navigator, and it’s in my menu, but it Segfaults when i run it. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m using Compiz instead of Beryl, a dependency issue, or something else I’ve done. AWN is also in an extremely early alpha stage, so it’s probably a bad example to even bring up. But my real point is wow! It’s a package that’s actually available for automagical installation, that’s cutting edge. It’s an advantage a smaller distro with active package maintainers can bring. <a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/repos/foresight/browse">Click here</a> to browse Foresight’s available packages.</p>

<p>Foresight comes with the Foresight System Manager installed in your System menu on your panel as well in Applications under Foresight. It’s a web based app installed locally on your machine, that gives you some basic status information about y our machine. Accessing the Logs resulted in an “unrecoverable error” in my web browser, but everything else seemed to work. For users scared of the command line, probably the most useful tool is the ability to search for other packages and software, and install them right from your browser.</p>
<p>From the command line, adding and removing applications is a breeze – consistent with my experiences with Apt.</p>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<p>Codecs appear to just work. I could play and rip MP3s, a couple different video files I tried just played. That’s a huge win for users. I understand some folk’s in the open source community’s feelings on the matter, but it’s a necessary evil. Just “making it work” is big.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Foresight has been around for about 2 years, and had their 1.0 release this past January. It appears to be a very active community, especially in their IRC channel, where folks are helpful, friendly and the conversation is always going. Their wiki is up to date with helpful howtos, and for what appears to be a small team of developers, the number of packages being maintained and able to install in Foresight is surpisingly large. The development team is working on a new release to sync up with the upcoming GNOME 2.18 release in March, and is also working on a LiveCD.</p>
<p>I’m really impressed – as a long time Ubuntu user, this is the first distro that really makes me consider switching. I want to get much more active in the Linux communities, and Foresight is one I could see myself helping out, as it has a great bunch of people working on it who were friendly to folks asking questions, and shared information about their distro even with newbies who knew nothing about Linux as I witnessed just a few hours ago tonight.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of using Linux is choice, and Foresight would make a great choice for a lot of users.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank a few folks hanging out in the IRC channel who shared information about Foresight I used in this article, including kenvandine, smithj, pscott and bertux.</p>
<p>Update: Here’s a screenshot of my current Foresight desktop, fairly vanilla from the installation, running Nvidia binary drivers and Compiz:</p>

            <description>I’ve been trying to spend some time giving back to projects I believe in. I spent a weekend reading through Ubuntu wiki pages on everything from setting up a LoCo, to helping the documentation team, becoming an Ubuntu member, and a lot more. After being a little overwhelmed by some of Ubuntu’s processes (and I do understand why they have them considering the sheer number of users and folks involved), I volunteered to help write some copy for the new gnome.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been trying to spend some time giving back to projects I believe in. I spent a weekend reading through Ubuntu wiki pages on everything from setting up a LoCo, to helping the documentation team, becoming an Ubuntu member, and a lot more. After being a little overwhelmed by some of Ubuntu’s processes (and I do understand why they have them considering the sheer number of users and folks involved), I volunteered to help write some copy for the new <a href="http://www.gnome.org">gnome.org</a> website that will debut with the upcoming 2.18 release, take a crack at creating a GNOME 2.18 LiveCD, and am helping to try and get the <a href="http://www.tclug.org/">TCLUG</a> back up and running some regular meetings.</p>
<p>I spent a good chunk of last weekend trying to create a LiveCD, using scripts, a few different programs, and lots of research. I quickly realized I was just a bit, to put it mildly, over my head. I’ve been using Linux off and on for 8 years, a full time user for 2 years, but I’m a user, not a developer. I can barely compile my own packages, and even then I’m sure I’m not always doing it the “right” way.</p>
<p>In my travels in trying to build a LiveCD, I met a gentleman by the name of <a href="http://ken.vandine.org/">Ken Vandine</a> on the gnome-marketing mailing list and in the #marketing IRC channel for GNOME, who has also stepped up to create a LiveCD for GNOME 2.18. Ken works for <a href="http://www.rpath.com">rPath</a>, whose goal is “<a href="http://www.rpath.com/corp/about-us.html">making software applications radically easier to create, deploy, and manage</a>“. Coincidentally, at our last TCLUG installfest last summer, Dave from rPath demoed their technology for us, showing us a really innovative way to create your own software, including things as complex as your own Linux distribution using their toolset. But back to Ken – not only did Ken seem pretty cool and helpful, turns out Ken is one of, if not the lead developer for <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/">Foresight Linux</a>.</p>
<p>Foresight is a GNOME-based distribution, that includes a lot of cutting edge software in the Linux community, including <a href="http://www.banshee-project.org">Banshee</a> as the default music manager (and we know how much I love Banshee), F-spot, Beagle, among others. I think it’s safe to safe to say Foresight is a smaller Linux distribution when compared to leaders like Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo or Ubuntu.</p>
<p>I did something last Sunday I have done in almost 3 years – installed a different distribution of Linux that wasn’t Ubuntu. It was weird, but strangely comforting at the same time. I’ll post some thoughts on my experiences with Foresight later tonight in my next post.</p>

            <description>I was pleasantly suprised to see that Banshee is now supported by Mugshot. I’ve been running Feisty for the last few weeks, and haven’t found a Mugshot .deb yet, but on my second machine I was testing out Foresight (different story for later), which had an up to date package for Mugshot. I was playing music on my main PC, look over to my second PC with Mugshot, and it’s reporting what songs I’ve just played.</description>

I’ve been running Feisty for the last few weeks, and haven’t found a Mugshot .deb yet, but on my second machine I was testing out Foresight (different story for later), which had an up to date package for Mugshot. I was playing music on my main PC, look over to my second PC with Mugshot, and it’s reporting what songs I’ve just played. What a pleasant suprise! Talking to <a href="http://abock.org">Aaron Bockover</a> in IRC, it wasn’t developed by Banshee, so I’m guessing the lads at Red Hat are grabbing it via Dbus in the latest version of Mugshot.</p>
<p>In other Banshee news, Snorp has created a <a href="http://www.snorp.net/log/2007/02/28/banshee-and-awn/">Banshee plugin for Avant Window Navigator</a>. The plugin replaces the Banshee logo in your dock with the cover art from the current CD you’re playing. Make sure you have a newer version of AWN from Subversion – my AWN build from a week or two wasn’t compatible as Banshee would just keep crashing on Feisty.</p>

            <description>With some help from Pveith on the Ubuntu Forums, I was able to compile Avant Window Navigator from Subversion. Per Pveith’s recommendation, I used checkinstall, which created a .deb for installation. I am running Beryl and an Nvidia graphics card. I added a Feisty Fawn Howto on the AWN wiki, here is how I got it working:

            <title>Ubuntu Feisty Fawn Herd 4 Random Thoughts</title>

            <description>I took the plunge and installed Feisty Fawn Herd 4 on my main machine last night. Doing a dist-upgrade resulted in kernel panic when GRUB tried to load, so I threw in the Herd 4 CD, and did a clean install. (I know, I should be installing alpha software on my main machine, but it’s running so smooth so far…)
If you haven’t checked out Feisty Fawn yet, check out the wiki pages on Ubuntu.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I took the plunge and installed Feisty Fawn Herd 4 on my main machine last night. Doing a dist-upgrade resulted in kernel panic when GRUB tried to load, so I threw in the Herd 4 CD, and did a clean install. (I know, I should be installing alpha software on my main machine, but it’s running so smooth so far…)</p>
<p>If you haven’t checked out Feisty Fawn yet, check out the wiki pages on Ubuntu.com for the different alpha releases (<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/herd2">Herd 2</a>, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/herd3">Herd 3</a>, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/herd4">Herd 4)</a>.</p>
<p>It’s amazing to see how far Feisty has come just through the alpha releases.</p>
<p>Some random thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Codec installation is awesome. (See the Herd 4 link above). I tried playing a MP3 in movie player, it downloaded the MP3 codec, installed it, and it played. I then fired up Banshee, and Banshee played MP3 files just fine.</li>
<li>Looking at the Herd 4 page, the Migration Assistant has been included. I’ve been <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MigrationAssistance?highlight=%28migration%29">following the Wiki page</a> for that since it went live. Though I don’t dual boot anymore, this is one of the projects I’m very excited about, as this will help in a big way to get users from Windows to Linux, and Ubuntu specifically. I may play around with my last Windows machine just to try this out. If you dual boot, please help test this.</li>
<li>My Sansa e260 MP3 player now shows up as a digital music player, and not a USB disk. Still can’t write to it in Banshee though.</li>
<li>Beryl works like a champ using their repositories.</li>
<li>Gnomebaker still wants root. I don’t know if this is because I’m using a SATA burner or not, but I <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=650">applied the fix I previously blogged</a> for Edgy.</li>
<li>I got Avant Window Navigator working with some help, I’ll post the how-to after this.</li>
<li>Feisty fixed my microphone problems I <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=664">ranted about last night</a>. Not out of the box, but it was quick. I double clicked on Volume Control on my panel, clicked “Edit”, “Preferences”, “Capture”. Then went to the Recording tab in Volume control, moved the slider bar up, and bam, my mic works in Sound Recorder and Audacity. Thank goodness!
Herd 4 seems stable so far, and I know the risk I’m running in potential breakage as the betas and release come up over the next few weeks. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>

            <description>I love Linux – last month was my 8 year anniversary of using Linux in some form, and next month will be the 2 year anniversary of using Linux as my only operating system when I retired from gaming.
I love Ubuntu – I love the community, the developers committed to making Linux (and Debian) better (and easier), and the wealth of applications.
But some things drive me crazy about Linux, and today’s rant is about trying to get my microphone jack to work.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love Linux – last month was my 8 year anniversary of using Linux in some form, and next month will be the 2 year anniversary of using Linux as my only operating system when I retired from gaming.</p>
<p>I love Ubuntu – I love the community, the developers committed to making Linux (and Debian) better (and easier), and the wealth of applications.</p>
<p>But some things drive me crazy about Linux, and today’s rant is about trying to get my microphone jack to work. It’s little things like this, that in my mind should <em>just work</em>, but don’t. If you search the Ubuntu Forums for microphone, it’s amazing <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/search.php?searchid=14706032">how many threads pop up</a> that folks can’t get their mics to work.</p>
<p>I have an Intel HDA audio card built in to my motherboard. I spent a good 4 hours today trying different things to get it to work. When I started, I could listen to audio through my speakers and in my headset at the same time. Now I can’t, after changing some setting I’m not aware of. I spent hours playing with Alsamixer, Alsamixergui, Volume Control, and Sound settings. I tried to record using 2 different boom mics, different ports, different options in Sound Recorder and Volume Control, editing alsa files, all to no avail.</p>
<p>I have a slightly newer motherboard, though stock Intel, with a Core 2 Duo processor. Most threads I saw had problems with the Conexant chip, and I have a Sigmatel. It could be anything – it could be I’ve messed with my settings and hosed it myself, it could be that I’m running Ubuntu Edgy and in the last 6 months either Ubuntu or Alsa have a fix, and I’m just running an old version, or my hardware is still to new and folks are out there hacking on it without an answer yet.</p>
<p>It’s maddening, but I’ll keep trying, and when I figure it out, I’ll post an answer and help out the next folks who get stuck. But I may just install Feisty and see if I have better luck. (I know – it shouldn’t be on a main machine as it hasn’t been released yet, but I’m feeling daring!)</p>

            <description>The 5th time is the charm, as I finally was able to install Avant Window Navigator from subversion today on Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft) with Beryl:

Neil Patel is doing some really innovative work with GNOME right now, from creating Avant Window Navigator to Tracker to including metadata information in to Nautilus. You really must check out his blog to see his work in progress on these projects.
Back to Avant Window Navigator: AWN replaces one of your panels, and shows both what applications are open and a launcher for other applications.</description>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/392490229/" title="Photo Sharing"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Neil Patel is doing some really innovative work with GNOME right now, from creating Avant Window Navigator to <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/tracker/">Tracker</a> to including <a href="http://njpatel.blogspot.com/2007/02/nautilus-love.html">metadata information in to Nautilus</a>. You really must <a href="http://njpatel.blogspot.com/">check out his blog</a> to see his work in progress on these projects.</p>
<p>Back to Avant Window Navigator: AWN replaces one of your panels, and shows both what applications are open and a launcher for other applications.</p>
<p>I had some difficulty getting AWN installed even after reading <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=351186&amp;highlight=avant">this thread on Ubuntu Forums</a> and following the instructions on the <a href="http://awn.wetpaint.com/page/SVN+Version+Installation">AWN Wiki</a>. In the end, I was able to get it installed using Subversion, but I had to change one line from the wiki:</p>
<p>The wiki’s last step says:</p>
<p><code>cd data&lt;br /&gt; gconftool-2 --install-schema-file=avant-window-navigator.schemas</code></p>
<p>But there was no avant-window-navigator.schemas file in the /data directory. So I typed:</p>
<p><code>gconftool-2 --install-schema-file=avant-window-navigator.schemas.in</code></p>
<p>which <em>was</em> a file in the /data directory, and voila, AWN!</p>
<p>I made notes on the screenshot on Flickr, but on the left of the dock are the launcher applications, and on the 4 icons on the right side are the applications currently opened.</p>
<p>I removed the bottom panel once AWN was running, and moved my workspace switcher, show desktop button and trash icon to the panel at the top.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m quite impressed with AWN. It scales the icons beautifully, I like how they move when highlighted, and I love how it’s both a launcher and a switch application tool. Hats off to the developer for this one. It takes some getting used to not seeing a panel at the bottom of the screen after using GNOME all these years, but I have a feeling I’ll adjust.</p>

            <description>Dreamhaven Books on Lake Street in Minneapolis is one of my favorite bookstores that I’ve ever been to. Dreamhaven specializes in science fiction, comic books, and fantasy and horror. Not only does one of my favorite authors frequent there, they have a great collection of new and used books, with some of the deepest catalog selections you’ll see in a book store. They have very rare books, and a large selection of author signed books.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.dreamhavenbooks.com/">Dreamhaven Books</a> on Lake Street in Minneapolis is one of my favorite bookstores that I’ve ever been to. Dreamhaven specializes in science fiction, comic books, and fantasy and horror. Not only does one of my <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.net">favorite authors frequent there</a>, they have a great collection of new and used books, with some of the deepest catalog selections you’ll see in a book store. They have very rare books, and a large selection of author signed books.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2007/02/psst-dreamhaven-pass-it-on.html">Neil Gaiman writes on his blog</a> that Dreamhaven was broken in to Saturday. From the email he received from Greg Ketter, owner of Dreamhaven:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a break-in on Saturday night. They got a bit of cash but wreaked</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>terrible havoc on the store and my office. Damages will be costly but</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>insurance should cover a lot of it. But after the lull in current</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>business, this really will hurt. I don’t like charity but if you could</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>encourage people to maybe buy an extra book off us soon, it may help.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Three bookstores have closed in the Twin Cities in the past two months and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t want to make it four.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hit up <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2007/02/psst-dreamhaven-pass-it-on.html">Neil’s blog for more info</a>. Dreamhaven was the bookstore that sponsored Neil’s reading and showing of Mirrormask late last year for the launch of Neil’s latest book, Fragile Things. This was where I won a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/sets/72157594339596146/">very rare copy of Mr. Gaiman’s Angel’s &amp; Visitations</a>, that was published by, who else, but Dreamhaven books.</p>
<p>I get to Dreamahaven a couple of times a year – and I was just there last Friday spending my birthday money a day before the break-in. Looks like I’m on my way back to pick up an extra book or two to help them out in their time of need.</p>

            <description>Welcome to the first in a new ongoing feature, “Recently Read”. Brief reviews of books I’ve just finished reading, Recently Read starts with G33K Mafia by Rick Dakan. I’ve been taking recommendations from Cory Doctorow, and reading books based on his recommendations and reviews he posts at Boing Boing, and he hasn’t done me wrong yet, starting with Geek Mafia.
Geek Mafia tells the story of Paul Reynolds, a former comic book writer who co-founds a gaming company, and is let go from the company he co-founded a few years later.</description>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Geek Mafia tells the story of Paul Reynolds, a former comic book writer who co-founds a gaming company, and is let go from the company he co-founded a few years later. Paul, while wallowing in his sorrows, meets Chloe, and together Chloe helps him hatch a scheme to get back at his former company. Paul’s adventures continue with Chloe, who leads a small band of con artists, and Paul soon finds himself involved in the underground world of hackers and con artists.</p>
<p>The book is fast paced, and you quickly come to care about the characters. Trying to figure out who’s conning who, Geek Mafia gives you an insider’s view to a seedy side of Silicon Valley you never thought was possible.</p>
<p>After reading Geek Mafia, I visited Rick Dakan’s home on the web, and was surprised to learn he self-published Geek Mafia (which explains a lot of the typos found in the book) and that the book was semi-autobiographical. <a href="http://rickdakan.com/about.htm">Rick co-founded Cryptic Studios</a>, makers or City of Heroes, and was also let go before the game came to fruition. Rick is currently working on a sequel and blogs frequently at <a href="http://rickdakan.com/index.htm">Rickdakan.com</a>.</p>

<p>Step 1: Create your build environment:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get build-dep banshee</code></p>
<p>Step 2: Get the required development packages and configure them:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install libmono-sqlite2.0-cil libmono-cairo2.0-cil libglib2.0-dev&lt;br /&gt; libtool subversion autoconf automake1.9 gnome-common libavahi1.0-cil</code></p>
<p><code>sudo update-alternatives --set automake /usr/bin/automake-1.9</code></p>
<p><code>sudo ldconfig</code></p>
<p>Step 3: Remove Banshee 0.11.1:</p>
<p><code>&lt;br /&gt; sudo apt-get remove banshee</code></p>
<p>Step 4: Get Banshee from Subversion:</p>
<p><code>svn co http://svn.gnome.org/svn/banshee/trunk/banshee</code></p>
<p>Step 5: Build Banshee 0.11.6 with Avahi support:</p>
<p><code>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --enable-avahi --disable-docs</code></p>
<p><code>make</code></p>
<p><code>sudo make install</code></p>
<p>And run Banshee!</p>
<p>I have to say I really like the Internet Radio plugin, the layout is well done and the icons look great. Banshee feels snappier overall as well.</p>
<p>If I feel really brave, I may try to get MTP working later this week.</p>

            <description>I installed Ubuntu’s latest alpha release, the Feisty Fawn Herd 3, this morning on my development machine. Herd 2 had a bug that wouldn’t install, but Herd 3 installed like a champ.
I’m not going to put up any screenshots – since the release on Thursday, there are plenty of sites that have screenshots up.
Some random thoughts and first impressions:
  Network Manager comes installed default now. The icon on the taskbar caught be my surprise.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I installed Ubuntu’s latest alpha release, the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/herd3?highlight=%28feisty%29%7C%28fawn%29">Feisty Fawn Herd 3</a>, this morning on my development machine. Herd 2 had a bug that wouldn’t install, but Herd 3 installed like a champ.</p>
<p>I’m not going to put up any screenshots – since the release on Thursday, there are plenty of sites that have screenshots up.</p>
<p>Some random thoughts and first impressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Network Manager comes installed default now. The icon on the taskbar caught be my surprise. I installed on a desktop with a wired connection, but now I’m itching to go install Herd 3 on my extra laptop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control Center is more intuitive than I expected. For whatever reason, I had in my head that Control Center was just going to be a knockoff of Window’s Control Panel, but it’s not. I like how it groups Hardware, System and Other. The Filter box works very well as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Ubuntu color scheme is the same as usual. It is what it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I installed Compiz from the Ubuntu repositories instead of Beryl, which I’m running on my Edgy Eft / main desktop. I wanted to give Compiz a try and see how it’s different. The best way I can explain it, after only using it for an hour or two now, and not knowing the in’s and out’s of Compiz, is that it seems more vanilla than Beryl. With Beryl being actively developed by the community (not that Compiz isn’t) Beryl seems to have much more eye candy and bells and whistles. I don’t have the stability problem or resources issues others have complained about on Edgy, and Compiz seems to do fine on my Feisty box using the Nvidia binary drivers in the Ubuntu repository. However, installing Compiz out of the box, including the packages compiz, compiz-gnome, and desktop-effects, along with the required dependencies, I had no window borders. The first thread on the Feisty Fawn forums on Ubuntuforums.org didn’t fix it, nor did a post 3 pages in. One post did <a href="http://forum.go-compiz.org/viewtopic.php?t=270">link to the Compiz forums</a>, and doing the following got it to work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>sudo nvidia-xconfig --composite&lt;br /&gt; sudo nvidia-xconfig --render-accel&lt;br /&gt; sudo nvidia-xconfig --allow-glx-with-composite&lt;br /&gt; sudo nvidia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals</code></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.banshee-project.org/Main_Page">Banshee’s</a> latest release, 0.11.5, is included and feels quite snappy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other than that, it doesn’t seem too different from Edgy (yet), but there’s still 2 months of development time to go.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <description>Since I built my new computer a few months back, and installed Ubuntu 6.10 Edgy Eft, I have only been able to burn using sudo. My old machine burned fine without sudo, so I was guessing it was because I’m using a SATA DVD-RW drive.
I found this tip on the Ubuntu forums and it fixed my burning problem – Gnomebaker has no problem working as a normal user after applying this fix.</description>

<p>I <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217472&amp;highlight=gnomebaker+root">found this tip on the Ubuntu forums and it fixed my burning problem</a> – Gnomebaker has no problem working as a normal user after applying this fix.</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>As root (or in a terminal type: <code>sudo gedit  /etc/udev/rules.d/15-local.rules</code> This will create a new file called 15-local.rules. Add a new rule in the file:</p>
<p><code># SCSI devices&lt;br /&gt; BUS==&quot;scsi&quot;, KERNEL==&quot;sg[0-9]&quot;, NAME=&quot;%k&quot;, GROUP=&quot;cdrom&quot;</code></p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>In a terminal type the following (hit enter after each):</p>
<p><code>sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/cdrecord&lt;br /&gt; sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/cdrecord.mmap&lt;br /&gt; sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/X11/cdrecord.mmap&lt;br /&gt; sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/cdrdao&lt;br /&gt; sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/X11/cdrdao</code></p>
<p>That should fix it, especially if you’re running Gnomebaker. If you’re running K3B, run K3Bsetup and hit the above link for more if you’re a KDE user.</p>
<p>Thanks to wilko on the <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/index.php">Ubuntu Forums</a> for posting this fix.</p>

            <description>Two of the more high profile games to be released this year, with already announced Linux versions, have been delayed. Both stories courtesy of Blue’s News.
Activision’s latest quarterly statement highlights ET: Quake Wars has been delayed to their fiscal 2008 year, which runs from April 2007 to March 2008.
Unreal Tournament 2007 has undergone a name change to Unreal Tournament 3, with part of the name change reflecting the title’s delay until later in 2007, when it was originally scheduled for 2006.</description>

            <description>PC World takes a look at the current state of music playback in Linux, reviewing the different music managers available. The features the reviewer was looking for include browsing and searching, playlists, rip and burning, tag editing and playing internet radio streams.
Rhythmbox (B), Banshee (B-), Listen (C+), Amarok (B), and Exaile (C-) are reviewed, with Amarok being the only KDE app tested as the reviewer, like myself, is a GNOME user.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,128636/article.html">PC World takes a look</a> at the current state of music playback in Linux, reviewing the different music managers available. The features the reviewer was looking for include browsing and searching, playlists, rip and burning, tag editing and playing internet radio streams.</p>
<p>Rhythmbox (B), Banshee (B-), Listen (C+), Amarok (B), and Exaile (C-) are reviewed, with Amarok being the only KDE app tested as the reviewer, like myself, is a GNOME user.</p>
<p>Matthew Newton, the reviewer, notes that he’ll keep an eye on Banshee as the development is much faster paced than Rhythmbox, but has had problems with Banshee’s stability. I’ve run development and stable versions of Banshee, both from the Ubuntu repositories and compiling my own, without the problems he references.</p>
<p>There’s no question that music management in Linux is still early, and is one of the killer applications that will need to be developed quickly to help with user adoption to Linux.</p>

            <description>I updated the blog to WordPress 2.1 last night, which has a lots of little updates. The upgrade went perfectly, and my theme and plugins seem to work without any errors.
I finally found the option in WordPress to update the feed to full posts instead of the summaries, which makes the blog much more friendly to RSS readers. A bonus effect is that it fixes the Daily Links post to post in bullet summaries in feedreaders instead of mashing the post in to one paragraph.</description>

Let’s be honest: most women don’t understand males’ fascination with all things fantasy, from baseball to football. But what if they had their own? Base it on Us Weekly, spend dollars against celebrities, and let the fantasy league be played!
 Here’s the beauty of my new league. Let’s say you took a $5 flier on Denise Richards a while back, hoping she and Charlie Sheen would patch things up.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the beauty of my new league. Let’s say you took a $5 flier on Denise Richards a while back, hoping she and Charlie Sheen would patch things up. But when, out of nowhere, she lands in a love triangle with Richie Sambora and Heather Locklear, she suddenly becomes Chris Shelton or Jonny Gomes, a bona fide sleeper! On the downside, I could easily see someone overpaying for Nicole Richie, thinking she might start to date Diddy or seek help for an eating disorder, and when she doesn’t, you’re playing catch-up for five months. See? The possibilities are endless.</p>

            <description>The must have game of 2006 for me is Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. With the Strogg invading Earth, the two sides do battle with unique classes, weapons and vehicles.
The Enemy Territory website has been updated from the placeholder it used to be.
And even better, Gametrailers has the two and half minute trailer in high definition. Watch it in your browser, or click on the link on the right and download the Windows Media or Quicktime HD versions.</description>

I love Web 2.0. The applications that are being built are making my life easier.

<p>I love Web 2.0. The applications that are being built are making my life easier.</p>
<p>Over on the right of this blog, I’ve had my del.icio.us bookmarks listed for sometime. As I’ve come across a new link I find interesting, I use the del.icio.us Firefox plugin to capture it. You can see the links on the right or just visit my <a href="http://del.icio.us/silwenae">del.icio.us userpage</a> and see all my links.</p>
<p>I only use my Firefox bookmarks for stuff I visit everyday. The good news is that del.icio.us’ importer is finally working, so last night I imported all my Firefox bookmarks in to it, and can use del.icio.us to manage all my bookmarks. I have to make them visible, check their tags and sort them, and I’ll be good to go.</p>
<p>The other thing I did this week was something I should have done a long time ago. I forwarded my two @silwenae.com email address to my Gmail account. Gmail’s spam filters are just so superior to anything else I’ve tried, that no spam gets through. I created my labels (which I still think of as tags) in Gmail, set up my filters, and away we go.</p>
<p>I subscribe to a lot of different mailing lists – (<a href="http://www.mn-linux.org">Twin Cities Linux User Group</a>, <a href="http://www.pholist.org/">Pho</a>, and <a href="http://www.banshee-project.org">Banshee</a> to name just a few. Gmail is the best at viewing mailing lists. The way it shows threads is superior to anything I’ve seen in Outlook, Thunderbird or Evolution.</p>
<p>And I can access it all from my mobile phone. (Not that I ever really need to, but still). And I’m looking forward <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/about_whatsnew.html">to adding my picture / avatar</a> for Gmail &amp; Google Talk. (Now if I could just get my friends to drop MSN Messenger for Gtalk, I’d be set!)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The MiniMode Plugin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Podcast Plugin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Radio Plugin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Recommendation Plugin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Banshee-daap plugin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Banshee CVS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything above</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hit the link to get ’em. I decided to be daring, and installed the plugins in my .gnome2/banshee/plugins directory, but only the Recommendation plugin worked. Trying to use the Podcast or MiniMode Plugin would crash the default Dapper Banshee – so make sure you download the Banshee CVS deb!</p>
<p>Thanks Josiah! One of these days I should spend some time and take this the next step – compile CVS weekly and set up an apt repository for Dapper users.</p>

            <description>Via BoingBoing, C.B. Shapiro has written an amazing piece of work, titled “Hark, the Angry Liberal Sings“. I’ll let his words explain, he does a much better job than I ever could, and I couldn’t agree with him more:
 Thereâs been some ink spilled lately denigrating so called âangry liberals,â that is, people who have allegedly lost their right to be taken seriously because they are âangry.â And they are âliberal.</description>

Shapiro has written an amazing piece of work, titled “<em>Hark, the Angry Liberal Sings</em>“. I’ll let his words explain, he does a much better job than I ever could, and I couldn’t agree with him more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thereâs been some <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-boehlert/on-lapdogs-and-richard-co_b_20729.html">ink spilled lately</a> denigrating so called âangry liberals,â that is, people who have allegedly lost their right to be taken seriously because they are âangry.â And they are âliberal.â</p>
<p>Well, I hereby declare myself a charter member in the ALC (Angry Liberal Club).</p>
<p>Sure, at first I felt guilty — what right do I have as a patriotic American to be angry? Or liberal? Oh, I tried to repress the âangry thing,â I tried — if I was asked, I claimed I was a âpeeved moderate.â Or a âmildly upset centrist.â But after much work through âBITâ (Blog Immersion Therapy), I stopped feeling the shame. Iâm coming out of the closet to announce I am an Angry Liberal Guy. And I am pissed.</p>
<p>You might be saying âMan, what are you so angry about, Angry Liberal Guy?â?</p>
<p>Iâve compiled a short (and by no means complete) list just so I could see it all in one place:</p>
<p>Iâm angry about the shredding of the constitutionâ¦illegal wiretapsâ¦falsified intelligenceâ¦secret prisonsâ¦ use of torture as an accepted means of interrogationâ¦Terry Schiavoâ¦the war on scienceâ¦denial of Global Warmingâ¦the fascistic secrecy of our elected officialsâ¦ presidential signings that declare the President above the lawâ¦the breakdown of the wall between church and stateâ¦the outing of a clandestine CIA agent for purely partisan political gainâ¦the corrupting influence of K Streetâ¦ the total sell-out of the legislative process to corporate interestsâ¦ appointments of unqualified cronies at every level of governmentâ¦Harriet Miersâ¦Brownieâ¦Abu Ghraibâ¦ Scooter â¦the complete mismanagement of the war in Iraqâ¦the lies about the complete mismanagement of the war in Iraqâ¦the grotesque budget deficitsâ¦ the pathetic response to Katrinaâ¦ a civil rights division dedicated to undermining civil rightsâ¦an environmental protection agency that refuses to protect the environmentâ¦ (Take a breath, Angry Liberal Guy.)</p>
<p>And Iâm angry about a smug, simple-minded, incompetent, unqualified President, and a press that denies the obvious fact that we have a smug, simple-minded, incompetent unqualified President.</p>
<p>If these things donât make you angry, I have to ask — what the hell is the matter with you?</p>
<p>And what would it take to make you angry? — C.B. Shapiro</p>

            <description>Could Toshiba’s just released HD-DVD player, the HD-A1, really just be a home theater PC disguised as a normal DVD player?
Sure enough, as seen on this blog and in the video, Toshiba’s HD-DVD player contains an IDE HD-DVD drive, P4 2.5 ghz, 1 gig of RAM, and a flash disk running Red Hat’s linux operating system.
As The Digital Bits noted, no wonder it takes the thing a minute to boot up.</description>

<p>Like the blog author above, I’m waiting for Blu-Ray – sure, it’s Sony’s technology, and their track record isn’t the best, but the compression and size opportunities (for the discs) are better with Blu-Ray than HD-DVD.</p>

            <description>The EFF has started a petition to send to Congress regarding the RIAA’s tactics in stopping music piracy.
From the petition:
 We respect reasonable copyright law, but we strongly oppose copyright enforcement that comes at the expense of privacy, due process and fair application of the law.
We urge you, as our representatives in Congress, to stop this madness.
 As of this morning, the petition is at 80,758 signatures – with 100,000 signatures the EFF can send this to the Senate and House Commerce and Judiciary Commitees.</description>

            <description>Ubuntu’s sabdfl, Mark Shuttleworth, has announced the next Ubuntu release after 6.06 Dapper Drake will be the “Edgy Eft”.
What is an eft?

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>slightly unfamiliar and uncharted territory that is perhaps a little out</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of the mainstream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exciting news in Edgy Eft, as posted in the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And here’s why. Edgy is all about cutting edge, perhaps bleeding edge,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>brand new code and infrastructure. It will be the right time to bring in</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>some seriously interesting but definitely edgy new technologies which</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>lay the groundwork for the next wave of Ubuntu development.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So dream a little about Xen for virtualisation, Xgl/AIGLX and other</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>wonderful wobbly window bits, the goodness of Network Manager, a first</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>flirt with multiarch support for true mixed 32-bit and 64-bit computing</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>on AMD64, the interesting possibilities of the SMART package manager…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and other pieces of infrastructure which have appeared tantalisingly</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>on the horizon.</p>
<p>We can afford to take some risks with Dapper+1, because Dapper has turned</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>out so well. We have a great answer for people who need super-solid</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and super-predictable results: Dapper is still fresh, will continue to work</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>on modern hardware for some time, and has plenty of legs in its support</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>cycle left to run.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the reasons that led to my break from my blogging habit over the last month or two was playing with Dapper Drake from Flight 2 on. I’ll post later on my thoughts on Dapper, but even the cutting edge stuff I was playing with, in what will be a Long Term Support release from Ubuntu was amazing – I could play with <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Xgl">XGL/Compiz</a> for hours.</p>
<p>I hope to see things like <a href="http://www.chipx86.com/wiki/Leaftag">Leaftag</a>, <a href="http://www.beatniksoftware.com/gimmie/">Gimmie</a>, and many other goodies in Edgy Eft.</p>

            <description>Team Xbox has an excellent story going through the details of 1080p HDTV vs. 720p and 1080i. Easy to read, it goes through all the technical information you need to know about the next generation HDTVs coming to market, and how Blu-Ray and HD-DVD will play with them.
The last two pages go through TV recommendations, and while I disagree with the writer that DLP is the best way to go, it’s an informative read on the best DLP TVs on the market.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Team Xbox <a href="http://editorials.teamxbox.com/xbox/1544/The-Facts-and-Fiction-of-1080p/p1/">has an excellent story</a> going through the details of 1080p HDTV vs. 720p and 1080i.

<p>The last two pages go through TV recommendations, and while I disagree with the writer that DLP is the best way to go, it’s an informative read on the best DLP TVs on the market. Like the writer, I’ve heard excellent things about the DLPs from Hewlett-Packard – who would have thought a PC maker could make an excellent HDTV?</p>
<p>The writer takes a shot at Sony’s SXRD towards the end, and seems unaware of Sony’s public announcement that their 2nd generation SXRD coming this fall will be 1080p compatible. The fall timeline gives me heartburn – even with the basement flooding putting my basement behind schedule, the SXRD is what I want, and I’ll be ready in June. Sony’s SXRD is a LCoS technology, which is a step ahead of DLP, with better blacks and a better picture.</p>

            <description>I came across this blog post about stealing TV a few days ago: I Steal Television Because I Have To.
The author is spot on – it’s not about theft, it’s about control. And sometimes recording TV something happens you couldn’t control, and you have no way to get the show you wanted to watch. A week ago Tuesday, my Season Pass on my TiVo for The Unit didn’t work. No idea why – no idea what channel it was trying to record, but it recorded a blank screen for an hour.</description>

<p>The author is spot on – it’s not about theft, it’s about control. And sometimes recording TV something happens you couldn’t control, and you have no way to get the show you wanted to watch. A week ago Tuesday, my Season Pass on my TiVo for The Unit didn’t work. No idea why – no idea what channel it was trying to record, but it recorded a blank screen for an hour.</p>
<p>So I went and got the torrent.</p>
<p>The TV industry needs to wake up – and some are. ABC’s announcment this week that they’ll be releasing TV shows the day after – with non-skippable commercials – is a step. It will be interesting to see what the future holds, especially with TV-like content developed and delivered over the internet and not over the air.</p>

            <description>Wired has an article up discussing AT&amp;amp;T’s attempts to get back 140 pages of documents given to the EFF by a whistleblower.
The EFF is suing AT&amp;amp;T based on AT&amp;amp;T’s efforts to assist the NSA in tapping phone calls.
If half what the whistleblower says is true, the government needs to be held accountable for this gross breach of civil liberties. Wiretapping and providing information to the government for U.S. citizens is expressly forbidden by law – but that doesn’t seem to stop the NSA or the current administration.</description>

</ul>
<p>Almost everything was ordered from Newegg and PC Alchemy.</p>
<p>I need to do some more research if I should be using Ubuntu’s 64 bit version with MythTV, I’ve read mixed things. But the AMD x2 should perform extremely well for a HTPC. It won’t be easy getting everything configured, but god knows I’ve been researching it long enough, and now it’s go time.</p>

The torrents didn’t work for me listed on their webpage, but I used the Down Them All extension for Firefox and snapped up the MP3’s and burned ’em to CD (don’t forget to burn without pauses between tracks!)
Enjoy!

<p>The torrents didn’t work for me listed on their webpage, but I used the Down Them All extension for Firefox and snapped up the MP3’s and burned ’em to CD (don’t forget to burn without pauses between tracks!)</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

            <description>I came across a new Linux Blog, Linux Revolution, that has two posts up, near and dear to my heart:
An overview of next-gen Linux games, looking at some of the lesser known games by smaller studios. Some of these I have tried (or installed), including Sauerbraten, and some more I’m definitely going to keep my eye on.
The second article of note is Rhythmbox vs. Banshee. This is an article I’ve been meaning to write myself for some time, but I”m lazy, and haven’t got to it.</description>

This is an article I’ve been meaning to write myself for some time, but I”m lazy, and haven’t got to it. It’s a good overview of the two music players for GNOME, and like the author, I’m a huge Banshee fan. Banshee’s development has been fast and furious, and every release adds key features. I can’t recommend Banshee enough.</p>

            <description>I’ve been following Intel’s new Viiv platform for a while, and Intel confirmed some details this week at a launch event. Viiv is Intel’s latest platform, specifically to enable Media Center functionality in the desktop and in homes. From transcoding ability built-in, automatic driver updates, and ability to transfer content to other devices, Intel is betting that’s it’s the cornerstone of the future home.
The good news is that the hardware won’t check for DRM and watermarks natively.</description>

Viiv is Intel’s latest platform, specifically to enable Media Center functionality in the desktop and in homes. From transcoding ability built-in, automatic driver updates, and ability to transfer content to other devices, Intel is betting that’s it’s the cornerstone of the future home.</p>
<p>The good news is that the hardware won’t check for DRM and watermarks natively. <a href="http://www.cnet.com.au/desktops/pcs/0,39029439,40061064,00.htm">From the CNet Australia article:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, MacDonald also told CNET.com.au that Viiv won’t be testing to see if the content being played is pirated from networks such as BitTorrent. He believes that it’s not Intel’s job to be policing downloads and that it’s wrong to assume that “all consumers are criminals”. As such, Viiv won’t test for “watermarks” or other red flags that reveal pirated content, allowing any type of media to be played.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, MacDonald is confident that piracy won’t be a significant issue for Viiv, as Intel promises to “make content easier to buy than it is to pirate”.</p>

            <description>More reasons why DRM is evil:
Cnet recently conducted a test of MP3 players, and DRM encoded WMA files drained the battery faster than DRM-free MP3s.
 When it comes to the Creative Zen Vision:M’s 14-hour claim, CNET got about 16 hours of playback time with MP3s from a full charge, which was a nice surprise. However, when they tried playing WMA 10 DRM crippled subscription tracks on it, they only got just over 12 hours; a loss of almost 4 hours (~25%) of playback time due to the battery-hungry DRM.</description>

Apple’s FairPlay DRM seems to have less of an effect with battery life being reduced by around 8% when compared with MP3 playback.</p>

            <description>Banshee 0.10.7 is out, and already uploaded to Ubuntu Dapper Drake. (More on my Dapper Drake experiences this weekend, I promise!)
Finally, genre is an available column (yay!) despite Aaron’s protests. 0.10.7 also makes the full time switch to gstreamer 0.10.
I’ve been playing with it, and after one hiccup on Dapper Drake, it works flawlessly. Banshee is definitely my music player of chocie.</description>

            <description>It’s a long shot at best, but if the current collective bargaining agreement were to expire, and anti-trust rules go into place, EA could lose their exclusivity to the NFL players and teams come 2008.
Gamersreports has the story.
I’ve meant to post a gigantic rant for some time on EA exclusive license to the NFL, as it relates to Madden for a long time. I wish I had when it was still relevant, and who knows, I still might.</description>

            <description>If you’re an NFL fan, Len Pasquarelli of ESPN.com has a must read article on what they’re calling today: Bloody Thursday. His follow-up article on what will go down to today is just as good.
With the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Player’s Union and Owners set to expire tomorrow, teams must get under the salary cap – a cap number they still don’t know. Free Agency starts tomorrow, and 2007 will be an uncapped year, so teams will be reluctant to sign anyone, especially as they can only pro-rate contracts over 4 years instead of the typical 7, which drives a player’s salary cap number through the roof.</description>

<p>Will an 11th hour deal arrive and save the league? Are we a year away from no college draft? Will the owners lock the players out after next season?</p>
<p>In the next 36 hours, watch the drama unfold!</p>

            <description>As you should know by now, I’m a huge Ubuntu Linux fan. I’ve been using Linux off and on since 1997, starting with Red Hat, and have tried most distros in between (SUSE, Mandriva, Gentoo, Debian) but it was Ubuntu that made me switch permanently from Red Hat (and later, Fedora) when Ubuntu’s 4.10 was released.
I use Ubuntu on all three of my main machines now (except my Windows Media PC when I have to use Windows, and my Mac Mini, just to toy with Mac OS X), and made the switch to use Ubuntu full-time a year ago when I decided to give up my gaming habit.</description>

            <description>Lawrence Lessig on today’s history lesson:
 On February 8, 1996, Congress enacted the 1996 Telecom Act, which included the Communications Decency Act. After the President signed both laws, John Perry Barlow, at Davos, issued his âDeclaration of Independence of Cyberspace.â?
The Supreme Court struck the core of the CDA within 16 months. The Telecom Act is still being litigated, and Congress is now talking about trashing it.
But John Perryâs Declaration is still a great read.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/cat_read_this.shtml">Lawrence Lessig on today’s history lesson</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On February 8, 1996, Congress enacted the 1996 Telecom Act, which included the Communications Decency Act. After the President signed both laws, John Perry Barlow, at Davos, issued his â<a href="http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html">Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace</a>.â?</p>
<p>The Supreme Court struck the core of the CDA within 16 months. The Telecom Act is still being litigated, and Congress is now talking about trashing it.</p>
<p>But John Perryâs Declaration is still a great read.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Mr. Lessig is right. John Perry Barlow’s Declaration <em>is</em> still a good read. And, in my opinion, the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/telecom.html">1996 Telecom Act</a>completely failed what it was trying to accomplish. Ten years later, and we are seeing the re-forming of Ma Bell (Look at SBC – purchased two other regional phone companies in the last 5 years (Pacific Bell &amp; Ameritech) and last year’s purchase of what was left of AT&amp;T), these same phone companies complaining about web services like Google running over “thier pipes” and content providers should pay for the privilege (isn’t that why individual users pay a monthly fee for broadband?), and compared to the rest of the world, the U.S. has one of the worst broadband availability, and some of the highest prices.</p>
<p>It’s too bad too, because I belive the 1996 Telecom Act meant to do good things, and they just never happened.</p>

            <description>Go here and download the Best of Bootie 2005, a collection of mash-ups featuring the favorite mashups of 2005 bootiesf.com.
They picked some good ones – I really dig the album. But then again, I dig mashups. What’s a mashup? Think remix, especially when you combine one artists vocals with a completely different artists music. Look at the track listing on the link above – the last song on the album is actually really good, which is NWA vocal’s laid over Nirvana’s Smells like Teen Spirit.</description>

            <description>From the preview over at Planetquake4:
 Other features include in game voice chat, absolute Linux support (though may not be 100% done at the time of shipping), Punkbuster for anti-cheating, and stopwatch mode for tournament play.
 Sweet! Enemy Territory: Quake Wars will run on the Doom3 engine, and is being developed by Splash Damage, who did the original Enemy Territory. Quake Wars pits Strogg vs. Humans as the Strogg invades Earth, and will the two sides will have entirely different classes and vehicles.</description>

            <description>It’s here! I received the email yesterday to participate in the alpha test of Second Life’s Linux client. It’s Alpha – it has a few graphic glitches, but it’s working. It seems to run fast so far.
The client is very Mac OS-ish and very intuitive. Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to play as I needed to watch Jack with my better half out shopping, but I’m really looking forward to spending some time this weekend with Second Life.</description>

            <description>Linuxgames has the post and the links with the details.
Savage 1 was an interesting game – a RTS / FPS hybrid, that actually worked. The learning curve was a little steep, but it was a fun game.
I’m glad to see another major developer continue to support Linux – add S2 games to the list of developers doing the right thing like id and Epic.</description>

            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2006/01/iriver-h10-on-ubuntu-linux-howto/</link>

            <description>I’m pleased to announce that after looking into it off and on for the last 6 months, I’ve got my iRiver H10 5GB fully working in Linux for the first time.
The H10 comes in MTP mode – Microsoft Transfer Protocol, insead of being a UMS – USB Media Storage device. MTP is needed for Plays for Sure compatibility, so it will work with Napster-To-Go or Yahoo, for example. A UMS device, when plugged in, just shows up as a drive letter on your PC, so you can drag and drop files on to it.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m pleased to announce that after looking into it off and on for the last 6 months, I’ve got my iRiver H10 5GB fully working in Linux for the first time.</p>
<p>The H10 comes in MTP mode – Microsoft Transfer Protocol, insead of being a UMS – USB Media Storage device. MTP is needed for Plays for Sure compatibility, so it will work with Napster-To-Go or Yahoo, for example. A UMS device, when plugged in, just shows up as a drive letter on your PC, so you can drag and drop files on to it. Sacrificing Napster-to-go (which I haven’t used in 6 months) is a small price to pay to use this on Linux – especially as no modern online music store has a Linux client yet.</p>
<p>The steps needed update your firmware, convert your iRiver to UMS mode, and then you need to install EasyH10 to rebuild your music database. Do this at your own risk!</p>
<p>How I did it, and be prepared to lose any music on your H10:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I updated my firmware from 2.03 to 2.51 MTP, <a href="http://iriver.com/html/support/download/sudw_view.asp?searchProductIdx=&amp;searchCategoryIdx=&amp;searchString=&amp;page=1&amp;idx=739&amp;tmpSearchProductIdx=&amp;tmpSearchCategoryIdx=&amp;tmpSearchString=">version 2.51 at iRiver.com</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to the <a href="http://www.misticriver.net/wiki/index.php/H10">Misticriver.net H10 Wiki</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the <a href="http://www.misticriver.net/wiki/index.php/H10_Firmware_Conversion:_MTP/UMS">instructions to convert your H10 from MTP to UMS</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download EasyH10: <a href="http://easyh10.sourceforge.net/download.html">Windows or Linux tarball</a> or <a href="http://webb.ens-cachan.fr/debian/pool/main/e/easyh10/">Debian / Ubuntu package</a>. (I used the <a href="http://webb.ens-cachan.fr/debian/pool/main/e/easyh10/easyh10_1.2.1-1_i386.deb">i386 Debian package</a> on Ubuntu 5.10 with no problems).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If installing on Ubuntu or Debian, at a terminal, type:
<code>sudo dpkg -i easyh10_1.2.1-1_i386.deb</code><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plug in your H10 to your Ubuntu box. It should mount in /media/H10 (if it didn’t, for the purpose of this, I’m going to use that going forward).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a command line type:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>cd /usr/share/easyh10/model</code> (On Ubuntu, could be /usr/local/share/easyh10/model on other distributions) and then <code>ls</code></p>
<p>Find your model in the list, I have a H10UMS_5GB_FW2.04-2.51.model so we’ll use that in the next step.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a terminal, type in the following:
<code>cp /usr/share/easyh10/model/H10UMS_5GB_FW2.04-2.51.model /media/H10/easyh10.model</code> (Or whichever corresponding version you have, copy it over as easyh10.model in the root directory of the H10).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li>Unmount your H10 (right click and click unmount), unplug the USB cable, let it reboot and install, and then plug it back in to your PC.</li>
<li>Copy some music in to your H10/Media/Music directory. Not Music the directory!</li>
<li>From a terminal type <code>easyh10 -Un -on /media/H10</code> to rebuild your database.
That should be it! However, if you run in easyh10 and see this, like I did:</li>
</ul>
<p>`EasyH10 [CUI] 1.2.1  Copyright (c) 2005 by Nyaochi<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>    Per [this thread on the EasyH10 forums][7], delete all your files in the H10/System/DATA folder. Run it again, and you should see:
    
    `silwenae@shaftoe:/usr/share/easyh10/model$ easyh10 -Un -on /media/H10&lt;br /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>EasyH10 [CUI] 1.2.1  Copyright (c) 2005 by Nyaochi<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>    It&amp;#8217;s my understanding that after every time you add music files to your H10, you need to run EasyH10 to update your database to let your H10 know that the music is there. You could choose to play songs through the Browser on the H10, but it&amp;#8217;s easiest in Music.
    
    Unfortunately, the H10 isn&amp;#8217;t recognized in [Banshee][8], but with how the database needs to be updated each time, I doubt it will ever work. Though this is a great start for using in Linux, as this was the last thing that required me to have a Windows box.

            <description>One of my favorite discussions is with a friend of mine about the TV show, Lost. We each take our guesses of what’s going on or who is next to die, or throw out a theory of why they’re on the island. (His is related to The Tempest, mine is about redemption).
However, this site offers a new theory, and fairly well thought out. I know I would have never thought of it.</description>

            <description>Engadget builds a practical PVR. Coming in at just over $1000, with tuners, Engadget does a pretty good job of building a PVR for everyday use. The motherboard is a knockout, though I would have added more storage than just one 250 gig hard drive.
And of course, they’re using MythTV!.</description>

Of course she didn’t tell me some of that until a day or two later. Well, probably for the best that way.</description>

            <description>Today marks the one year anniversary of 89.3, The Current, a Minnesota Public Radio station.
By far the best radio station to hit the Twin Cities in a long time, The Current offers an eclectic playlist you’d be pressed to find anywhere else, other than KCRW or KEXP. With a focus on Minnesota local music, and DJ’s who get to play their own songs of their choosing, where else can you hear music from Elvis to Aimee Mann to Thunderbirds Are Now!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today marks the one year anniversary of <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/the_current/">89.3, The Current</a>, a Minnesota Public Radio station.</p>
<p>By far the best radio station to hit the Twin Cities in a long time, The Current offers an eclectic playlist you’d be pressed to find anywhere else, other than KCRW or KEXP. With a focus on Minnesota local music, and DJ’s who get to play their own songs of their choosing, where else can you hear music from Elvis to Aimee Mann to Thunderbirds Are Now!</p>
<p>Check out their <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/the_current/songs_played/">real time playlist</a> – it’s as diverse as it comes. You can even <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/the_current/streams.php">listen online</a> if you choose.</p>
<p>I’ve volunteered for a couple different things for 89.3, and the first event I went to was a volunteer meet &amp; greet. Towards the end of the session, and their current Vice President at the time summed it up best. I don’t remember the exact quote, but it went something like this: “We want The Current to be the radio station that helps connect music for our listeners, so they hear the evolution of music through the years, from Muddy Waters to G. Love.” Not only do they play artists you don’t hear on mainstream radio, but they introduce new artists like the Hold Steady, and help connect the dots and teach you about music.</p>
<p>The Minneapolis Star-Tribune <a href="http://www.startribune.com/457/story/193724.html">ran an article this past Sunday</a> on the front page of the Lifestyle section about The Current. The article was only about 50% good – they took a number of shots at The Current in the back half of the article, but it gives you a good overview of the last year for 89.3.</p>
<p>Here’s to many more years listening to a great radio station!</p>

            <description>As I mentioned in my last post, I needed to use different modeline setting on my Nvidia xorg.conf file than when I had my ATI card installed.
I have no idea why, but it worked. For posterity’s sake, I thought I’d just document ’em here in case I ever needed again.
For my Nvidia card, in the Monitor section of my xorg.conf:

<p><code>Section &quot;Monitor&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Identifier  &quot;Monitor0&quot;&lt;br /&gt; HorizSync   30-82&lt;br /&gt; VertRefresh 60-60&lt;br /&gt; Option &quot;DPMS&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Modeline &quot;1920x1200&quot; 193.16 1920 2048 2256 2592 1200 1201 1204 1242 -Hsync +Vsync</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>EndSection</p>
<p>They both worked for 1920×1200, the monitor’s native resolution, flawlessly. There’s a big difference in going from 1920×1200 to any other resolution, especially 1600×1200 or below. This monitor is definitely most crisp and bright when running in 1920×1200 like it should be.</p>

            <description>I thought I was done with installing my operating system, but I ran into another glitch today. I installed, or more appropriately, tried to install Quake IV and Doom 3. Quake IV I had working previously before the reformat, and I kept meaning to get around to installing Doom 3 on Linux to try out some of the mods.

I installed, or more appropriately, tried to install Quake IV and Doom 3. Quake IV I had working previously before the reformat, and I kept meaning to get around to installing Doom 3 on Linux to try out some of the mods.</p>
<p>Fixing my Doom 3 problem was easy – for whatever reason, my DVD-rom drive wouldn’t read the first disc, so I couldn’t transfer the .pak file over I needed. Put it on the NAS, and fixed it.</p>
<p>Quake IV is driving me nuts. All of the menu’s have the wrong text, such as #str_000000 or different numbers. Searching on Google turned up <a href="http://lists.suse.com/archive/suse-linux-e/2005-Dec/2171.html">one hit on the SUSE mailing lists</a> – and the guy reinstalled and it was fine. I’ve re-installed 3 times with no luck, including trying the 1.05 installer instead of 1.06.</p>
<p>I even thought the above problems were a video card driver problem, that my ATI card wasn’t working right. So I swapped it out for a Nvidia 6800 and spent a good hour reconfiguring my X server (that was fun). Turns out I needed different mode lines for my Dell 2405 (more on that later).</p>
<p>The net result is I’m running a Nvidia 6800 instead of my ATI x800, so the net result is about equal. It took a while to get my 1920×1200 resolution back, but it’s working. Doom3 is working, but no Quake IV yet (and I even backed up my save games!).</p>

            <description>I am the OS Installation Master. I must have installed or booted LiveCDs of Ubuntu at least 10 times today.
When I re-installed 5.10 last week, I got a weird error on my first bootup that no OS wasn’t found. I re-installed, and deleted all the partitions on both hard drives, and no problems.
Well, similar situation after installing Edubuntu and Dapper Drake Flight 3. Same error. After installing and reinstalling OS’s to no avail, including wiping the main hard drive, and spending a couple hours tweaking GRUB by hand, it turns out that the boot order in my BIOS was out of order, looking at the 2nd hard drive first, instead of the 1st hard drive.</description>

I have no idea how the BIOS was changed (sure wasn’t by me!), as the MBR is on the first hard drive. Changed the BIOS option, and booting in to (a fresh version) of Ubuntu. Now the test will be installing Edubuntu again on the 2nd hard drive.</p>
<p>But I can say I have installing Ubuntu down cold. The bad news is, was that I installed Quake IV and Doom 3 this morning, patched ’em, and downloaded a few mods. It was time consuming, but not that big a loss. The good news is was that re-installing wasn’t that big of a deal, as I had everything backed up from my fresh install last week.</p>

            <description>I’m up and running on a clean install of Ubuntu 5.10. Everything went smooth, swapped the hard drives out, re-installed from scratch, wiping my hard drives clean.
One of the cooler things I found during the re-install, was Automatix and Easy Ubuntu. Both are illegal in the United States, specifically for the codec support they install (DVD, MP3, etc).
Basically, they do the same thing, though Automatix is more complete. They provide a script to install everything a default Ubuntu installation didn’t – support for MP3, DVD, plugins like Flash and Java for Firefox, missing applications like dvd::rip, windows codecs, multimedia players such as mplayer, etc.</description>

Automatix lets you pick and choose, and then just installs the stuff. Very cool that the user community have started these projects.</p>
<p>I’m going to wait on installing Dapper Drake Flight 3 on the second hard drive. Instead, I downloaded <a href="http://www.edubuntu.org/">Edubuntu</a>, and am going to install that first. With three kids under the age of 10, I’ve always wanted to start them on Linux. My 10 year old son no longer really plays games – he plays a ton of flash games on the net from Lego, Yahooligans, etc. Edubuntu may be a great alternative, but I will need to find a new wireless card. So we’ll install that and take a look-see.</p>

            <description>My favorite FTP client for Windows, Filezilla, is being ported to Linux for the release of Filezilla 3. Linuxedge has a preview of Filezilla 3 on Linux built from CVS.
Pretty cool, I’ve been a big fan of Filezilla for years, though gFTP seems to work fine for me on my Linux desktop. It looks GNOME-HIG compliant, and will be interesting to test out.</description>

            <description>As I mentioned in my last post, screwing around with my Ubuntu repositories has messed some stuff up on my system. Most of my Mono apps no longer work, with the exception of Tomboy.
This past Sunday, I was modding another Xbox, and unzipping ROM files like a madman, when I ran out of disk space. 60 gigs goes fast, especially with all the music and photos on this machine, as well as a few games.</description>

<p>This past Sunday, I was modding another Xbox, and unzipping ROM files like a madman, when I ran out of disk space. 60 gigs goes fast, especially with all the music and photos on this machine, as well as a few games.</p>
<p>I have a 20 gig installed as a secondary drive, where I keep a development version of Ubuntu running. I haven’t booted in to that drive a while.</p>
<p>One of my New Year’s resolutions is to contribute something to Ubuntu this year. Whether it’s writing documentation, bug hunting, or on the wiki, I need to do something. (God knows I can’t right code). More on that in another post.</p>
<p>How do these all tie together? Today I began the process of backing up my stuff on this machine, and I’m going to swap out hard drives and reinstall. I debated about just throwing in an extra hard drive replacing the 20 gig to fix my space problem and mounting that, but I discarded that option. I’m going to get a 120 gig drive as my main hard drive to run Ubuntu 5.10 as my stable operating system, and make the 60 gig drive run the latest development version of Ubuntu, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperFlight3">Dapper Drake</a>.</p>
<p>So tonight I’ll swap out my CDRW for a DVDRW, remove and add a hard drive, and re-install Ubuntu a couple of times.</p>
<p>Fun!</p>

            <description>I wanted to upgrade the to the latest Banshee music player something fierce. I’ve been meaning to blog about Banshee for forever and a day, but with the latest tarball out, that includes plugin support, especially Audioscrobbler, I tried to upgrade.
Well, Banshee wants the latest and greatest Mono. I checked the Ubuntu Backports, but they didn’t have the latest Banshee nor Mono.
So I tried something that worked when I was running Ubuntu 5.</description>

<p>Mono seems to be working fine, and the Mono apps I have loaded (Tomboy, F-Spot) with one exception – Banshee. Banshee segfaults if you just look at it funny. I can’t listen to music, import my library, or restart it after a crash.</p>
<p>Ah well, back to XMMS for listening to music.</p>

            <description>I’d like a Nokia 770 please.
The era of handheld, internet browsing tablets is finally here. With an impressive 800×440 resolution, running a customized version of GNOME, this would be perfect for me. I currently keep a laptop in the living room, but rarely use it – and when I do, it’s to browse the net while watching TV, and that’s about it. This is truly what I need. Well, not need, but want.</description>

Only 22 episodes to go!</description>

            <description>I’m not sure why, but I was happy to see the Steelers win this afternoon.
The Colts have a coach who is well respected, with a rep he can’t win the big one, but who is supposed to be one of the nicest coaches you’ll ever meet. They have one of the best, if not the best, quarterback in the league. And yet I was rooting against them.
There’s something about Bill Cowher that makes me cheer for the man.</description>

<p>There’s something about Bill Cowher that makes me cheer for the man. He’s a pull no punches, tell like it is coach. I like the trick plays. I like the blue collar feel to the Steelers. I like that Cowher just wins – and his tenure in the league is as impressive as anything.</p>
<p>Jerome Bettis is pure class as he has accepted his role, and Big Ben, while tip-toeing the line of cockiness, is a hell of a leader on the feel. Troy Palamalu just makes plays – and he was robbed today.</p>
<p>Robbed! I don’t know what it was, but I thought the refs in both of today’s games were just off. From the non-call false start / off-sides in the Colt / Steelers game to the overturn of Palamalu’s interception, there were even a couple calls in the Bears / Panthers games that just seemed wrong.</p>
<p>Poor refs can’t ever catch a break.</p>
<p>I was sad to see the Patriots lose, but happy to see the Bears and Redskins lose. (Yes, I’m more happy for teams to lose than teams to win). The Bears is an easy call – I’m a Packer fan, and the true rivalry is with the team in Chicago. For the Seahawks – meh. I’m happy for them as it’s been 21 years since their last playoff win, and I respect Coach Holmgren – even if he is coaching the wrong team.</p>
<p>Next week’s picks: Steelers and Panthers win, and meet in Super Bowl XL.</p>

 Your stock answer below does not answer either of my questions.
Let me be clear as to what my questions are:
 Why did GoDaddy park my domain for a period of 6-12 hours on 1/9/2006?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’s just say that I received such a form letter in response to my email, that I won’t even post it. Basically they implied it was a problem with my webhost since I don’t host with GoDaddy. It led me to firing back this, short and sweet:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Now they need to verify it’s me speaking to them, and the cycle continues.</p>

            <description>The Register asks the questions about Google’s new DRM that need to be asked.
Just because it’s Google, doesn’t mean they deserve a free pass. DRM is DRM. And now we have multiple, confusing, versions of DRM to muck up our content.
As the article says, so much for your motto, Do No Evil, Google.
If you still need to get up to speed on why DRM just plain won’t work, Read Cory Doctorow’s June 2004 speech on DRM to Microsoft or in pretty html here.</description>

            <description>I have multiple websites through Dotster and GoDaddy, and typically register with whomever is cheapest, and then jump to a different registrar at renewal time to again keep costs down. I’ve been happy with GoDaddy’s renewal fees, as the registrars usually try to charge you double to renew vs. registering a domain, and GoDaddy usually charges the same price.
However, with paulcutler.org up for renewal, they’ve screwed the pooch pretty bad on this one.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have multiple websites through <a href="http://www.dotster.com">Dotster</a> and <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a>, and typically register with whomever is cheapest, and then jump to a different registrar at renewal time to again keep costs down.

<p>However, with paulcutler.org up for renewal, they’ve screwed the pooch pretty bad on this one. A copy of my (fairly nice) email is below, we’ll wait for their response. According to their <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/support.asp?se=%20&amp;ci=412">support website</a> their phone hold time is 17 minutes, and average email response time is 9 hours. As it’s not mission critical as the site is up now, we’ll see how their email response is.</p>
<p>Here’s my email / letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear GoDaddy Customer Service Representative:</p>
<p>I wanted to make you aware of a problem I had with your service. I visited my domain early this morning (7 a.m. CST) and I received a GoDaddy Parked Domain page. Logging in to my account at GoDaddy, it showed my domain expiring on 1-4-2006.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my office network blocks webmail, so I was unable to visit Gmail to double check my last email from GoDaddy. I then assume assumed the domain had expired as the GoDaddy account page showed, and GoDaddy had given me a week before parking the domain, as it had worked last night. I then renewed the domain for another 2 years through GoDaddy early this morning.</p>
<p>Upon returning home tonight from work, my domain was working again, and I checked my GoDaddy account and Gmail. Sure enough, I have a receipt from GoDaddy in Gmail showing I renewed this domain on 12-8-2005 for 2 years, and my GoDaddy account now showed my domain was now renewed through 2010.</p>
<p>Please explain to me why my domain was parked when I renewed over a month ago. I feel taken now that I’ve renewed for an additional 2 years on top of my renewal in December and you have even more of my money. I’m extremely disappointed in your level of service, specifically in not displaying my account information correctly.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Paul Cutler</p>

            <description>Gov. Jim Doyle of Wisconsin signed into law a bill requiring any vendor who provides electronic voting machines must provide the code that runs on those machines.
This, combined with paper copies of the vote you cast for (which Wisconsin also requires) are a must when it comes to electronic voting. Not just to avoid the fraud as seen in Ohio in 2004, or as a check against corrupt CEOs who publicly say they’ll do everything in their power to see an election go a certain way and they also just happen to provide e-voting machines, but the code and paper voting provide trust to the end user that their vote counts.</description>

            <description>ESPN has had a banner running for the last few weeks promoting the halftime shows of the BCS College Bowls for their musical acts. One of them has been Queen + Paul Rodgers.
I am huge Queen fan, and really got into them again in 90/91 when they were re-releasing their albums on CD. I had almost completed my collection when Freddie Mercury died in 1991. I’ve had mixed feelings on this whole tour with Paul Rodgers not understanding why Queen would be touring again without their frontman, the legendary Freddie Mercury.</description>

<p>I am huge Queen fan, and really got into them again in 90/91 when they were re-releasing their albums on CD. I had almost completed my collection when Freddie Mercury died in 1991. I’ve had mixed feelings on this whole tour with Paul Rodgers not understanding why Queen would be touring again without their frontman, the legendary Freddie Mercury.</p>
<p>Who was this <a href="http://www.paulrodgers.com/bio.htm">Paul Rodgers</a> guy? Why was he touring with Queen, and why would Brian May and Co. resurrect Queen with a new lead singer?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out Paul Rodgers was the founder and lead singer for Free, Bad Company, and the Firm. He has an impressive <a href="http://www.paulrodgers.com/bio.htm">resume</a>. Now knowing his background, I can respect Queen’s decision to tour with him.</p>
<p>Browsing around <a href="http://www.queenonline.com/index2.php?section=4&amp;feature=16">Queen’s website</a>, I came across their store where they offer their <a href="http://www.7digital.com/shops/assets/queen/bootlegs.asp">Official Bootlegs</a>. While the collection is still growing, the price is amazing for what you get. For about $9 after translating the currency, you can buy live bootleg albums with up to 30 songs. Encoded in 192k WMA (192k = good, WMA = bad), the price is phenomenal for what you get. I’ll definitely be picking up a few of those in the days to come.</p>

            <description>I love this time of the year – I think I’ve watched a football game every day for the last 10 days. Even the first few bowl games with teams you’ve rarely heard of we’re quite good (and I’m still laughing at George O’Leary).
I was ecstatic to see the Badgers win decisively in Coach Alvarez’s last game. I had been walking around the last few days convinced that what the analysts said was true – Auburn’s defense was going to rip in to Wisconsin, and the Badgers had little chance to win.</description>

I had been walking around the last few days convinced that what the analysts said was true – Auburn’s defense was going to rip in to Wisconsin, and the Badgers had little chance to win. Was I wrong – the Badgers won, and won big. Forget about the 10.5 point underdog status – Auburn couldn’t get it together all day and the Badgers offense was hot in the first half, and the defense played a heck of a game.</p>
<p>I was shocked to see the Packers fire Mike Sherman today – it wasn’t the $6 million they owe him for the last two years of his contract, it’s the question of who will replace him. In a year where there will be more head coaching vacancies than normal, will there be enough talent to go around? I also question if Ted Thompson is doing it for the right reasons – is Sherman definitely the wrong guy, or is Thompson trying to put his stamp on the team.</p>
<p>Time will tell. This leads me to believe Favre will retire, and is will be interesting to watch the Packers enter the next generation.</p>

            <description>I’ve upgraded the ole blog to WordPress 2.0 and the K2 theme to the latest, revision 151.
Overall, I’m pretty impressed. Visually, it’s much better, though the post editor is now a more WYSIWYG type, and there seem to be some kinks to be worked out with that, but I’m guessing it may have to do with a Firefox extension I’m using. The plugins I use (FlickrRSS, Ultimate Tag Warrior) seem to work, and I’ve switched from Spam Karma 2 to Akismet for spam blockage.</description>

            <description>Kelly got me one of the best gifts I’ve got in a long time, The Complete Calvin and Hobbes Collection.
Weighing at just over 22 pounds, the collection consists of 3 hardcover bound books, with every comic done by Bill Watterson. Kicking off with a 14 page foreword, which was worth it a lone, as Mr. Watterson discusses his love of comics, and touches on why he never granted interviews or went ahead with merchandising.</description>

<p>Each book contains 3 years worth of strips, interspersed with water color paintings that take up a whole page. The comic strips are laid out in order, and the background color of each page is an off-white that really makes the strips stand out. Each page has the dates the comics on the page were originally run.</p>
<p>I love Calvin and Hobbes – not only does it take me back to my childhood, but those strips still make me laugh out loud as I was reading them this weekend. It truely is one of the timeless classics.</p>

            <description>The Gstreamer team at Fluendohas licensed the MP3 codec for use on Linux! From the article:
 Why are we doing this ? Quite simple. mp3 is a very widespread format, and the fact that Linux could not legally play it out of the box in countries where patents apply is posing a lot of problems for adoption. It is one of the most commonly heard complaints about distros these days.</description>

It is one of the most commonly heard complaints about distros these days. Fluendo still fully supports open formats, and we hope people move to using them. Part of that move is being able to play your legacy formats, where you have no choice over the format. Remember, we are not giving away a free encoder.</p>

<p>What does this mean? That one of the biggest oversights in all Linux distributions has been fixed – Distro’s can bundle in MP3 decoding support out of the box, and not have to worry about patent issues.</p>

Sen. Feingold has Senators listening! With a vote of 52-47, 8 short to override a filibuster, Senators today rejected extending the Patriot Act. Senators from all sides joined Sen. Feingold in opposing this terrible piece of legislation that stomps on American’s civil liberties.

<blockquote>
<p>“We can come together to give the government the tools it needs to fight terrorism and protect the rights and freedoms of innocent citizens,” said Sen.

            <description>Flaming Sheep Software has released the Classic Doom mod for Doom3. Bringing back the look, feel and maps of the original Doom now running on the Doom3 engine.
Quake IV on Linux has been a breeze to run, I’m going to have to install my Doom3 copy that’s around here somewhere and try this mod out.</description>

            <description>The first Ubuntu Desktop News has been published.
It contains an overview of all the work being done on the upcoming 6.04 Dapper Drake release of Ubuntu, specifically around desktop improvements.
With lots of topics, including speed improvements, being able to install packages by just double-clicking on a .deb file (!), Rhythmbox mention, and an interview with Sebastian Bacher, if you’re an Ubuntu user, this is worth a read!</description>

            <description>Back in July, I blogged about Icculus starting a port of Second Life.
About a month ago, I signed up for a Second Life account as it was: a) free and b) you need an account to get on the Second Life forums. I was looking for an answer or update on the Linux port. I didn’t find anything, but I headed back today, and found this post by Andrew Linden on the Linden staff:</description>

He wanted to work on it in his copius spare time and LL’s stance was, “If you can do it, great!”. He made some rapid progress, then got sidetracked and never got back to it. I prodded him twice but he didn’t reply.</p>
<p>Which is very unfortunate. I don’t even have access to SL at home anymore since our Windows computer finally succumbed to a virus. I transferred all of the important data over to a Knoppix/debian machine and haven’t had time to rebuild a fresh Windows installation.</p>
<p>I would love to work on a GNU/Linux port of SL but I already have a full plate of stuff to do that I can’t get done fast enough. 🙁</p>

<p>Very interesting. Nice to have an update, and I’m intrigued that Icculus started the port on his own. I’m curious if he had the source from Linden Labs, or used the Mac client to port it to Linux. I’m disappointed that it never got finished, but I more than understand getting sidetracked when you were working on it for free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.icculus.org">Icculus.org</a> is down (just today) switching ISPs, and I think Icculus has a FAQ up about contacting him – and this is one of those topics that are probably taboo. Bummer.</p>

Within 10 days, Green Day’s label, Warner Music, sent Dean Gray a takedown notice. Today, Tues. Dec. 13th, is American Edit day, when websites all over the globe host the MP3’s for download. Not for commercial gain, but to share and enjoy Green Day’s music, dubbed with other music, to promote Green Day.</description>

            <description>Driving in a car for just over 10 hours over a 24 hour period, to watch a 3.5 hour game was worth it – the Packers actually won a game this season.
While cold, it wasn’t nearly as bad as the game 3 years ago, and I only bought one hot chocolate this time.
Definitely worth it.</description>

            <description>How do you stop a film that exposes how the film industry assigns a rating (G, PG, PG-13, R) to a film?
Rate the film NC-17. Rating a film NC-17 stops the movie from being advertised, limits which theaters will even show it, and effectively censors the message.
The Independent Film Channel (IFC) has stepped up and will show it uncut in Fall 2006, after the film’s debut at Sundance this January.</description>

However, with that said, here is a fascinating story about the power of public relations firms.

<p>However, with that said, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html">here is a fascinating story about the power of public relations firms</a>.</p>
<p>As someone who has used PR as a tactic, the article is pretty damn close to the truth. This paragraphy in particular struck me, and I thought the author’s conclusions about PR and the blogosphere are right on. I’ll leave you with the quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn’t realize, till there was an alternative, just how artificial most of the writing in the mainstream media was. I’m not saying I used to believe what I read in Time and Newsweek. Since high school, at least, I’ve thought of magazines like that more as guides to what ordinary people were being told to think than as sources of information. But I didn’t realize till the last few years that writing for publication didn’t have to mean writing that way. I didn’t realize you could write as candidly and informally as you would if you were writing to a friend.</p>

<p>Secret laws requiring identification for interstate travel, wiretaps without judicial review, secret reviews of what books you check out from a library or you buy, and other invasions of privacy are about to be extended for another four years.</p>
<p>Talk to your representatives in Congress, and let them know it’s wrong.</p>

            <description>As a (spoiled) multi-computer user, one of my small annoyances is keeping tracks of my bookmarks on different machines. I’ve tried the Firefox extension that syncs bookmarks via FTP with mixed success, and a while back I signed up for a Del.icio.us but didn’t make great use of it.
Well, now Del.icio.us built a Firefox extension that makes it a cinch to keep track of all your bookmarks via their service.</description>

<p>I’m adding bookmarks like crazy, and may just wait for the import service to kick back in as it seems to be down. I highly recommend del.icio.us.</p>

            <description>I’m back from my weekend of fun, if you were wondering where the blog updates were.
We had a mini get together, as we tried to keep the group (and more imporantly, the LAN party) manageable, especially as it’s the holiday time of year.
A few folks flew up from Texas, a few drove over the border from Wisconsin, and the core MN group got together. Friday night we hit Sportspage, with the best wings in Minnesota.</description>

<p>A few folks flew up from Texas, a few drove over the border from Wisconsin, and the core MN group got together. Friday night we hit Sportspage, with the best wings in Minnesota. The owner of the bar let us hook up a Xbox 360 on one of the plasmas, while the other plasma had the Gopher – Badger hockey game going. (Good job this weekend Badgers!)</p>
<p>Saturday saw a very relaxed LAN party, with Quake IV, UT2k4 (Bombing Run &amp; CTF) and CS:S all played. And we wrapped up with some poker.</p>
<p>A good time was had by most… let’s say all but one, and he knows who he is. 😉</p>

            <description>Michael Robertson has done it again. Mr. Robertson founded MP3.com in the mid-90’s before selling it, and went on to found Linspire (I’ll give him credit for owning a Linux distribution, especially one built off Debian, but still…) as well as a VoIP company, and now he’s back in the music business with MP3tunes.com. He was in the news a few weeks ago for hiring DVD Jon, aka Jon Lech Johansen, who cracked the DVD encryption a few years back, as well as iTunes DRM.</description>

Mr. Robertson founded MP3.com in the mid-90’s before selling it, and went on to found Linspire (I’ll give him credit for owning a Linux distribution, especially one built off Debian, but still…) as well as a VoIP company, and now he’s back in the music business with <a href="http://www.mp3tunes.com">MP3tunes.com</a>. He was in the news a few weeks ago for hiring DVD Jon, aka Jon Lech Johansen, who cracked the DVD encryption a few years back, as well as iTunes DRM.</p>
<p>What is MP3tunes.com? From their <a href="http://www.test.mp3tunes.com/cb/help/">FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the MP3tunes Locker?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A: The MP3tunes Locker gives you unlimited online storage to back-up your entire personal music collection, including your playlists. You can sync your music collection in your MP3tunes Locker with your computers, portable players and devices. You’re able to webload free tracks you find on the Internet directly into your MP3tunes Locker or sideload with one of our partners. You can play your music collection and playlists in iTunes and anywhere you have an Internet connection. The MP3tunes Oboe Software Suite is free and includes Oboe Sync, Oboe for iTunes and Oboe for Firefox.</p>
<p>The Basic MP3tunes Locker includes webloading, sideloading, MP3tunes Oboe Software Suite, and streaming inside iTunes on the Internet at a medium quality bit-rate (56k).</p>
<p>The Premium MP3tunes Locker is $39.95 per year and includes back-up with unlimited storage, syncing, webloading, sideloading, MP3tunes Oboe Software Suite, and streaming inside iTunes on the Internet at a high quality bit-rate (128k).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you remember when MP3.com got hosed by the RIAA? Basically, they had an idea that you inserted a music CD in to your PC. Their website said, hey look – you own that CD, thanks for verifying it. Now we’ll stream it to you wherever you are! Well, the RIAA went through the roof, and they took that feature out.</p>
<p>It looks like Mr. Robertson has brought that idea back, but in a much, much bigger way. This time you’re the one uploading your music – and while it may take forever to upload a large collection, you’ve proven that you’ve sent over your files. And now, you can “sideload” – buy music from another provider and have it synced.</p>
<p>Check the site out, and read the FAQ. While some of it will require using their syncing software to get the heavy lifting done, I do give MP3tunes.com credit for having Windows, Mac and Linux clients, multiple music format support, such as MP3, OGG and WMA, as well as a plugin for iTunes and Firefox ready to go at launch.</p>
<p>I’ll definitely be keeping an eye on this.</p>

(Elway finished with 94 yards rushing.) According to Sports Illustrated, Brister motivated his teammates in the huddle by saying, “All right, [expletive], I’m not John, so get your asses in gear.”</p>

            <description>I don’t think of myself as a neophyte when it comes to Linux or Ubuntu, but the All About Linux Blog covers 10 things that make Ubuntu great for a new Linux user.
I won’t cover them here, as he does a great job of explaining them. And I whole-heartedly agree – Ubuntu is the only distribution I would recommend for someone new to Linux. Or even to a user who’s used Linux for a while.</description>

            <description>Thanks to gout to FreeCulture.org’s RIAA-free CDs Holiday Gift Guide. FreeCulture.Org has put together a list of bands whose labels are not members of the RIAA. (You know – the group that sues 13 year old kids for things they didn’t do, and when they can’t pay up, blackmails them).
Suprisingly, there’s some really good bands on the lists. A few notable selections:
 Dan’s List: Interpol, New Pornagraphers, The Go!</description>

            <description>I don’t know if I should laugh or cry at this article on Gamasutra. Recapping a talk given at the Montreal International Game Summit last month, Rich Vogel, VP of Product Development at Sony Online Entertainment spoke about marketing directly to players in game, and managing their community outside of the game.
The fact that the industry is now talking about marketing to players within a game makes me want to cry – especially as almost all MMO games are roleplaying.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know if I should laugh or cry at <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20051125/duffy_01.shtml">this article on Gamasutra</a>. Recapping a talk given at the Montreal International Game Summit last month, Rich Vogel, VP of Product Development at Sony Online Entertainment spoke about marketing directly to players in game, and managing their community outside of the game.</p>
<p>The fact that the industry is now talking about marketing to players within a game makes me want to cry – especially as almost all MMO games are roleplaying. Marketing and advertising take you out of that context. Whether it’s fantasy like World of Warcraft or Everquest (1 or 2), or sci-fi like Eve Online, Anarchy Online or Star Wars Galaxies, market to the players outside of the game – on their forums, fan sites and other gaming websites. Leave it out of the game.</p>
<p>He does have some really good points on managing a MMOG community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vogel insisted that separate game-related web sites be run by developers, not marketing or PR personnel, and that the writers try to keep their style very human and accessible, joking now and again, and seeming informal and down to earth. Another piece of small advice that added to the sum: color code the writers of forums to their status, be they player, moderator, or developer. That way, readers of the forum can easily scan the boards for pertinent information from appropriate people. âYou need to have clear lines of responsibility,â? he says, noting that a clearly color-coded community manager on a forum doesn’t have the same powers that a dev has.</p>
<p>Vogel says MMOG owners do well to admit their mistakes. âWin over your community so that they are forgiving of you when you really screw up,â? he said. He also gave some advice about distracting the players when making a change to the game, not answering controversies that arise, as it just feeds them, and not taking too seriously the forum rants of hardcore players, who don’t represent the silent majority. You can get feedback from the quieter majority, however, by simply administering surveys. However, the hardcore, verbal players are the people who generate word of mouth marketing, Vogel admits, âso keep them happy, too.â?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I don’t know if I agree with the distraction comment above, but I do agree in not catering to the vocal minority. It’s interesting to see where Sony Online Entertainment may be going with their games.</p>

            <description>I haven’t done an Evil Corporations story in over two years, and it’s definitely time. The focus: Macrovision.
From their About Us page on their website:
 Macrovision helps solve the global need for content protection, DRM and software licensing solutions.
 Now we all know that I’m no fan of DRM or Digital Rights Management, and right there in their company description Macrovision makes it a point to let you knwo that’s exactly what they’re about.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven’t done an Evil Corporations story in over two years, and it’s definitely time. The focus: Macrovision.</p>

<p>Now we all know that I’m no fan of <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/index.php?s=DRM">DRM</a> or Digital Rights Management, and right there in their company description Macrovision makes it a point to let you knwo that’s exactly what they’re about.</p>
<p>Macrovision’s claim to fame was protecting VHS tapes in the 80s – did you ever try and copy a videotape from a rental store, and got those rainbow lines at the top and bottom? That’s them.</p>
<p>Even though it’s legal for you, as a consumer in the United States, to make one copy for backup and archival purposes, they make sure you can’t.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cdfreaks.com/news/12735">latest story</a> hitting the web today, is a <a href="http://www.cdfreaks.com/news/11914">follow-up to one from June.</a> In June, Macrovision sent a cease and desist letter to Lightning UK!, makers of DVD Decrypter. DVD Decrypter lets you strip the DRM off a DVD so you can archive to a hard drive or make a physical copy. Macrovision claimed the ability to strip the DRM violated their patents.</p>
<p>Well, the latest story has Macrovision claiming they’ve bought out Lightning UK!, and sending takedown notices to websites hosting DVD Decrypter. I’m sure they paid off the original developer thinking if you can’t beat ’em, buy ’em (ala Microsoft).</p>
<p>This is unfortunate for two reasons – one, reverse engineering should not be illegal, and in the U.S., under the DMCA, it now is. Two, if the developer had released this under a free software licenses, such as the GPL, the code would be in the wild. Now, due the evil greed of one corporation, we’re going to lose the ability to back up our DVDs. I know, as the father of 2 (almost three!) children, that I want to back up the movies they watch a lot and put them on a home theater PC. No more scratching and wrecking movies – which has happened with a few already.</p>
<p>But no, I’m no longer allowed to. And that’s why Macrovision is being added to my list of evil corporations.</p>

<p>Alias executive producer Jeff Pinkner said in a statement that the crew was “very saddened to face reality that Alias is coming to an end.” He promised a “surprising” and “thrilling” finale.</p>

<p>The worst part of that article? One little blurb at the bottom that reports CBS has pulled the plug on Threshold as well. I was really into Threshold in it’s inaugural season. Poor Carla Gugino, Karen Sisco on ABC didn’t work out, and now this.</p>

            <description>I had an opportunity to go my first Minnesota Wild game last night. I can’t believe it’s been 5 years already since the NHL came back to Minnesota, and I hadn’t even been to a game yet.
The seats were fan seats – the gentleman who picked them out before the Wild’s inaugural season put a lot of thought in to them. The 2 seats are on an aisle, 13 rows up behind the visiting goal, so 2 out of 3 periods, if the Wild are going to score, you’re going to see it.</description>

<p>The seats were fan seats – the gentleman who picked them out before the Wild’s inaugural season put a lot of thought in to them. The 2 seats are on an aisle, 13 rows up behind the visiting goal, so 2 out of 3 periods, if the Wild are going to score, you’re going to see it. Sitting behind the goal gives you a unique opportunity to watch the plays unfold, as you see the wingers fan wide setting up plays, and fast breaks coming straight at you are something to see.</p>
<p>It was a great time – hockey live is 10x better than on TV.</p>
<p>The Wild ended up losing – Roloson was in goal, and had 2 goals against in the first period, and the Wild seemed to play from behind the rest of the night. Gaborik made his return, and had a goal in the first period. The Wild ended up losing with 50 seconds left in the game to a little dunk shot that went between Rolosons legs.</p>
<p>Good game, great tempo to the game, good fans, and a great time.</p>

            <description>MP3Nova.org has the recap (and the torrent!) of a Radiohead Mash-up and Remix album.
Panzah Zandahz has released “Me &amp;amp; This Army”, the follow-up to “Breaks &amp;amp; Beats 12″”.
If you’re a Radiohead fan, check “Me &amp;amp; This Army” out – remixes and covers by folks like De La Soul, Jungle Brothers, and others, it looks like a must for any Radiohead fan. The torrent downloaded in just minutes for me, so head over to MP3Nova.</description>

            <description>I don’t blog politics much, though I’m a pretty passionate liberal (no, really).
DailyKos, one of the more liberal and bigger blogs out there, shared their November straw poll results for the Democratic primary.
Surprisingly enough, Russ Feingold is 2nd in the straw poll for the 3rd month in a row, after Gen. Clark.
Now granted, DailyKos readers are extremely progressive, but I’m still surprised. I had the honor of meeting Senator Feingold one Sunday when we bumped into each other at lunch at Dotty Dumplings Dowry (alas, one of the best burger places ever is gone from Madison now) when he was still a state senator.</description>

I’ve followed his career avidly (being from Wisconsin myself), and have great respect for him. Not only is he a maverick, but he votes his conscience. That, combined with how he listens to his voters – every year he visits every Wisconsin county and has a townhall in each one, Sen. Feingold is someone in the party I have great respect for.</p>

            <description>LinuxDevCenter.com: Installing and Configuring Ubuntu on a Laptop. Jeremy Jones of the Weather Channel purchases a Dell, and installs Ubuntu on it.
It’s a pretty good overview, and he runs into a couple quirky things that installing Linux on a laptop always seem to have, but no more than desktop installations now. Linux installs on laptops have come a long way in the last two years or so. While I had a similar experience with HP dv1000, it always comes down to the little things.</description>

            <description>One of the latest trends in open-source development, is for the projects website to be created with MediaWiki.
This article on Acts of Volition lists a couple others, as well as one of my current favorite pieces of software, Banshee, a music management and player for GNOME. (I’ve been meaning to blog about Banshee for well over a month).

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the latest trends in open-source development, is for the projects website to be created with <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://actsofvolition.com/archives/2005/september/wikiaswebsite">This article</a> on Acts of Volition lists a couple others, as well as one of my current favorite pieces of software, <a href="http://www.banshee-project.org/Main_Page">Banshee</a>, a music management and player for GNOME. (I’ve been meaning to blog about Banshee for well over a month).</p>
<p>I still have to put a long term plan together on integrating silwenae .com/.net/.org, and MediaWiki might address it. I don’t need all of the power of a Drupal, WordPress is already running my blog, Jinzora will power my music, and Flickr does my photos. I just need something sticky enough to link it all together.</p>
<p>I went and installed MediaWiki on the <a href="http://www.apatheia.org">Apatheia.org website</a> to see if the guild had any interest in using it as a tool. I’ve long thought it might help facilitate guildmembers signing up for a raid, managing rosters, etc, as the guildmembers themselves could update it, and you’re not reliant on one webmaster or officer to step up.</p>
<p>I integrated <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/PHPBB/Users_Integration">this hack</a> to use logins from the guild forums into the Wiki, which was quite helpful. And my lack of knowledge around PHP &amp; CSS started to show as I spend two hours last night, just playing with the header image. There aren’t a lot of good tutorials on creating a skin – especially one with a Novell-type flavor that utilizes a Wiki as a normal website. I came across <a href="http://jnana.wikinerds.org/index.php/how_to_create_your_own_MediaWiki_skin">this one</a>, but it was pretty darn high level, and didn’t even go into the PHP elements.</p>
<p>I’m going to tinker with it, especially the navigation pieces and see what happens. I’m also curious from a social networking experiment to see if any guildmembers latch on to it.</p>

            <description>Patrick Hruby of ESPN.com, has written an editorial that questions if Madden is too realistic on the Xbox 360, why some people don’t like that level of realism, and why some of us will always prefer Super Tecmo Bowl.
Worth a read.</description>

 The Chargers’ powder blue unis are the best in football Unless you are the San Diego Chargers, you should not wear alternate jerseys Dom Capers is sooo fired I really, really like Carson Palmer The Minneapolis Star-Tribune’s headline this morning was right on: Kick. Win. Repeat. I really do think the Colts will go undefeated.

            <description>Speaking of building a MAME cabinet before, came across this at Digg.com today: Emucation.Com, download roms. They claim to be legal, but I’m not sure how (yet), unless they’re truly abandonware.
Linked off of their emulator page, is Advance Projects, which includes AdvancedMAME (an emulator), AdvanceMenu (a menu program for collating all your ROMs), and AdvanceCD, a LiveCD that only takes up 20 megs, so you can fill the rest of the CD with your ROMs, stick it in any PC, power it on and it’s a full blown MAME box.</description>

            <description>The link of the day is Postsecret.
Extremely popular at Technorati, I had never heard of it, and it’s pretty interesting. What is it, you ask? From the site itself:
 PostSecret is an ongoing community art project where people mail-in their secrets anonymously on one side of a homemade postcard.
 And they put up the pictures of said postcards.</description>

            <description>Newsforge has a pretty good review of Flock up.
I’ve downloaded the Linux client, and while stable, I haven’t really used enough of it to comment yet. It brings together a number of tools I use while browsing, including Flickr and blogging. Delicious bookmarks are definitely something I want to get into a lot more, especially since I share so many computers.

            <description>The long-promised XM channels have finally shown up on DirecTV. Over 50 different channels covering all types of music. (How many does XM offer on their paid subscription? – Ok, I checked, over 150).
Stations include the Squizz, Fred &amp;amp; Ethel, so I’m definitely set. Then you have your standards, like 80’s, pop, rock, a few R&amp;amp;B stations.
What’s nice, is similar to DirecTV’s last music service, Music Choice, is each song pops up with some text on the TV screen showing you artist, song, album, year, etc.</description>

            <description>Basement progress is slow, but I’ve enjoyed the first two days of my vacation.
There is so much drywall dust it’s amazing – I’ve vacuumed, and swept no less than 4 times, and still there is a coat of dust on the floor.
We’ve got the paint, did some shopping today and picked out the tile, carpet, and maybe some cabinets. Got the plastic and some painters tape, and tomorrow the real fun starts.</description>

            <description>I don’t understand the black out rules around NFL’s Sunday Ticket on DirecTV.
Last week, the Packers the play the Steelers at 3:15 on CBS. CBS stays long on the Raiders / Chiefs, so I flip to the Sunday ticket channel for the Packer game. No go, it’s blacked out, as it usually is when broadcast on the local station.
While I appreciate CBS for staying with the hot game, I was annoyed that I couldn’t see the game I wanted to see, when I supposedly pay for “all” the games.</description>

<p>While I appreciate CBS for staying with the hot game, I was annoyed that I couldn’t see the game I wanted to see, when I supposedly pay for “all” the games.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Packers are at the Falcons, 3:15 on Fox. The Vikings are the noon game, and are going long. I switch to the Sunday ticket channel, assuming the Redskins / Buccaneers game is the game of the week at 3:15, and watch the Packer game on Sunday ticket. At halftime, the signal is disconnected. Sure enough, the Packer game is on the local Fox affiliate.</p>
<p>So why one week do I get the game and one week I don’t? Is it up to Fox and CBS to determine when DirecTV puts the blackout in effect? Worked out for me yesterday, but still annoying.</p>

            <description>And… we’re back.
Not that this hasn’t already posted everywhere on the intraweb right now, but is still very cool. Someone with way too much time on their hands has transcoded all 6 Star Wars movies and is watching them simultaneously and noting all the similarities.
Some are to say, at the least, quite interesting parallels in some of the movies, just from a time perspective.

            <description>Donna Wentworth gives you an overview of how Blizzard is spying on you.
If this was the government, as the article points out, they’d have to get a warrant.
What’s even more distrurbing to me, is the blog comments on this article – the gamers just don’t care if it stops cheating. This is right up there with those who say “I have nothing to hide, let the government videotape/phonetap/etc”.</description>

<p>Where do personal rights start and end? Just because you click on a EULA, does it <em>really</em> give a software company the right to capture what programs you’re running, who and what you’re communicating over instant messenger, and what websites you’ve visited?</p>

            <description>Ubuntu Blog has one of the most useful tips yet: How to mount a remote filesystem using SSH.
This is going to be big for me: I can mount my different webservers, hack my Terrastation and mount that using SSH, and all my other boxen.
Why use GNOME-VFS now? SSH is much more stable.
Thanks Ubuntu Blog!</description>

            <description>I’ve received a number of questions over the years of where the name “Silwenae” came from. It was randomly generated in Everquest – the second name I chose within EQ. It was unique enough that I stuck with it, including registering 3 domains. (And for the record, it’s pronounced sill-win-ay).
CmdrTaco, co-founder of , has written an op-ed piece on Slashdot on how Blizzard made him change his name due to the use of “Cmdr”, a title, in his World of Warcraft name, and how it’s affected him.</description>

<p>Online persona’s are interesting – there is a lack of accountability in using a handle for your pixels. There’s safety in anonymity. It wasn’t until recently I even put my real name on my blog – not out of safety, but out of privacy. (Though smart interweb people just look at Internic to see who owns a domain, and I’ve never faked that). I grew up on BBS’s, and using popular characters from books I liked – and I see that trend every day online (how many Drizzt’s did you see back in the EQ days?)</p>
<p>What does an online handle mean to you?</p>

            <description>Flickr has finally begun to offer online printing of photo’s (if you’re in the U.S.). They have a FAQ up, and prices appear to start at $0.20 for 4×6 and go up from there, so it’s competitive. Looking at the Flickr Blog, I see they’re also available for in-store pickup at Target. Very smart.
What’s interesting, is you, as the photo owner, can limit who can order prints from your photo’s.</description>

CartoonBrew.com is reporting that Turner Classic Movies is planning to air 9 Miyazaki films (the one’s Disney acquired distribution rights for) in January. The titles include Spirited Away, Kiki’s Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind, Castle in the Sky, Porco Rosso and Whisper of the Heart.
If you haven’t seen a Miyazaki film – even the popular ones such as Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away, you owe it to yourself to check out these animated classics.</description>

            <description>Playing around with the hacked X-Box, I figured out how to edit the XML configuration file to have My Music &amp;amp; My Movies on the XBMC point directly to my Buffalo Terrastation that houses all my movies and music – no more network browsing to get there, nice and easy.
Then I did something which I haven’t done in forever, which was hop on IRC. Got the link to download some emulators, and threw up MameOX and a Sega Genesis emulator.</description>

Threw some roms on the X-Box, and I was playing Elevator Action.

            <description>I soft-modded my X-Box tonight and am currently listening to an album in MP3 located on a network share on an external hard drive in my den from the comfort of my living room as I type this.
I used the Mech Assault hack to get the Evolution X dashboard installed, and then just FTP’d over the software for X-Box Media Center.
Reading the instructions X-Box Scene seemed daunting. 30 steps, downloading this file and that file, modifying files, etc.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=215055">soft-modded</a> my X-Box tonight and am currently listening to an album in MP3 located on a network share on an external hard drive in my den from the comfort of my living room as I type this.</p>
<p>I used the Mech Assault hack to get the Evolution X dashboard installed, and then just FTP’d over the software for <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/">X-Box Media Center</a>.</p>
<p>Reading the instructions <a href="http://www.xbox-scene.com/">X-Box Scene</a> seemed daunting. 30 steps, downloading this file and that file, modifying files, etc. In reality, it was just a few steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug in the memory card into a controller and turn the X-Box on</li>
<li>Copy the MechAssault save file from the controller to the hard drive</li>
<li>Reboot the X-Box with MechAssault and load the savegame which starts the softmod installer</li>
<li>Follow the instructions, including backup your files, and Evolution X is installed</li>
<li>Go to a PC and download the X-Box Media Center file and extract it</li>
<li>Edit one file and follow the instructions in the notes of the file</li>
<li>Look at your IP address on the X-Box dashboard and go to a PC. FTP in to your X-Box</li>
<li>FTP all the XBMC files to your apps directory on your modded X-Box</li>
<li>Reboot the X-Box. From the Evolution X dashboard, choose Applications and choose X-Box Media Center</li>
</ol>
<p>Voila – you’re running XBMC. I went in to Music, chose look over the network, chose my Buffalo Terrastation’s workgroup, and 30 seconds later was listening to Liz Phair – and it automatically uploads the songs you’re listening to Last.fm, which I mentioned in the blog a week or two ago.</p>
<p>It’s pretty slick – the UI is fantastic, the applications and formats XBMC supports is impressive, and the performance is blowing away the experience I had using Microsoft’s Media Center Extender for X-Box.</p>
<p>I have some research to do to see if I can automount samba shares (which could be really slick when I have MythTV working later) but for now automounting music and photo’s would make me very happy.</p>

            <description>Congratulations to the winners: Fazin overall, Stirling in 2nd, Haf and Vhex tied for 3rd. (Updated per Haf’s comment).
Overall, the event was even better than last year. Well coordinated and executed, and a ton of fun. The food and drinks were good, the games and gamers even better, and a ton of fun was had by all. Except for Vhex placing for a second year in a row.</description>

            <description>Jenny, Jim’s (Fazin/eth0) wife sits down and spanks us all in her first time playing Flatout. Towards the end of the match she’s playing (and winning) as she answers a call on her cell phone.
Beginner’s luck!

Good thing as I sucked seriously at Lastetron last night and started the morning with negative points.

            <description>Try, try again.
Or at least that’s what the MPAA thinks. The Broadcast Flag is being revived by the MPAA and 20 member of the House have pledged their support to it.
Danny O’Brien of the EFF breaks it down for you.
This is a must-read if you care about digital television. The MPAA’s attempts to ramrod this through backdoor legislation is appalling.</description>

            <description>The Linux &amp;amp; GNOME communities are all abuzz with the announcement yesterday of BetterDesktop.org and the Tango Desktop Project.
Better Desktop has published many usability videos of folks trying to do basic projects, and share those videos to make the user experience better. (Better Desktop is sponsored by Novell).
The Tango Project goal is:
 While the look and feel of an application is determined by many components the initial work has been done on unifying the look of the individual icon sets.</description>

<p>Sponsored by Novell/Suse, it’s interesting to see them moving forward with this, as one of my constant complaints with SUSE is it’s KDE-centric icons. Yup, I’m a user not a developer, so I like my eye candy. I have high hopes, as the team involved crosses distributions, including Novell (Ximian), Red Hat, and Mozilla developers to just name a few.</p>

            <description>I’m excited to see that Quake IV will have Linux support via a client patch within a few weeks (the game went gold last week).
You have to love iD Software for doing the right thing – whether it’s Linux clients or GPL’ing the source of their games when they are done with them.
Though the PC Gamer review score of 70% is a little worrisome.
But it’s Raven and iD, and I love both studios for their quality work.</description>

            <description>I upgraded Ubuntu on my laptop from Colony 3 to Preview 1. I’m finally wireless again – it’s something to sit on the couch in front of the TV and surf (and blog). I needed to get everything running for my trip this weekend so I can blog the LAN party and upload the pictures in real time to Flickr.
My wireless settings for Centrino weren’t working on Colony 3, but a quick apt-get upgrade and double checking my ESSID and WEP and everything is up and running again.</description>

<p>What a change from Hoary – getting Centrino support was a bear and then some. From upgrading the firmware and the drivers, this time it was just a matter of activating it.</p>
<p>Now I have to find the instructions somewhere on the net to get the pretty blue light working again when the wireless is on. 🙂</p>

            <description>Here’s why I like the EFF.
The EFF has filed a brief in support of DirecTV against a website operator who is suing DirecTV for accessing his website. Basically, if you want to make your website private, set up a password – you don’t have a right to say “don’t enter here if you work for so and so” which this yahoo is trying to do.
What do I like about it?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here’s why I like the <a href="http://www.eff.org">EFF</a>.</p>

<p>What do I like about it? EFF has gone after DirecTV in the past. From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EFF has opposed DirecTV in the past for its legal campaign against “smart cards,” and co-sponsors a website, <a href="http://www.directvdefense.org">www.directvdefense.org</a>, designed to help those who have been sued by DirecTV. However, as Bankston said, “When it comes to protecting the rights of Internet users, EFF doesn’t hold a grudge. We may oppose DirecTV in other cases, but here, it’s plainly on the correct side.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the EFF is on the side of what’s right – it doesn’t always matter who.</p>

            <description>Minnesota Public Radio’s music station, 89.3 The Current has launched a group blog called the Current Cue for their DJ’s.
One of the more interesting posts so far, their computer which houses all the music crashed. Apparently they rip all their CDs to PC to play on the air. Interesting story on what happened.
It makes me wonder though – if they’re playing music over the air digitally, what format are they using?</description>

<p>It makes me wonder though – if they’re playing music over the air digitally, what format are they using? It has to be a lossless codec, and there are only a few of those that would work. FLAC? SHN? Windows Media Lossless? Or do they just rip it straight to wav? I wonder what kind of RAID redundancy they have set up for something like that.</p>

            <description>Seb Payne reviews SUSE 10 OSS so you don’t have to. More of a mini-review, really, but it hits the good points.
YAST support is so-so and GNOME feels unfinished. One of the things that has driven me nuts about SUSE in the past is it’s KDE icons in GNOME – which it still retains.
Seb Payne is a Hula developer, and has been bouncing back from Ubuntu to SUSE and back again.</description>

            <description>Courtesy of Headshaver.org.
2 and a half years ago I debuted my new haircut, when I just had the stylist use the clippers on one all the way around. I’ve stuck with that since then, though I’ve gone no guard for the last few haircuts.
That haircut debuted right before a LAN party in Chicago 2 years ago sponsored by BFG. Their third annual one is next weekend, and in honor of that, I took the dive I’ve been talking about for the last year, and actually shaved my head.</description>

            <description>This week’s updates to the upcoming Breezy Badger release contain an “uh-oh”. The Ubuntu team has changed some of the default GNOME artwork, specifically replacing the GNOME foot with an Ubuntu logo.
Old Ubuntu taskbar:
New Ubuntu taskbar:
I can’t say I’m very happy about it. Sure, it’s extremely minor. But one of the things I love about Ubuntu is how close they’ve stayed to GNOME. Re-branding bits of it I can see, but I struggle with this one.</description>

            <description>A few new releases came out this week I just had to pickup:
 Liz Phair: Somebody’s Miracle Fiona Apple: Extraordinary Machine Public Enemy: New Whirl Order  I enjoyed Fiona’s first release, what, 10 years ago? Her second was good, but not as good. I’m looking forward to this after all the press about Fiona over the last two years. (Free Fiona!)
I’m a huge Liz Phair – have been since Exile in Guyville and have bought everything she’s done.</description>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lizphair.com">Liz Phair</a>: Somebody’s Miracle</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fiona-apple.com/">Fiona Apple</a>: Extraordinary Machine</li>
<li><a href="http://www.publicenemy.com">Public Enemy</a>: New Whirl Order</li>
</ul>
<p>I enjoyed Fiona’s first release, what, 10 years ago? Her second was good, but not as good. I’m looking forward to this after all the press about Fiona over the last two years. (Free Fiona!)</p>
<p>I’m a huge Liz Phair – have been since Exile in Guyville and have bought everything she’s done. 2003’s self-titled album was a bit of a shock as she transitioned to pop, and Somebody’s Miracle is in the same vein. Listened to the album almost twice now, and while her last album had 3 or 4 songs that popped at me right away, so far the new one only has one, which is her current release, Everything to Me, which is catchy as hell.</p>
<p>Public Enemy’s newest album in quite some time, New Whirl Order, was another must have. Other than the Beastie Boys, they’re the only rap group I’ve ever really, really gotten in to. I picked up their greatest hits disc a month or so back, and that was phenomenal. I’m looking forward to New Whirl Order.</p>

            <description>I continue to be impressed with Spam Karma 2 for WordPress since I installed in a couple weeks ago.
I was getting about 50 spam comments a day in the blog, and Spam Karma 2 has cut that down to nothing. Zero. Zilch. I think I’ve had to moderate 3 comments so far it wasn’t sure of (which were spam), but that’s nothing compared to the daily maintenance hell I used to go through in deleting comments.</description>

            <description>With the baby on the way, that will make 3, and 3 kids do not sit comfortably in a row in the back of my 2000 Ford Explorer, which we traded in.
We bought the XLE Sienna, which has a bunch of features, including heated leather seats, JBL sound system, power everything, and worst of all, some minor woodgrain in the center panel and on the inside front doors. Not too much thank god, but we bought the car sight unseen, as they were quickly running out of 2005s, and it was one of the few left in the state with the features we wanted.</description>

            <description>The Star Tribune has a story up about E. Adam Web, a man who scans city ordinances around signs and billboards and petitions cities to put up huge billboards, up to 672 feet high. When the city declines the request, he goes after them in court pointing out that the local ordinances are so confusing and outdated that a homeowner couldn’t even put up a “Go Vikings” sign in their own yard.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Star Tribune <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/5633292.html">has a story up</a> about E.

When the city declines the request, he goes after them in court pointing out that the local ordinances are so confusing and outdated that a homeowner couldn’t even put up a “Go Vikings” sign in their own yard.</p>
<p>This causes the entire ordinance to be struck down, and he gets his sign – which he then turns around and flips at a huge profit to someone who wants that advertising.</p>
<p>Mr. Webb claims he’s never lost a case yet out 110 completed or pending cases.</p>
<p>So the business model looks like:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find confusing city signage laws</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request a huge sign</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sue the city</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Profit!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the American legal system at work.</p>

            <description>Over the last month or so since I migrated Silwenae.com over to Site5 for hosting, and transferred the silwenae.com content to Apatheia.org I’ve been working on the image module in Drupal as it stopped working during the site migration.
I’ve been through the code, I’ve re-installed the module, and nothing has worked. I decided to tackle it this weekend, with mixed results.
I upgraded Apatheia.org’s Druapl installation from 4.5.5 to 4.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last month or so since I migrated Silwenae.com over to <a href="http://www.site5.com">Site5</a> for hosting, and transferred the silwenae.com content to <a href="http://www.apatheia.org">Apatheia.org</a> I’ve been working on the image module in <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> as it stopped working during the site migration.</p>
<p>I’ve been through the code, I’ve re-installed the module, and nothing has worked. I decided to tackle it this weekend, with mixed results.</p>
<p>I upgraded Apatheia.org’s Druapl installation from 4.5.5 to 4.6.3 so it was running the latest version. (No problems there).</p>
<p>I downloaded the image.module for 4.6 and installed it. (No problems there).</p>
<p>In reviewing the images in the website, the root web directory of apatheia.org does not have an images directory. Looking at my backup of silwenae.com, it had an images directory with all the images stored in it, including all the re-sized images that the image.module made. Where did they go?</p>
<p>To further complicate things, when you look at the images stored on Apatheia.org, take a look at the Majordomo story on the frontpage. According to the image properties, it’s at: <a href="http://www.apatheia.org/images/majordomo2-312">http://www.apatheia.org/images/majordomo2-312</a>_800x600.jpg , but there is no images directory when I ssh in to the website, or FTP in. Is Drupal doing something via mod_rewrite? Per one post on the forums, I turned clean URLs on, but it didn’t fix my image upload problem.</p>
<p>In the image.module settings, I changed from using ImageMagick to GD, and I could now upload a picture, though the thumbnail wouldn’t store, and it errored out upon submitting.</p>
<p>I did a chmod on the tmp directory, and pointed the settings a few different ways at the current tmp directory with mixed results. I re-created an images directory.</p>
<p>You can now upload images, with some caveats:</p>
<p>Upon selecting an image to upload and hitting preview, you see the image with the following error at the top of the screen:</p>
<p><code>warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /home/apatheia/public_html/modules/image/image.module on line 623.</code></p>
<p>Hitting submit off this preview results in an error page with the errors:</p>
<p>`warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /home/apatheia/public_html/modules/image/image.module on line 623.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, then going back to Apatheia.org (use a bookmark or something) you’ll see the image uploaded just fine.</p>
<p>So it’s working – it spits out errors, but it’s working. The image properties still show in apatheia.org/images – <em>but there are no files in that directory</em>! I’d love to know where they are.</p>
<p>The image.module in Drupal is notoriously buggy – the number of threads in the forums looking for help with the module are staggering. There aren’t a lot of good alternatives. Gallery2 integration exists, but I don’t think it’s quite what I’m looking for.</p>
<p>It’s frustrating as the functionality that was there in 4.5 was perfect – it was great for the users of the site, the re-sizing functionality was very cool. My only beef with it then was it was a little difficult to post stories around the pictures (though you could bump pictures up to the front page) but this one has me beat.</p>

            <description>I missed 45 minutes of Destination: Lost Wednesday night because of a major storm that ripped through the Twin Cities. (It was no Category 3 or higher storm, but it did a little damage).
The local ABC affiliate, Channel 5 KSTP, used the hurricane system and people’s fears of those storms to sensationalize the storm reporting for as long as they could, including 45 minutes of Destination: Lost and the first 20 minutes of the season premiere of Lost.</description>

<p>The local ABC affiliate, Channel 5 KSTP, used the hurricane system and people’s fears of those storms to sensationalize the storm reporting for as long as they could, including 45 minutes of Destination: Lost and the first 20 minutes of the season premiere of Lost.</p>
<p>I have it on my TiVo – it’s just them repeating themselves for an hour – high winds, look at the radar, blah blah blah.</p>
<p>But that gets me to my point: ABC is <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/389/5630010.html">unwilling to re-broadcast the premiere</a> this weekend, due to cast contracts and the residual payouts. At least they’re admitting it’s about the money, so they can screw over their viewers.</p>
<p>Being technologically aware, I just went out and <a href="http://www.torrentspy.com/directory.asp?mode=sub&amp;id=303">downloaded it</a> from an HDTV rip and burned it to DVD. 42 minutes long now and no commercials – just because my local affiliate wouldn’t broadcast it.</p>
<p>And the television industry considers this an illegal act. An over the air television show, currently stored on my TiVo, and I can’t go download a copy and watch it on my TV. I purchased Lost Season One on DVD a week and a half ago. I’ll spend money where it’s deserved, for a quality and innovative program like Lost.</p>
<p>But yet, god forbid you miss one show in a series, you are not supposed to download them. What if it’s a show like Lost, Alias or 24 where you miss one episode and it can seriously set you back in understanding the plot?</p>
<p>The TV industry needs to get with the times then and offer a technological solution if they want to make this illegal. They should be ashamed of themselves for being the Luddites they are. <a href="http://www.eff.org/legal/cases/betamax/">Sony Betamax vs. Universal</a> was settled over 20 years ago and yet here is history repeating itself.</p>

It’s pretty cool so far – after listening to only two or three different artists it already had Weezer at the top of the recommended list for me, and I’m a huge Weezer fan.</description>

            <description>A follow-up from my visit to Houston last week: I finally had the chance to eat at a Sonic, “America’s Drive-In”.
The funny thing is, none of us had any idea it was only a drive-in. I see the commericals all the time on ESPN, and have wanted to stop there to see what it was all about. I see the breakfast food commericals about ten times more often than I do for their burgers.</description>

<p>The funny thing is, none of us had any idea it was <em>only</em> a drive-in. I see the commericals all the time on ESPN, and have wanted to stop there to see what it was all about. I see the breakfast food commericals about ten times more often than I do for their burgers.</p>
<p>They were all over Houston, I saw more Sonic’s than McDonald’s (which is fine with me). Drive through or drive-in are your only choices, maybe outdoor seating if you were lucky. Had a Jalapeno Double Burger with Tater Tots and a Lime-ade, all three of which were quite good for fast food.</p>
<p>Definitely better than your normal chains such as Hardees, McD’s or BK. Step up from Culvers ups here in the north, but not quite as good as an In ‘N Out out west.</p>
<p>And our thoughts are with you for those of you in Houston right now.</p>

            <description>I’m very intrigued by Last.fm, formerly Audioscrobbler.
Download a plugin for your favorite music player (Linux players included!) and start listening to music. From there Last.fm will start recommending music to you based on what you and others listened to that’s similar.
I can’t do justice to explaining it, so go read the FAQ. I’m very intrigued in Last.fm as a way to get introduced to more music, but not sold on using XMMS as my music player as I love Muine and am starting to test Banshee.</description>

            <description>I was taking a peek at WordPress.com (more on that in a minute) and it showed one of the top hosted blogs there is the Ubuntu weblog.
It already has some nice tips and tricks posted (like the bash command append). I’ll definitely be adding that to my blogroll.
WordPress.com is similar to Movable Type – hosted blog solution for users who don’t want or have a server to host their own blog on.</description>

            <description>I had mentioned in my Colony 4 upgrade post some of the problems I was having. It turns out the icons weren’t appearing because I had a custom theme chosen. Choosing Clearlooks set everything right again, though Ubuntu seems to have changed the Tomboy icons in the panel and in the Applications menu.
Doing an apt-get upgrade after getting home from traveling resulted in 24 hours of panic. Upon upgrading, my networking stopped working.</description>

It seems I wasn’t <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=65253">the only one with this problem</a>, but thankfully one of the posters in that thread mentioned how the upgrade seemed to have stopped half way through. Going to a terminal and doing another apt-get upgrade and a reboot fixed the problem, thank god.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m still very happy with Breezy Badger. I’m waiting for the X.org packages to get a bit more stable as it seems I upgrade them almost daily and then I’ll get my monitor and ATI drivers working properly.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks from Breezy Badger going final!</p>

            <description>And… I’m back. Spent most of last week traveling in Houston for work. This was my first significant time spent in the big ole state of Texas, and in some ways it’s a different world down there.
First, housing is much cheaper. Like 50% cheaper than here – and with no state income tax, cost of living must be much lower. It was 90 and humid all week – I loved it.</description>

<p>First, housing is much cheaper. Like 50% cheaper than here – and with no state income tax, cost of living must be much lower. It was 90 and humid all week – I loved it. I had the opportunity to go to Minute Maid Park and watch the Astro’s play. It feels like they just tried to cram a MLB stadium into a few spare blocks they had open in downtown – the place is tiny. All the modern amenities, but looking into the outfield and just seeing walls and no bleachers wasn’t right.</p>
<p>Demographics were very different. Texas state flags were everywhere – they don’t call it the Lonestar State for nothing.</p>
<p>Now, back to blogging.</p>

            <description>I upgraded my main computer with Ubuntu’s Hoary Hedgehog release from May ’04 to the latest version of testing (Colony 4) Tuesday night. I wanted to perform the upgrade with the release of GNOME 2.12 Wed., and Breezy Badger about a month out.
I used apt-get to perform the install, and considering it’s not even to preview version, some things went right and some things went wrong.
The Good:
  Updated my /etc/apt/sources.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I upgraded my main computer with <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu’s</a> Hoary Hedgehog release from May ’04 to the latest version of testing (Colony 4) Tuesday night. I wanted to perform the upgrade with the release of <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.12/">GNOME 2.12</a> Wed., and Breezy Badger about a month out.</p>
<p>I used apt-get to perform the install, and considering it’s not even to preview version, some things went right and some things went wrong.</p>
<p>The Good:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updated my /etc/apt/sources.list and replaced all instances of “Hoary” with “Breezy”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It took about 20 minutes to install and upgrade, had a few instances where I had to force (-f) the packages</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ATI binary drivers aren’t in Breezy yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My xorg.conf file is pretty messed up. My original Hoary xorg.conf included the actual scan lines for my Dell 2405 monitor. I ran through the manual setup script and removed one bad resolution (1920 x 1440) and am using DRI to draw the desktop. At least I get to the desktop to that way, though I currently have no 3d acceleration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ugly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My icons are pretty messed up – I’ll post a screenshot tonight. Including icons on the panel (Tomboy specifically) and on the desktop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I keep my desktop clean of icons, with the exception of my Samba and SSH links to my remote servers. Those icons are messed up, as is Nautilus, including the new spatial tree view.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, GNOME still feels snappy, even in DRI mode, and I’m fairly excited about some of the new features, especially the spatial tree view in Nautilus.</p>

            <description>After all the problems I’ve had getting my Vonage up and running to interact properly with my TiVo, I thought I had it totally fixed.
Yet all last week, I had horrible latency on my network, that was resulting in long pauses when on the phone, and then my web browsing became very, very slow. Not quite dial-up quality, but definitely not broadband. It was very frustrating, especially as I needed to get some stuff fixed on Apatheia.</description>

Not quite dial-up quality, but definitely not broadband. It was very frustrating, especially as I needed to get some stuff fixed on Apatheia.org.</p>
<p>Friday I brought home a different router to see if that would work. First I upgraded the firmware on my current router, and then went to check a website on my 2nd machine that does all my email and IM that I don’t use a lot for web browsing.</p>
<p>Wait – what’s that in the bottom corner of the screen below Firefox? Sure enough, it was a Bittorrent client I had open from the previous Saturday downloading OpenSuse. It had started really, really slow – 1 – 2k download. But it had definitely finished strong as it was now uploading at 40k / second – using all of my available 384k upload speed. Turn that off, and voila – all my latency problems fixed.</p>
<p>Whoops.</p>

            <description>I’ll have to agree whole-heartedly with Jeff Waugh on this one: Reampsire!
Here’s a Linux company who went after Microsoft with their first name (Lindows), then took Microsoft’s money to the tune of $20 million to change it, going after a project that was more dissimilar than they were when they were called Linspire.
And then, to top it off, the article itslef is belittling and insulting to other Linux distributions.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ll have to agree whole-heartedly with <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/blog/issues/desktop/1125704055">Jeff Waugh on this one</a>: <a href="http://info.linspire.com/freespire/index.html">Reampsire!</a></p>
<p>Here’s a Linux company who went after Microsoft with their first name (Lindows), then took Microsoft’s money to the tune of $20 million to change it, going after a project that was more dissimilar than they were when they were called Linspire.</p>
<p>And then, to top it off, the article itslef is belittling and insulting to other Linux distributions. No matter how many flamewars go on at any given time in the Linux community, there is always some respect between distributions and it’s users. <em>Because you’ve made the right choice and that choice is Linux</em>.</p>
<p>Yet Linspire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name Freespire, however, did create some confusion in the short time it was used. The name implies a “free” copy of Linspire, which of course it is not. The very things that were taken out of Linspire for Andrew’s project are in fact some of the very things that make Linspire, well…Linspire. One of the main differences between Linspire and other Linux distros (Mandriva, Ubuntu, MEPIS, etc.) is that Linspire does include a lot of legal and paid-for 3rd-party licenses for things like mp3, Java, Flash, Quick Time, Windows Media, Bitstream fonts, Real media, music, etc., and this is all pre-loaded, tested and ready to use. Take all that away and you don’t have Linspire, you have something more like other Linux distros. So you see, the term Freespire (free + Linspire) is actually an oxymoron and would be a term like VanillaChocolateCake, where you take out all the chocolate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Andrew has decided to change the name of his project to ‘squiggle’ to avoid any confusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The only true “Freespire,” would need to be a FREE COPY of the real LINSPIRE.</p>
</blockquote>

            <description>I recently received a Buffalo 600gig Terrastation to test from work.
I’ve been looking for a NAS / SAN storage solution for a while, but most USB NAS solutions I’ve looked at don’t support Linux. The Terrastation is a work of art. Full support for every OS, including Windows, Mac &amp;amp; Linux, easy setup, multiple RAID options, and a very easy setup.
It has default Samba settings, and in Windows shows up as a network share, unlike SAN’s which will show up as a drive letter.</description>

<p>It has default Samba settings, and in Windows shows up as a network share, unlike SAN’s which will show up as a drive letter. (Mirra only supports backing up from a drive letter, but oh well, wasn’t happy with Mirra as it was a Windows only solution).</p>
<p>It’s pretty slick – a very basic setup from Windows, but like routers on the market today, a full-fledged web page for setting it up on the box itself. It’s basically a Linux box, running off a PPC processor. Full support for users and groups, Raid 0, 1 and 5 (5 default out of the box!), FTP access, drive spanning and user secured shares.</p>
<p>I’ve had it about two weeks, and lo and behold, I see on <a href="http://www.planetgnome.org">Planet Gnome</a> this morning, a Gnome developer <a href="http://www.chipx86.com/blog/archives/000117.html">blogged his experiences with it</a>, including hacking at it. He has the upgrade from mine, the 1 Terrabyte (I have the 600 gig), and points to a nice <a href="http://www.terastation.org/wiki/Main_Page">hacker’s Wiki at terastation.org</a> all about adding customized firmware to the Terrastation, including SSH and NFS support. I’m looking forward to getting SSH up so I can use SCP as well.</p>
<p>Overall, the machine is pretty cool. Pretty quiet, but 4 drives and their vibrations make some noise, and the lights on the front, including 4 seperate places for each drive to show status is very cool.</p>

            <description>I’ve been researching this for years, and waiting for the right moment, and that moment is quickly coming in to focus. That moment will entail buying all of the parts for a Home Theater PC and installing MythTV said HTPC.
What is MythTV, you ask? It’s a software program for Linux distributions, that manages all the media – TV recording, DVD playback, DVD ripping, burn TV to DVD, music, weather and more.</description>

<p>More to come in the coming months.</p>

            <description>Google has launched Google Talk a day early. Turns out Google is running one big Jabber server. Get yourself an IM client that is Jabber compatible such as Gaim and do this:
  Open a client supporting Jabber (AdiumX, Gaim, etc.)
  Your server name is talk.google.com
  Your username is the same as your Google ID. Example: user@gmail.com
  Your password is the same as you use to login to Gmail or other Google login locations.</description>

            <description>Why, oh why, can Internet Explorer not conform to web standards?
I threw up a placeholder on Silwenae.com using Drupal, and put a transparent PNG as the header graphic.
Looks awesome in Firefox, but IE you see the background.
I hate IE. I don’t want to use a GIF due to patent issues, and JPEGs can’t handle transparency.
Grr.
Silwenae.com 5.0 is up, and a history of it is coming soon.</description>

            <description>Damn, this sucks: V for Vendetta has been delayed from November until March.
I recently bought the graphic novel again, which I hadn’t read in years, and it was still as powerful as ever. I highly recommend it. The movie adapation from what I’ve seen and heard isn’t 100% true to the book, but I still have high hopes.</description>

            <description>As seen on Gizmodo today, Sony has unleashed a press releasing introducing the KDS-R60XBR1 and KDS-R50XBR1 Grand WEGA LCOS televesions.
 Sony Electronics today introduced two new sets in the line based on the acclaimed Silicon X-tal (Crystal) Reflective Display (SXRD™) technology delivering full 1920 x 1080 high-definition resolution.
 1920×1080 in 1080p is a beautiful thing. Featuring 2 HDMI inputs, 3 Firewire, and one VGA input, I can plug in almost anything.</description>

<p>1920×1080 in 1080p is a beautiful thing. Featuring 2 HDMI inputs, 3 Firewire, and one VGA input, I can plug in almost anything. Running the V for Vendetta trailer in full blown 1920x1080p on a PC through the VGA input should be stunning. Also features a memory stick reader for photos.</p>
<p>I’ve been hearing from a good friend about this TV for quite some time, it’s nice to see it’s official. This is the same chipset in their current 70″ $25,000 set and is now being released for the rest of us at normal pricing of $4000 and $5000 (thank god!).</p>

Now it’s time to start thinking about the new silwenae.com.
If I don’t have time to update my blog, I’ll have to figure out how to find time for web development again!</description>

Oxygenz.net was shut down this weekend due to a faulty PHP script. Based on the draconian rules set up by that webhost, Fazin and I decided to switch webhosts (again), this time to Site5.com. (Silwenae.org is proudly hosted on Nearlyfreespeech.net, as a backup to everything else.</description>

<p>Fazin spent all night Sunday transferring the data back up, and we’ve moved all the content from Silwenae.com to Apatheia.org which Fazin had registered a few months ago and had just been pointing at Silwenae.com.</p>
<p>The data’s up, including the databases, but we have some bug hunting ahead of us as you can’t log in to the Drupal site or into the forums.</p>
<p>All of the Apatheia guild stuff will be moving to:</p>

            <description>Our independence from England has been revoked (by John Cleese of all people).
John Cleese shares the Declaration of Revocation:
 Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories.
Except Utah, which she does not fancy.
Your new Prime Minister (The Right Honourable Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a Minister for America without the need for further elections.</description>

            <description>More goodness today via BoingBoing:
A diary entry on DailyKos by RadicalRuss nails the hypocrisy of the Grokster case in comparing it to the gun industry.
This is a must read.
From the story:
 Got that? If a company makes a product that is inappropriately used to illegally copy a movie, that company is liable. If a company makes a product that is inappropriately used to illegally kill a human, that company is not liable.</description>

            <description>Via BoingBoing:
The RIAA has ordered a take down notice to RPG Films. RPG films is a machinima site that takes animation made from video game / video game engines to make short movies and films. Some of them included music video’s – which is where the RIAA had a problem.
How is this not fair use? There is no MP3 to download . Only the most sophisticated computer user could figure out how to seperate the audio from the video, and even then the quality would be awful – with a video file you’re trying to compress it down as far as you can to save your users’ bandwidth.</description>

            <description>USA Today’s Michael Hiestand’s column covers the shifts in the TV network’s announcer lineups now that NBC has picked up Sunday Night Football.
Let me express my disappointment in the quality of announcers on the air in the #1 lineups. In no particular order:
 John Madden: Too old, too much of a showboat, and has lost his touch with today’s game Joe Theisman: Not many original thoughts, was in the booth to argue with Paul Maguire (who was a much better color analyst than Theisman).</description>

<li>Joe Buck: Stick to baseball please.</li>
<li>Cris Collinsworth: Good riddance from Fox and the booth. Won’t have to put up with you calling Packer games, or on Sunday Night Football. Thank god.</li>
<li>Michelle Tafoya &amp; Suzy Kolber: I really enjoy both of their sideline reporting. Blows away Pam Oliver at Fox or anyone MNF had before Ms. Tafoya.</li>
<li>SNF / MNF losing Mike Patrick and Paul Maguire is a huge blow. I really, really enjoyed the way they called football games. Take out Maguire &amp; Theisman baiting each other, and it was the best broadcast of football weekly, including the analysis and ESPN’s presentation.</li>

Vote: Do players have a right to hold out?
SportsNation
Thank you for voting. See below for the results from across SportsNation.
Your responses in bold text below.
 Do you feel there is a legitimate difference between teams saving money by cutting players for performing below expectations and players holding out for more money after exceeding expectations?</description>

            <description>More goodness via Alice:
Alice came across a picture of herself in Second Life with her avatar hanging on the wall, by a player named always_black.
She then links to a story he wrote and calls it the best piece of gaming writing I ever did read.
And I agree. Go read it.</description>

            <description>On the advice of two cow-orkers, who coincidentally had the same printer, I purchased a Canon PIXMA iP6000D today. (Canon has a crappy website, btw).
I, however, forgot to see if it has Linux drivers available. (It doesn’t).
It’s for the wife more than me, as she needed a color printer, and the sample 4×6 photo I saw at the office was good. I’ve printed out 8-10 4×6 photo’s after hooking it up, and it’s phenomenal.</description>

<p>I, however, forgot to see if it has Linux drivers available. (It doesn’t).</p>
<p>It’s for the wife more than me, as she needed a color printer, and the sample 4×6 photo I saw at the office was good. I’ve printed out 8-10 4×6 photo’s after hooking it up, and it’s phenomenal. It’s amazing how far the technology has come. I printed off a bunch to hang in my cube at work. I’m quite interested in seeing how an 8×10 looks.</p>
<p>I’ve hooked it up to Kelly’s computer, and shared it over the network so I could print from my MCPC. I have a <a href="http://www.netgear.com/products/details/WGPS606.php">wireless Netgear print server</a> around here somewhere, I’ll have to give that a go.</p>
<p>I’m annoyed about the Linux thing though. Now I have to transfer my pictures from my main box to my MCPC to print. But the printer does have a 7-in-1 card reader, so I can always just stick the memory card in if I want, though it looks like I’d have to press a bunch of buttons on the printer which doesn’t look the most user friendly way to do it. Ah well.</p>

            <description>Almost a month ago Icculus announced in his .plan file he was porting a game called Second Life to Linux, and included 3 screenshots.
Second Life is a fascinating experiement in the MMO genre. In some ways made for developers, it lets you own land, create and trade various items, all with a built in content creation tool. From the What Is page:
 It is a palette for creative self-expression like nothing you have ever seen.</description>

<p>Already available for Mac OS X and Windows, I’m anxiously awaiting the Linux port to try this out.</p>

            <description>The trailer for V for Vendetta has been released. Available in standard Quicktime, or 1920×1280 HD in Quicktime 7 using the h.264 codec.
I had read the graphic novel over 10 years ago, and bought it and re-read it 3 weeks ago. I absolutely love the author, Alan Moore, and this particular story – though his books are 10x better than the movies that are turned out based on his source material, as he’s never been involved in any of the movies made from his books.</description>

<p>The imagery and themes seem very true to the comic book, though I’ve heard a few things about the movie that don’t ring true.</p>
<p>We’ll see – the Wachowski brothers adapted and produced it, and it stars Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman.</p>

            <description>Alex just finished his Little League season. There was one particular mother who rode her son to no end. About halfway through the season, he snapped, and told her off publically during the middle of the game. She rode him about where he stood at the plate, his constant strikeouts (poor kid was stressed by her, there wasn’t any pressure there, really), and his fielding. During one game, after striking out for the second time, she pulled him off the bench and told him she was going to teach him how to bunt since he couldn’t get a hit, and practiced that until the inning ended and they had to take the field.</description>

<p>Now, I’m no perfect parent either – there is no question I could be more active, and practice with my son more, or offer better encouragement.</p>
<p>But then I read <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/07-15-2005/4557000d79965d83.html">this story about a Coach who paid one of his players $25 to hit a disabled child in the head with a bat</a>. This coach had two daughters on his T-ball team, and didn’t want to coach an 8 year old disabled child.

            <description>Via Slashdot, comes a story at the Guardian that the BBC’s free downloads of Ludwig Van Beethoven’s symphonies have become the most popular songs ever legally downloaded.
Amazing:
 Final figures from the BBC show that the complete Beethoven symphonies on its website were downloaded 1.4m times, with individual works downloaded between 89,000 and 220,000 times. The works were each available for a week, in two tranches, in June.
 What does this teach?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/21/2040227&amp;tid=167&amp;tid=141&amp;tid=158&amp;tid=1&amp;tid=14">Via Slashdot</a>, comes a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/news/0,12597,1532890,00.html">story at the Guardian</a> that the BBC’s free downloads of Ludwig Van Beethoven’s symphonies have become the most popular songs ever legally downloaded.</p>
<p>Amazing:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>What does this teach? Free music works. And Classical has proved it – the music industry is amazed by it. And scared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not everyone was so positive. Some from the recording industry expressed concerns that the BBC was setting itself up as unfair competition in the recording market.</p>
<p>Mr Cosgrove said: “I would be worried if the BBC repeated the experiment. We would take an extremely dim view if it happened repeatedly.” But, he added: “It’s caused quite a bit of controversy – but it has also provided us with an amazing piece of free market research. I don’t think anyone had any idea in their wildest dreams that there would be this level of response. Yes, the downloads were free – but if charged at a commercial rate that would have been a huge amount of revenue.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know what music industry? <strong>Screw you.</strong> This music is in the public domain, and you haven’t served your market for offering classical music downloads as the article says. Once again, your arrogance has failed you.</p>
<p>Kudo’s to the BBC – They put on the concert, broadcast, and distributed it. And consumers listened and downloaded and the BBC gained customers.</p>
<p>And I was one of them, I downlaoded it.</p>

            <description>Two Minneapolis Star Tribune writers have a back and forth discussionon what they like and don’t like about 89.3, The Current.
It’s an above average article, and while I agree with most of it, there are parts I disagree with, though it does give you a good feeling for the station as a whole.

<p>It’s an above average article, and while I agree with most of it, there are parts I disagree with, though it does give you a good feeling for the station as a whole.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JB: What I want from a radio station is a DJ I could talk music with. On the Current, I could definitely talk music with Mary Lucia and Bill DeVille — my two favorites. I loved the other day when Mary said, “I’m still loving this, and I’ll slap anyone who says otherwise. Here’s the Redwalls.” And I could talk with Mark Wheat and Jill Riley, who I think is really improving. But for Thorn [DJ Skroch], I think our conversation would have to be via e-mail.</p>
<p>CR: Ultimately, I don’t care what their personalities are; I care about what they play. Bill DeVille definitely gets my vote in that department. I did a road trip on July 4th and didn’t once put in a CD thanks to him. He played sets such as Boomtown Rats with Betty Serveert with Gram Parsons with one of those especially weird new White Stripes songs.</p>

            <description>I installed a Netgear XE102 powerline to wireless adapter this morning to see if I could get my X-Box a better wireless signal.
Installation was a snap – I’m very imperssed how far powerline has come. Plug the powerline adapter into the wall, plug an ethernet cable into the same adapter in my den and into a switch. In my living room, I then plug in another adapter, and voila, instant wireless range extender.</description>

<p>Installation was a snap – I’m very imperssed how far powerline has come. Plug the powerline adapter into the wall, plug an ethernet cable into the same adapter in my den and into a switch. In my living room, I then plug in another adapter, and voila, instant wireless range extender. No setup, just works. And my X-Box went from poor to good signal quality (I’ll talk about my X-Box Media Center Extender experience in another post later).</p>
<p>Tied for the best experience with the installation, was the bright yellow business card I found in the Netgear box. With a big Netgear logo at the top, there is a paragraph of information underneath it that informs you that software used in building the product uses the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html">GNU General Public License</a> and the GNU Lesser General Public License. It also gives you a link to <a href="http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n101238.asp">download the sourcecode on Netgear.com</a>. (Ironic that a source code link directs you to an ASP page).</p>
<p><strong>Bravo Netgear!</strong> Bravo for calling out that you use open source in a document external to the manual or just in a website like some of your <a href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;packedargs=c%3DL_Content_C1%26cid%3D1115416836002&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper">competitors</a>.</p>

            <description>Bob Mould recently did an interview on 89.3 The Currentand after listening to the interview on-line (I only caught part of it in the car) he mentioned he had a new album coming out.
Sure enough, Googling for Bob Mould turns up his weblog with a big link to pre-order his new CD. The album comes out July 26 unless you pre-orded from Yep Rock Records in time, which I did.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bob Mould recently <a href="http://www.publicradio.org/tools/media/player/minnesota/radio/the_current/instudio/2005/07/20050705_bob_mould.pls">did an interview</a> on <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/thecurrent/">89.3 The Current</a>and after listening to the interview on-line (I only caught part of it in the car) he mentioned he had a new album coming out.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Googling for Bob Mould turns up <a href="http://modulate.blogspot.com/">his weblog</a> with a big link to <a href="http://www.yeproc.com/news.php?articleId=2041">pre-order his new CD</a>. The album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0009Y26WC/qid=1121648975/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/102-2983978-5252930?v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846">comes out July 26</a> unless you pre-orded from Yep Rock Records in time, which I did. It shipped last Tuesday, and I received it yesterday.</p>
<p>The album is great. Vintage Bob Mould, he returns to his 90’s sound with guitar driven sound, and hints of his recent foray into electronica with his last album Modulate. A good example of where the guitar + minor bits of electronica is <em>(Shine Your) Light Love Hope</em>, which mixes both sounds very well, as does <em>I am Vision I am Sound</em>. The next track on the album, <em>Paralyzed</em> is a great example of the power guitar that made Sugar and Bob Mould’s albums so well done. <em>Best Thing</em>, <em>Underneath Days</em> and <em>Missing You</em> are a fewyou have to check out for the signature Bob Mould guitar sound.</p>
<p>A few ballads are even thrown in to mix it up – <em>High Fidelity</em> slows it down, while <em>Gauze of Friendship</em> is well done on the acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>I purchased the 2 disc special edition, and am happy and sad at the same time. Happy that I got the 2nd (bonus) 9 track CD, with 2 remixes of <em>(Shine Your) Light Love Hope</em> and a remix of <em>Paralyzed</em>. The 2 disc set comes in a box, with extra artwork and the second disc (photo below).</p>
<p>I’m disappointed in that both discs are enclosed in a paper case, rather than a nicer jewel case. The artwork, while well done, as loose sheets that are jewel case sized, will probably never see the light of day outside the special edition box. I would have preferred a slightly larger box with both discs in a hard jewel case, which would make using in the car and treating right much easier.</p>
<p>The price for the pre-order was right – at first I thought $25 + $4 shipping was a bit high, but looking at Amazon’s pre-order price with a $29 retail and everyday price of $26 I actually got a deal. The music is vintage Bob Mould, well done, and well worth the money spent.</p>

            <description>I was surprised in the mail about a week and a half ago, when out of the blue I received:

I had re-upped my membership with the EFF in May, like I have for the last few years, and I was delighted to receive the bumper sticker, especially as I wasn’t expecting it. It was a nice touch, as was the accompanying letter.
Once I get this basement finished (someday), I’m going to have Kelly build me a shadow box to put that in, along with the silver membership sticker and letter I received when I first joined.</description>

            <description>As I mentioned two weeks ago, I’ve uploaded all the old photo’s I had to my Flickr.
It turned out to be just over a 1000 photo’s, with the most in the last two years. I had some good ones of Alex going back to 2001, and a ton of Zoe baby pictures.
They’re all uploaded, grouped in to sets, and I re-orded my set list to be in chronological order with all the kid photo’s.</description>

            <description>I have never read a Harry Potter book. As avid a reader as I am, once something hits the mainstream, especially so ferociously, I just have to be different and not do it. (I’ve never seen Titanic either).
With that said, I took Alex this morning to Target post-haste and we purchased Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
A number of years back when Harry Potter was just starting to become popular, my wife bought a couple of the books and read them to decide if we could read them aloud to Alex or let him read them when he was older.</description>

<p>Which led to being a good little American consumer this morning. I figure I won’t see Alex for a day or two until he’s done reading it.</p>

            <description>I’m back from California, and getting caught up on misc. stuff.
I’ve updated the theme to K2 Alpha 3, added a new Flickr badge, and still don’t care that it doesn’t work in Internet Explorer. Go get Firefox already.
I mentioned the Burn It Club a while back. The summer Burn It session is now on if any of my three readers want to do it with me. I have to say I’m struggling with the theme, but I really want to participate.</description>

            <description>Ars Technica does a deep dive into the real truth behind Apple’s switch from IBM to Intel.
Focusing on how Apple has shot itself in the foot in regards to it’s relationship with IBM, and what Intel stands to gain in the iPod arena, it covers some things I hadn’t thought of until now.
 One of the major factors in the switch was something that’s often been discussed here at Ars and elsewhere: Apple’s mercurial and high-handed relationship with its chip suppliers.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ars Technica does a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/columns/mac/mac-20050710.ars?85674&amp;79301">deep dive into the real truth behind</a> Apple’s switch from IBM to Intel.</p>
<p>Focusing on how Apple has shot itself in the foot in regards to it’s relationship with IBM, and what Intel stands to gain in the iPod arena, it covers some things I hadn’t thought of until now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the major factors in the switch was something that’s often been discussed here at Ars and elsewhere: Apple’s mercurial and high-handed relationship with its chip suppliers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the iPod:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the real reason behind the switch, you have to look to the fact that it’s the iPod and iTMS—not the Mac—that are now driving Apple’s revenues and stock price. As I stated in my previous article on the switch, Apple is more concerned with scoring Intel’s famous volume discounts on the Pentium (with its attendant feature-rich chipsets) and XScale lines than it is about the performance, or even the performance per Watt, of the Mac.</p>
<p>It’s critical to understanding the switch that you not underestimate the importance of Intel’s XScale to Apple’s decision to leave IBM. The current iPods use an ARM chip from Texas Instruments, but we can expect to see Intel inside future versions of the iPod line. So because Apple is going to become an all-Intel shop like Dell, with Intel providing the processors that power both the Mac and the iPod, Apple will get the same kinds of steep volume discounts across its entire product line that keep Dell from even glancing AMD’s way.</p>

            <description>Yes, I know silwenae.com is down.
I received an email from my hosting company that silwenae.com executed a denial of service attack approaching 100 Mb/s this morning resulting in the hosting company shutting my site down.
This is the second time my site has been exploited in the last 60 days. I’m starting to lose my patience.
I’m waiting for the hosting company to respond, and hopefuly re-activate my site.</description>

            <description>I’m playing with the newest release of the Kubrick theme, K2, which is in an early alpha.
It doesn’t work in Internet Explorer correctly on Windows XP (the right hand sidebar is off significantly), but I really don’t care anymore. I’m sick of tinkering with themes because IE doesn’t render CSS properly.
If you are still using IE (and why are you?) please switch to Mozilla’s Firefox.
I’m going to leave the default colors up for now, maybe tinker with the sidebar, and when it’s final, I’ll apply a black style / CSS (maybe from the old theme by neuro).</description>

            <description>On the Fourth of July, 89.3 The Current did a special, 50 Songs for 50 States, from 2pm until midnight.
Our timing driving back from Milwaukee was perfect, as the Rochester signal came in about quarter to 2, and we listened to it for the last few hours of the drive home, and I listened to it over the web for most of the night after that.
What a great mix of music – picking anywhere from 1-3 songs per state, either with the state’s name in the song / title, or an artist known for that state (like the Ramones for New York).</description>

            <description>William Gibson is another one who gets the remix culture.
In an article on Wired, Gibson writes of some of his early influences, including William S. Burroughs, author of Naked Lunch, one of the first authors to use sampling in literature.
 Later, attempting to understand this impact, I discovered that Burroughs had incorporated snippets of other writers’ texts into his work, an action I knew my teachers would have called plagiarism.</description>

<p>In an article on Wired, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.07/gibson.html">Gibson writes</a> of some of his early influences, including William S. Burroughs, author of <em>Naked Lunch</em>, one of the first authors to use sampling in literature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Later, attempting to understand this impact, I discovered that Burroughs had incorporated snippets of other writers’ texts into his work, an action I knew my teachers would have called plagiarism. Some of these borrowings had been lifted from American science fiction of the ’40s and ’50s, adding a secondary shock of recognition for me.</p>
<p>By then I knew that this “cut-up method,” as Burroughs called it, was central to whatever it was he thought he was doing, and that he quite literally believed it to be akin to magic. When he wrote about his process, the hairs on my neck stood up, so palpable was the excitement. Experiments with audiotape inspired him in a similar vein: “God’s little toy,” his friend Brion Gysin called their reel-to-reel machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be interesting to see if Mr. Gibson follows up on what he says he believes here, and introduces any type of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses on his books or how it affects him going forward.</p>

            <description>Via Slashdot:
Plaguelands has a summary up of the recent MMO roundtable hosted by IBM. Game Developers participating included Geoff Heath, CEO, NCsoft Europe &amp;amp; Steven Reid, NCsoft Europe; Raph Koster, Sony; and Patty Fry, Global Executive, Online Games &amp;amp; DCC.
We’ll ignore the others and focus on some very, very interesting things Mr. Koster mentioned, I highly recommend you jump the link and just read his section.
A bit on pathfinding:</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/06/1652245&amp;tid=209&amp;tid=136">Via Slashdot</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://plaguelands.com/?p=118">Plaguelands has a summary up</a> of the recent MMO roundtable hosted by IBM. Game Developers participating included Geoff Heath, CEO, NCsoft Europe &amp; Steven Reid, NCsoft Europe; Raph Koster, Sony; and Patty Fry, Global Executive, Online Games &amp; DCC.</p>
<p>We’ll ignore the others and focus on some very, very interesting things Mr. Koster mentioned, I highly recommend you jump the link and just read his section.</p>
<p>A bit on pathfinding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the tech aspect, something I didn’t know Koster mentions is that 40% of the cpu processing is utilized on pathfinding. Yes, fuckin’ pathfinding. A fuckin’ decade, and almost half of the potential processing powers developers are allocated is used to fuckin’ pathfinding. And you know what? Pathfinding is a joke, it could use a lot of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And databases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Koster also delves into some details about mmos and their databases. The runtime database and the static game database and explaining their differences and how and what needs to be done so developers will have the hardware that allows for more dynamisms, more impact, making that world a virtual living breathing world in itself that players can impact and not just some static sandbox. It’s funny when Raph talks about players having an impact on the world and how we are seeing somewhat of a reversal instead of progressing. Notice how games like WoW do not allow players to drop items on the ground? While this may save a lot of CS headaches, this is the type of simple impact on the persistent world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who thinks about these things? Everyone wants to be a developer or a producer, and never thinks about what the programmers have to go through. Fascinating.</p>

            <description>Seems since I did the security update late last week, that one of the fixes changed the permissions on the file that controls the comments, so it errored out and wasn’t accepting comments.
That’s now fixed. For the record, the error was:
Warning: comments_template (wp-content/themes/default/comments.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in (wp-includes/comment-functions.php on line 28)
According to the to the fix on the WordPress Codex it required adding a line to the style.</description>

<p>That’s now fixed. For the record, the error was:</p>
<p><code>Warning: comments_template (wp-content/themes/default/comments.php):  failed to open stream: No such file or directory in (wp-includes/comment-functions.php on line 28)</code></p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/35638#post-216293">to the fix on the WordPress Codex</a> it required adding a line to the style.css sheet of a theme so it looked like:</p>
<p><code>/*&lt;br /&gt; Template: mad1&lt;br /&gt; Theme Name: No Named Art Seed</code></p>
<p>However, that didn’t work for me.</p>
<p>SSH’ing in, and going to my wp-content directory and typing:</p>
<p><code>chmod -R 755 themes/</code> however did work. I don’t know if it’s a permission error on the comments file itself, or the directories, but comments are back.</p>
<p>In related news, I’ve come across some of last years digital photo’s and am in the process of uploading them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, including the ones from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/sets/544446/">Packer Training Camp</a> last year. So some of the timelines will be out of date for a few days, as I upload them and I’ll finish ’em off with this past weekends Fourth of July photo’s to back in to real-time.</p>
<p>My favorite Packer photo is Robert Ferguson making a spectacular one-handed catch at full extension in the air:</p>

            <description>Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails gets it. It being the remix culture.
Mr. Reznor has released the second single, Only to be remixed. The Hand That Feeds was the first single released, in Garage Band format only at the time.
This time around, it’s been released in 4 different file formats, including Acid Express and Garage Band so Windows users have a shot at remixing this time. I have a copy of the former around somewhere, and the latter on my Mini.</description>

<p>It’s very cool of NIN to give back to the community. I downloaded a few of the remixes for <em>The Hand That Feeds</em> last time, and some were pretty good.</p>

            <description>I remember when the Lego Star Destroyer came out in Christmas of 2002. I begged my wife for one for Christmas. At $300, it was the biggest Lego set to ever be released at over 3000 pieces. I had a vision of assembling it and never taking it apart and setting it on a pedestal…somewhere.
Alas, I never did get one.
Via Wonderland, an old blog post but a good one.</description>

It’s a classic blog post from Jan. of ’03. <a href="http://crystaltips.typepad.com/wonderland/">Alice</a> is right, someone desperately needs to put that to music.

            <description>I live about 35 minutes from downtown Minneapolis, pretty far out in the suburbs, in a town of just under 20,000 people called Chaska.
As I’m driving back from dropping the dog off at the kennel (which is really far out there), I see a billboard just outside the Chaska limits for an upcoming GI Joe toy convention in downtown Minneapolis.
Now, I don’t know if they did any market research about who exactly lives in Chaska, or just couldn’t afford a real billboard closer to downtown, say on a busy highway, but I can’t believe that that billboard is going to be effective at all.</description>

            <description>How cool is this – the Burn It club?
I came across Kymberlie McGuire via her Flickr site.
The Burn It Club looks very cool – every quarter she picks a theme, past themes have included driving music, remixes, and school, and you email her to join a group. She puts you in a group of 4, and you make 5 mix CDs (all different artists and songs, just follow the theme), one to keep, one to send to Kymberlie and each person in your group, and you get one in return.</description>

            <description>I’m cursed I tell you, cursed.
It’s a well known fact in my circle of friends not to let me build PCs. Something always seems to happen. I’d guess I have about a 30-35% success rate on the first try that PC’s I build work.
One of my major goals this week on vacation was to rebuild a few machines, including:
 My server Athlon 64 box Music backup box which (I think) had a bad video card Rebuild my wireless network, including my wife’s laptop with a MIMO card  Well, I’ve had a 25% success rate this week.</description>

<p>It’s a well known fact in my circle of friends not to let me build PCs. Something always seems to happen. I’d guess I have about a 30-35% success rate on the first try that PC’s I build work.</p>
<p>One of my major goals this week on vacation was to rebuild a few machines, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>My server</li>
<li>Athlon 64 box</li>
<li>Music backup box which (I think) had a bad video card</li>
<li>Rebuild my wireless network, including my wife’s laptop with a MIMO card</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, I’ve had a 25% success rate this week. Some vacation.</p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<p><em>The server</em>: I’ve watched the server die a slow death all week. From the first hard drive failure 6 months ago, I’ve seen the CMOS reset, the BIOS reset a few times, and now booting from the DVD drive isn’t working. I looked into buying a 1U rackmount server today to replace it, but can’t seem to get wife approval yet.</p>
<p><em>Athlon 64</em>: Swapped out processors and video card (got a sweet deal on a 6800 OC), now getting a 25 or 52 error on the Abit uGuru machine. Need to take the memory out and troubleshoot. Figures.</p>
<p><em>Music backup box</em>: Success! Swapped out video cards (took the 4200 out of the Athlon 64 since it got a 6800) and bam, no more lockups. Yay.</p>
<p><em>Wireless Network &amp; Kelly’s laptop</em>: Success and then <strong>oops</strong>. Wireless network swapped out, got WEP up and running, and went to install the MIMO card in Kelly’s laptop (my old one). Followed directions, installed the drivers first, then put the card in the PCMCIA slot, and the card wouldn’t power on or be recognized. Very weird, as especially for the last year I had been running an Atheros card in that laptop when it had been running Linux as Broadcom built-in wireless sucks. Flashed the bios, and bam, machine won’t power on. HP told me to take it in for service. Wife not happy with me at all, as she wanted it on our trip home this weekend.</p>
<p>Success rate this week: 25%. To top it all off, I had powered off my desktop to do some cable management, and when I powered it on to go to HP’s site for support, I got 2 non-system disk errors. Was reaching for a LiveCD when I rebooted one mroe time and it came on. I was pretty livid at that point.</p>
<p>Moral of the story? Don’t let me touch your PC. Ever.</p>

            <description>Sheesh, I mention the other day how I’ve gotten in to podcasting in a big way, and then Apple goes and makes it mainstream just to copy me (no, really!).
Apple’s iTunes 4.9 now has Podcasting support. Windows users can download Apple’s iTunes 4.9 here. Suppose I should fire up the old Mac Mini and take a look.
And for the record, I’ve been downloading podcasts for the last year intermittently, and burning them to CD for long car rides.</description>

            <description>The verdict is in this morning and the Supreme Court has ruled against Grokster in MGM vs. Grokster.
Here’s a couple of key points from the article:
 The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that companies that sell file-sharing software can be held liable for copyright infringement.
 (Emphasis mine) – Companies that market and sell P2P software for the sole purpose of infrigmenent is what the court is saying.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/06/27/technology/grokster/index.htm">verdict is in this morning</a> and the Supreme Court has ruled against Grokster in <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/27/BUGISDEKVB1.DTL">MGM vs. Grokster</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a couple of key points from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that <em>companies that sell</em> file-sharing software can be held liable for copyright infringement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine) – Companies that market and sell P2P software for the sole purpose of infrigmenent is what the court is saying. Software such as bittorrent – which was developed to transfer large files such as movie trailers and linux distributions – wouldn’t be an issue. That, and bittorrent is free.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright … is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties using the device, regardless of the device’s lawful uses,” Justice David Souter wrote in the ruling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court has remanded the case back to the lower court that originally ruled for Grokster.</p>
<p>The good news is that 1984’s Betamax ruling is still law. Devices made, that could infringe, can still be made. What the court has said is don’t create a device and market to the fact that it’s only made to infringe copyright. The bad news is, that burden of proof is now on the manufacturer’s to prove that they didn’t create and/or market to the fact that a device can infringe.</p>
<p>It’s not over yet. I’ll update the post when the EFF gets their opinion up.</p>

            <description>John Battelle’s blog has the whole story:
 I’ve confirmed that Monday Google will launch an in-browser video playback feature based on the open source VLC media player. This is the logical next step for Google’s video search and upload function, which began taking uploads from anyone who cared to submit back in April.
Google will not disclose the raw numbers of videos that have been uploaded to date, but the company will make all those which were tagged as “free” available for real time streaming through the VLC player, which Google has modified and will make available for download Monday morning.</description>

</blockquote>
<p>This is big. Mr. Battelle goes on to theorize that this is a shot against Microsoft in the coming war as Windows Media Player is a stand-alone app with it’s own DRM issues.</p>
<p>VLC is a pretty cool project. I’ve been using it on Linux and Windows since January when <a href="http://www.mpr.org/thecurrent">The Current</a> launched so I could listen to the AACPlus feed. VLC does it all – video, music, streaming, server, it’s a pretty amazing piece of software and it will be very interesting to see what Google has done to it and how it continues to evolve.</p>

            <description>I had a really tough time last weekend trying to get Monopod 0.2 to work, and this is 0.3 (I had to install a bunch of dev stuff). iPodder was ok, it’s the latest release that came out this week, but you have to chmod one file before it will work.
My two favorite podcasts so far are:
Acts of Volition and MAKE Magazine’s Podcast.
More to come, and a rant about my MP3 player.</description>

It has to be seen to be believed. Disassemble your laptop, mount it to a picture frame, and just follow the step by step instructions.
Think about it if he wasn’t using XP: you could take some really, really old laptops that can be had cheap and do a bunch of them using say, free software like Linux. 🙂</description>

            <description>My new favorite magazine and website is brought to you by the geniuses behind Make Magazine.
From their website:
 The first magazine devoted to digital projects, hardware hacks, and D.I.Y. inspiration.
 It’s like Popular Science was, except for the 21st century.
The MAKE Blog is fantastic, updated often with lots of DIY tricks and links.
I even downloaded two of their Podcasts last week, and those were pretty good too.</description>

            <description>I came home today to my desktop looking like this (look at the top panel):

You can’t even tell there is a panel there in the screenshot, click for full view.
A normal panel should look like:

I unlocked the Firefox icon so I was able to move it around, I moved the panel to the side just to check, I added a new panel to the top and clicked properties, but no joy on re-adding the Applications / Places / System drop down menus.</description>

<p>I unlocked the Firefox icon so I was able to move it around, I moved the panel to the side just to check, I added a new panel to the top and clicked properties, but no joy on re-adding the Applications / Places / System drop down menus. I’ve played with the menu settings, and you can add specific programs to the panel, but I haven’t found the menu settings.</p>
<p>I’ll have to reach out to the Ubuntu community and figure this one out. Gotta love that a 1 year old can remove it with a few clicks, and it stumps me.</p>
<p><em>Update about 5 minutes later</em>: To reinforce the discussion Novell gave at the recent GUADEC, there are some usability issues in GNOME, this being one of them. Right click on the panel, click add to panel and choose “Menu Bar – a custom menu bar”. What’s so custom about it? It’s the default panel menu option in GNOME – it’s not custom at all.</p>
<p>At least it’s back.</p>

            <description>Mac Daily News is reporting that OS X for x86 is available on P2P networks after someone took the developer version and seeded it.
Supposedly, it will work on any Intel processor, and the iLife applications are already compiled for x86. Mac Daily News goes on to theorize that Apple knew exactly what it was doing when it offered the developer edition after watching Tiger burn up the p2p circuit. The theory is Apple is offering a try before you buy scenario for OS X right now.</description>

            <description>Some people just don’t get it, and Jack Valenti is one of them. The former head of the Motion Picture Assoc. of America, his voice is still heard in Hollywood as an advocate against movie piracy.
We all know who this is: in the early 80’s, he’s the one who predicted doom for the movie industry if the VCR was allowed to be legal – and we all know how that turned out for the movie industry – 20 years later 40% of their revenues are from DVD.</description>

<p><a href="http://www.darknet.com/2005/06/interview_jack_.html">In a recent interview</a> Mr. Valenti has many choice quotes of how he still doesn’t get it. Locking content to protect against “piracy” isn’t the answer. Embrace technology, share, and don’t get in the way of innovation and let people use their legally bought content how they want to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I’d like to ask one question about the DMCA, and its effect on home moviemaking for personal use: Let’s say a homeowner is making an amateur video using video footage of his son playing pee-wee football. To jazz it up, he buys a copy of the movie Rudy and uses the De CSS program to strip it of its copy protection—</strong></p>
<p>[Jack Valenti:]Well, then he’s committing a violation of federal law.</p>
<p><strong>So if he wants to add a few seconds of crowd shots to the final version of the new home video he’s creating—</strong></p>
<p>[Jack Valenti:]He should go to the company that owns the movie and get permission to do it. If you start that, where does it end? How much is a little snippet? Is it 10 seconds? Ten minutes? Thirty minutes? He might want the first 23 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, or all of Gene Kelly’s Singin’ in the Rain. Once people have the power to do a snippet, they could do a whole movie.</p>
<p><strong>So you’re suggesting there is no fair use right to a few seconds?</strong></p>
<p>[Jack Valenti:]There is no fair use to take something that doesn’t belong to you. That’s not fair use. If you’re a professor in a classroom, you show Singin’ in the Rain to your class. You can fast forward it, and there’s no performance fee for that. That’s fair use. Now, fair use is not in the law. People are taking fair use and changing it to unfair use and claiming that it’s fair use.</p>

            <description>I’ve had a Mac Mini for the last week. I am ecstatic about getting it for a couple of reasons:
  Mac OS X is the only operating system I don’t own.
  Max OS X is based on Unix, and I’m a big Linux guy.
  Finder’s new functionality in Tiger is supposed to be similar to Beagle.
  PowerPC processor – again, only processor architecture I don’t own (Pentium 4, AMD, AMD64).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve had a Mac Mini for the last week. I am ecstatic about getting it for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mac OS X is the only operating system I don’t own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max OS X is based on Unix, and I’m a big Linux guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finder’s new functionality in Tiger is supposed to be similar to <a href="http://beaglewiki.org/Main_Page">Beagle.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PowerPC processor – again, only processor architecture I don’t own (Pentium 4, AMD, AMD64).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, so I’m bragging a little bit, but I’ve wanted a Mac for a long time, and they’ve just been too darn expensive. Even the Mac Mini I customized on Apple.com when they came out for over a $1000 (this one was a gift, it’s the entry level one).</p>
<p>Initial thoughts: Mac OS X is as well done as everyone says. It’s polished, the bundle iLife applications are very good, and the OS is very intuitive. It has it’s quirks – I still haven’t found where to launch Dashboard and play with the desktop widgets. I’ve looked in the software folder, I’ve looked in the dock, and I’m stumped.</p>
<p>The form factor is awesome. This thing is about 20% smaller than I really expected it to be. It’s just so darn <em>cute</em>.</p>
<p>The bad: The entry level Mac Mini is way too damn slow. 256 megs in a modern day operating system just doesn’t cut it. It feels sluggish. And for a real kick in the teeth, the Apple store offered to upgrade it to 512 megs for $150 with free installation. $150 for 512 meg DDR 333 stick? I can go to the local Best Buy store and get a 512 stick for $30-$40 on ad and have the Geek Squad install it for $30. I didn’t even bother to ask Apple how much 1 gig is.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty impressed. The tiny, tiny footprint of the machine combined with a well done operating system bodes well for Apple as they switch to Intel over the next two years. I still won’t switch from Linux though.</p>

            <description>As I blogged the other day, talking to a cow-orker in the know, Kelsey Grammar will be playing Beast in the upcoming X-men 3 movie.
My cow-orker is pretty excited about it as he thinks it’s the perfect role. I can see it – he has the speech mannerisms down to play a smart scientist. He and I share the same concerns about Bret Ratner directing though.
Jeffrey Wells’ Hollywood Elsewhere column had a brief mention of Ratner taking over in his “Wired” blog like piece on the front page, seperate from the stories he writes, that’s pretty harsh as well:</description>

<blockquote>
<p>06/ 9/2005 5:53 AM</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The fanboy community freaked last week when 20th Century Fox announced their decision to hire Breet Ratner to direct X-Men 3. Ratner will of course degrade the franchise. Not in any thuddingly obvious way but in a hundred little ways. One of these is his decision to add more laughs. “Not jokes for the sake of jokes,” Ratner said in a recent interview, but “jokes that come from character humor, that come from characters and that come from the situations.” This sounds to me like a guy saying he doesn’t entirely get (much less get off on) the X-Men mythology or metaphor, and that he’s a tiny bit bored by it so why not throw in some more gags? As Red Dragon was to Silence of the Lambs, X-Men 3…we know how this sentence ends, dont we? X-Men 3 will begin shooting in Vancouver in mid-August.</p>

            <description>Icculus sums up similar thoughts to mine on Apple picking up Intel much better than I can.
He’s 100% right when it comes to gaming. And that’s me saying that after making the switch to Linux 100% this week (more on that later).</description>

            <description>I figured out what’s been bothering me about Episode III. For as much as I love it, it’s Padme’s role that bothers me. In Episode I, Queen Amidala was portrayed as a strong character, who loved her planet, and fought the evils of the Trade Federation’s invasion. In Episode II, she was again a strong character as a Senator, trying to keep the Republic together when the Separtists threatened to destroy it.</description>

In Episode II, she was again a strong character as a Senator, trying to keep the Republic together when the Separtists threatened to destroy it.</p>
<p>In Episode III, her role is to be in love with Anakin. She’s not shown as a strong political figure anymore, just as someone who questions what side she’s on. Her love for Anakin is the major plot line, and she’s, at best, a secondary character relegated to worrying, instead of taking action like she did in the first two movies, whether it was traveling to Coruscant to defend Naboo, or going to rescue Obi-Wan in AOTC.</p>
<p>It’s too bad really – she’s much more emotive in this film, and for as good as an actor as she is, and her two awful performances in the first two (which I blame Lucas for more than her), it’s too bad too see her relegated to the sidelines in Episode III.</p>

            <description>Reading the news that Bret Ratner is taking over filming X3 (X-men 3), I did a double take when I saw:
 The original returning stars have been signed, and the cast is bolstered by Kelsey Grammer, Vinnie Jones and Maggie Grace (“Lost”), who just came aboard as new mutant characters. (As reported by VARIETY)
 Kelsey Grammer? Really? I have to assume he’s the villain – his over the top acting might work in that role.</description>

            <description>I went to my first Twin Cities Linux User Group meeting Saturday. I’ve been to a few of the installfests, but was always too lazy to go downtown for a meeting.
It was pretty cool – held in the Computer Science building of the U of M, Jeff Price from Novell gave a talk on everything Novell is doing around Suse. While vague at times, Jeff gave a very good overview of how the entire suite of Novell products (Suse Linux Enterprise Server, Novell Linux Desktop, etc) work together, how NLD9 is different than Suse Professional 9.</description>

<p>His tone was conversational, and he skipped the slideware, which was just fine. Good participation from the audience, including sidebars on HDTV and <a href="http://www.mythtv.org">MythTV</a>. I’ve volunteered to burn some copies of Suse 9.3 Pro, so I’ll definitely be at the next one.</p>

            <description>This weekend, I headed to downtown Minneapolis twice, which I rarely do.
Friday night I visited The Lounge, a bar in the Warehouse district to catch up with some work folk. This was one of the coolest bars I’ve been to in the Twin Cities. Before 10 or 11, they have a small area open near the front doors, with a bar, that turns into a bit of a dance floor later in the evening when it starts getting packed.</description>

<p>Friday night I visited <a href="http://www.theloungempls.com/">The Lounge</a>, a bar in the Warehouse district to catch up with some work folk. This was one of the coolest bars I’ve been to in the Twin Cities. Before 10 or 11, they have a small area open near the front doors, with a bar, that turns into a bit of a dance floor later in the evening when it starts getting packed.</p>
<p>We were in the Cathedral room, a private room in the back, that adjoins the larger dance area &amp; bar that opens after 11. The Catherdal room has faux stained glass ceilings, it’s own bar, DJ, and couches. The music was pumping, and a very good time was had.</p>
<p>Definitely worth a visit if you’ve never been there.</p>

            <description>It’s amazing the difference a year makes. Last year in 7-8 year old, most of the kids had a hard time paying attention, hitting, throwing. This year, even Alex, who I don’t practice with enough, has shown tremendous improvement in the skills department.
He has a fun time playing, and is lightyears ahead of where he was. Tuesday night, the night the picture was taken, he was 3 for 4, including the hit pictured here.</description>

            <description>I love GNOME. As I use Linux more and more these days (now averaging over 90%, the only exception these days seems to be some online music stuff), GNOME helps me do my stuff better.
Spent tonight catching up on GUADEC, the GNOME Users and Developers European Conference. All the hackers get together and listen to speeches, meet each other in person, and collaborate on GNOME.
Watched Miguel De Icaza’s keynote speech while reading a PDF document of the slides Glynn Foster presented on the 101 things to know about GNOME.</description>

<p>Spent tonight catching up on <a href="http://2005.guadec.org">GUADEC</a>, the GNOME Users and Developers European Conference. All the hackers get together and listen to speeches, meet each other in person, and collaborate on GNOME.</p>
<p>Watched <a href="http://stream.fluendo.com/archive/6uadec/Miguel_De_Icaza_-_Keynote.ogg">Miguel De Icaza’s keynote speech</a> while reading a <a href="http://http://mediacast.sun.com/share/calum/101_gnome_things.pdf">PDF document</a> of the slides <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~gman/blog/">Glynn Foster</a> presented on the 101 things to know about GNOME.</p>
<p>Miguel had some very interesting comments in his keynote about usability testing, and how users use a computer desktop. He threw out a challenge to the GNOME hackers, and it will be interesting to see over the 2.12 and 2.14 development cycles how the teams start to address usability, especially from a beginner standpoint. People who use GNOME every day, might miss some of the forest for the trees sometimes.</p>
<p>Glynn’s slides took me way back. It’s amazing to me now how long I’ve used GNOME on and off over the years. Going back to my first Red Hat Linux purchase (5.2) in January of 1997, where has the time gone. From the panel tiles, to Eazel, Helix, and how the look and feel has changed over the years to what I’m using today, it’s been revolutionary.</p>
<p>The donation is coming, it’s too bad the GNOME Foundation uses Paypal, as Paypal hates me. I have increased motivation to get my projects done around the house (music server, fixing 2 PCs, lots of cleaning and the basement) so I can dedicate some time to a GNOME project of some sort.</p>

            <title>Alias Season 4 Finale</title>

            <description>I’m finally caught up on my TiVo from all of my traveling, and I watched the Alias season finale last night.
With 5 minutes to go, I turned to Kelly and said last night that Alias had a strong ending to the season that started off horribly. I’ve talked about this enough already, and then they had to drop the cliff hanger to end the season.
Even with all the reboots, I thought this season had tightened up, with more attention to the characters in a smaller environment, better plot management, and tying up the Rambaldi plot line well.</description>

<p>With 5 minutes to go, I turned to Kelly and said last night that Alias had a strong ending to the season that started off horribly. I’ve <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=68">talked</a> <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=175">about</a> <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=180">this</a> <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=262">enough</a> already, and then they had to drop the cliff hanger to end the season.</p>
<p>Even with all the reboots, I thought this season had tightened up, with more attention to the characters in a smaller environment, better plot management, and tying up the Rambaldi plot line well. Even the plot throwbacks to the first two seasons, with the Helix Protocol and especially the Mueller device from Season 1 and tying that to the finale was well done for those that have stuck with the show all four years, and for those new to the show, it wasn’t overwhelming.</p>
<p>But taking Michael Vartan’s character, Vaughn, the one constant good guy through out all four years, who didn’t have an agenda, who was the steady rock in Sidney’s life, even when he was married in Season 3, and turning him into someone with an evil past – this is almost too much. Implying that he was a bad guy (a different branch of SD maybe?), and there was a reason he was made Sydney’s handler, and then the car crash to leave you hanging, what are we supposed to think? I’ve already suspended my disbelief that Vaughn made a transition from being a desk jockey, a handler, to field operations, and now the show is going to imply he’s a double agent, or at least an agent with a checkered past?</p>
<p>If it’s not one thing, it’s another with this show. With such a strong ending to the show this season and really getting the focus back, I’ll continue to watch. (Yeah, I’m a sucker).</p>

            <description>I came across this article on Dr. Who, which is a primer and brief history for those who never watched the show.
Dr. Who was was one of my first introductions to science fiction. Introduced to me by a friend in grade school in the 6th or 7th grade, I remember many a Saturday night watching it on our local PBS station. Channel 10 would broadcast the entire episode, usually 90 minutes, every Saturday night, and would start over from the first Doctor on when they reached the end of the current shows.</description>

<p>One of the biggest disappointments I remember was in 8th grade, and the 25th anniversary convention was being held in Milwaukee. We had tickets, and my buddy got bronchitis and was unable to go. A year or two later, our local PBS affiliate stopped showing it (if I remember correctly, it was one of the more expensive licensees for a PBS station) and I could catch in on cable on Channel 2, the PBS station out of Madison.</p>
<p>The 4th Doctor was by far the best. I was also a fan of the 6th Doctor, I thought he never got his fair shake, and the storylines with him on Gallifrey were well done.</p>
<p>I’ve Netflix’ed a few of the shows in the last couple of years (The 5 Doctors), and was taken aback at how campy it was, but it was still amusing. I still have a goal of buying The Key to Time episode arc, with the 4th Doctor and Romana, probably my favorite by far.</p>

            <description>I couldn’t agree more:
A Gamer’s Manifesto or 20 things Developers need to do now.
 Don’t use the online capability as an excuse to release broken games  The first time we hear the word “patch” in relation to a PS3 or XBox 360 game, we’re taking the console back to the store. Filled with our shit.
But surely the console industry, always more business savvy than their PC counterparts, will avoid making us gamers their unpaid beta testers.</description>

<p>And as Ms. Quindlen begins her closing paragraph, she sums it up well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the young men and women who began their college years in the shadow of September 11 graduate in its shadow as well. The intolerant, the monomaniacal, the zealots driven by religious certainty engineered the worst attack on American soil, and the result has been intolerance, monomania and zealotry driven by religious certainty.</p>

            <description>A bunch of good stuff this week:
Books:
 The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood. A cow-orker lent me this to read last week and it was fantastic. A must read, review coming soon. Survivor, Invisible Monsters, and Stranger than Fiction; all by Chuck Palahniuk. Author of Fight Club, Mr. Palahniuk’s writing style is very unique, and Stranger than Fiction are some non-fiction stories from his time on the road. A Spell for Chameleon, by Piers Anthony.</description>

<p>Books:</p>

<li>Survivor, Invisible Monsters, and Stranger than Fiction; all by Chuck Palahniuk. Author of Fight Club, Mr. Palahniuk’s writing style is very unique, and Stranger than Fiction are some non-fiction stories from his time on the road.</li>
<li>A Spell for Chameleon, by Piers Anthony. An author near and dear to my heart from my childhood. Last year I picked up the Incarnations series and Bio of a Space Tyrant series from my favorite used book store. A Spell For Chameleon is the first Xanth novel, published in 1977. I’m going to re-read it and see if Alex is ready for the series.</li>
</ul>
<p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gorillaz.com/">Gorillaz</a>, Demon Days: Special Editon. From one half of the team formerly known as Blur, Gorillaz’ Demon Days is a fantastic alternative rock album flavored with a bit of hip-hop.</li>
<li>Audioslave, Out of Exile. The sophomore effort from Chris Cornell and the former bandmembers of Rage Against The Machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Movies:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Good Company. Topher Grace is Dennis Quaid’s boss, and tries to date his employee’s daughter as well.</li>
<li>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Wes Anderson’s (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums) third film, with an ensemble cast. I think the Royal Tenenbaums was one of the final straws for my friends in movies I recommended and made them watch that they hated.</li>

            <description>I watched the Lost finale last night, including last weeks and this week’s 2 hour finale.
The finale was well done, I especially liked the multiple flashbacks for each character. Hurley continues to crack me up, and the show did a very good job tying the characters and stories together.
This website looks to continue the finale, and starts more questions than there are answers.</description>

            <description>I received a HP dv1000 as a gift from the Company last week, and quickly threw Ubuntu 5.04 on it.
It’s a gorgeous laptop – Centrino based, with an Intel 54g built in, built in 5 in 1 card reader, firewire, USB everywhere, and widescreen 1280×768 monitor. It’s pretty sexy for a notebook too, with a silver finish on the outside, and a shiny, glossy black finish on the inside.</description>

<p>It’s a gorgeous laptop – Centrino based, with an Intel 54g built in, built in 5 in 1 card reader, firewire, USB everywhere, and widescreen 1280×768 monitor. It’s pretty sexy for a notebook too, with a silver finish on the outside, and a shiny, glossy black finish on the inside.</p>
<p>Ubuntu worked great on it, other than the Centrino wireless, but Intel is starting to make a push in supporting Linux with their wireless cards. <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=26623&amp;highlight=ipw2200">Following the How-To on the Ubuntu Forums</a> helped, but it didn’t work until I changed my kernel from 2.6.10-5-386 to 2.6.10-5-686, and bam, everything worked.</p>
<p>Ubuntu works great on it, the card reader is supported, installation defaulted to the correct widescreen, DVD-RW, Synaptic touchpad worked, and battery life is excellent.</p>
<p>Need to throw some other applications on it before the weekend, including Tomboy, Bluefish, MP3, DVD playing, and Muine, and I’ll work on the blog layout while visiting the in-laws this weekend.</p>

            <description>I got home from Seattle Sunday around 3, played with the kids for a few hours, and headed out after dinner to watch Episode III.
It was easily the best of the prequels (which wasn’t hard to do), and I need to watch it a few more times, but my gut says it will come in at #3 out of the six in my list of favorites.
(Empire, New Hope (nothing beats the rush of the first one, though it’s a bit rough at times), Sith, Clones, Jedi, Phantom).</description>

<p>The lightsaber battles were fantasic, the pacing was well done, Anakin’s conversion and fall were well handled, and even Obi-Wan defeating Anakin was nicely done. I was disappointed with the de-emphasis of Padme, especially as she was such a strong character in the first two, the love scenes and dialogue was rough as usual, and it seemed to break continuity with two minor points. Other than that, it was excellent all around.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it, Lucas brought it to a fantastic finish.</p>
<p>And in other news, <a href="http://www.runleiarun.com/choppedoffhands/start.html">Lucas doesn’t like hands</a>.</p>

            <description>Trumping Microsoft in the aesthetics department, the Playstation3 was unveiled tonight.
Gorgeous, sleek design (with the exception of the controller, blech), in 3 colors, with more connectivity than you’d ever think you need: 6 USB, 3 Ethernet, 6 Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (for PSP!) and best of all…2 HD outputs.
Check it:
 Speaking of video, Sony Computer Entertainment’s Chief Technical Officer Masa Chatani was on hand to show off the PS3’s panoramic video functions.</description>

<p>Gorgeous, sleek design (with the exception of the controller, blech), in 3 colors, with more connectivity than you’d ever think you need: 6 USB, 3 Ethernet, 6 Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (for PSP!) and best of all…2 HD outputs.</p>
<p>Check it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of video, Sony Computer Entertainment’s Chief Technical Officer Masa Chatani was on hand to show off the PS3’s panoramic video functions. Since the console has two HD outputs, it is can be hooked up to two side-by-side HDTVs to projecting video in a 32:9 extra-widescreen format (think Cinemascope in your living room). Like a gigantic version of the Nitnendo DS, the dual digital outputs also allow for an extended game display, with the action on one screen and either game information or video chat on the second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With just a little less system memory than X-Box 360, and launching 4-6 months later, it will be interesting to see the big bad mega-corporations duke it out.</p>

            <description>Our Video Supervisor, Dave, made me this horse as a present, it was a hobby of his, when Alex was born.
Alex wasn’t a big rider, but Dave was one of the cooler guys I’ve worked with in all my time at retail. A bit older (especially older than me), he was one of the few that really made me feel welcome after we had moved cross country.
Zoe really likes to rock on the horse, as evident in the grin on her face.</description>

            <description>I came across a new theme yesterday, Relaxation, that adds a 3rd row as a Flickr badge of your latest photo’s.
I’ve decided to give up IE compatibility, and focus on Firefox. This theme, as well as a number of others I’ve played with, works fine in Firefox (go go standards) but not in IE.
I’m traveling later in the week, and getting a new laptop as well. Memorial Day I’ll be home in Wisconsin, and plan on coding the new theme’s CSS then.</description>

            <description>Trying to track down a track list for the copy of Liz Phair’s bootleg album, Girlysounds, I came across a local guy’s Liz Phair discography site. Probably the most complete site I’ve seen yet, if you’re a Liz Phair fan.
Unfortunately, my copy of Girlysounds doesn’t sync up with any of the ones he has listed, but he has all the lyrics linked in the songs, so should be able to figure it out, just have to take the time to listen to the album.</description>

            <description>HardOCP has the best X-Box 360 preview I’ve seen yet.
While I’m not a fan of the color or the aesthetics, I am very intrigued by the new X-Box Live features, and the rumors of Media Center integration. HardOCP’s article also touches on the ability to plug in a portable MP3 player or digital camera and stream content right to your TV through your X-Box – pretty cool stuff.</description>

            <description>There is a brouhaha stirring on Planet Gnome, the aggregator web site for the blogs of Gnome developers.
First of all, I’d like to say, I am not a programmer, I am only a user, and I choose to use Gnome as my desktop.
I will save for another post why I choose to use Gnome on Linux, but suffice to say, I’ve been using Linux and Gnome on and off for almost 8 years, and this last year or two, almost exclusively on my personal desktop, and longer than that on the my productivity box for email, IRC, IM and storage.</description>

<p>First of all, I’d like to say, <em>I am not a programmer</em>, I am only a <em>user</em>, and I choose to use Gnome as my desktop.</p>
<p>I will save for another post why I choose to use Gnome on Linux, but suffice to say, I’ve been using Linux and Gnome on and off for almost 8 years, and this last year or two, almost exclusively on my personal desktop, and longer than that on the my productivity box for email, IRC, IM and storage.</p>
<p>A little background: <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2005/04/29-gnome-no-fun/read">Edd Dumbill kicked off the conversation</a> a few weeks ago when he said his Gnome hacking had slowed because of lack of fun, and lack of direction of what language to code in within Gnome.</p>
<p>Everyone, including the big names like <a href="http://log.ometer.com/">Havoc</a> and <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/activity-log.php">Miguel</a> have weighed in, and there have been some really good points made about the different development languages (mostly Java vs Python vs Mono/C#).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.beatniksoftware.com/blog/index.php?p=18">Alex summed up what the major vendors will do</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Novell will continue to ship Mono because it has a vested interest in its perpetuation.</li>
<li>RedHat will continue to not ship it for the foreseeable future, because they have a vested interest in not being sued.</li>
<li>Ubuntu and everyone else will eventually include Mono because users want the apps.
And no matter what, the handful of apps I’ve half-started writing are all in C#.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://cipherfunk.org/diary/archives/monthly/2005-05.html#e2005-05-13T18_41_11.htm">Paul Drain summed it up the best</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but in the end:</p>
<ul>
<li>the end-user will eventually demand quality applications written in both of these languages on the desktop.
And that’s the key for me. I’m just as freaked out about the Microsoft patent issue in Mono / C# that could raise it’s ugly head some day. With that said, most of the coolest and innovative applications that are being written right now for the Gnome Desktop are in Mono / C#. From <a href="http://www.beatniksoftware.com/tomboy/index.html">Tomboy</a> for notes taking (and let me tell you: keeping track via Tomboy as I rip my CD collection with one note on missing discs, another note on scratched discs has been a lifesaver) to <a href="http://muine.gooeylinux.org/">Muine</a> for listening to music (It blows Rhythmbox away in my opinion) to <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/f-spot/">F-Spot</a> for managing and tagging photos. All of these applications are applications I use daily, and <em>just work</em>. (Thank you <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu</a> Universe repository). I look forward to using <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/beagle/">Beagle</a> in the future for desktop searching. In fact it was Beagle &amp; Dashboard a few years ago when <a href="http://nat.org/">Nat</a> was first brainstorming around Beagle that really grabbed me and sucked me back in to Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I want innovation in the desktop, and applications that just work. Those, combined with Gnome’s remote desktop features, (and my passion for free software development) keep me using Gnome every day.</p>

Blade I &amp;amp; II we’re good comic book adaptions of an interesting character. Not great movies per se, but good action, decent one lines, and interesting plots.

<p>Blade I &amp; II we’re good comic book adaptions of an interesting character. Not great movies per se, but good action, decent one lines, and interesting plots. All three were written by David Goyer, but with Guillermo del Toro, who directed the second one, moving on to Hellboy (and it’s sequel) they gave the director’s chair to Mr. Goyer. We’ll blame him for this horrible piece of work.</p>
<p>What did Blade III want to be? A horror film? Because the last half tried to do that. A hard-boiled mystery of what the vampires were up to? An action flick?</p>
<p>The only saving grace was Ryan Reynolds – his humor and lines were the one spark that kept the movie interesting. The only other things I appreciated were the nods to Blade II through the anatomy of “Dracula” and the vampire dogs, and some nods to past movies.</p>
<p>Other than that, the cinematography was horrible – the scene where Blade is on the roof chasing the baddie, and the camera pans (and later, they did a similar pan around Blade) was bad, the pacing of the movie, especially after the attack on the compound, and the dialogue was terrible. Early in the movie when Blade &amp; Whistler are talking before the FBI storms in, it’s as if Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson aren’t even trying – their acting is wooden and all the chemistry is gone.</p>
<p>And what happened to Parker Posey that she would sign up to do this? The indie flick queen of the 90’s is in this? What a waste of her talent.</p>
<p>If you appreciated Blade I &amp; II for what they were – mindless action movies with an interesting take on vampires, stay away from Blade III. Worse than the Matrix Trilogy, it will leave you with such a bad taste in your mouth you won’t want to watch the first two ever again either.</p>

            <description>This week’s purchases:
  DVD:
  The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (I dig Wes Anderson of Rushmore / Royal Tennenbaums directing fame)
  In Good Company
  Music:
  New Order: NO (Was out of stock last week, but they had it this week)
  Weezer: Make Believe (Great album, listened to it 3 times already – much more similar to their first disc, than their last disc, Maladroit)</description>

<p>Depeche Mode: The Singles (25-30 &amp; 31-36). Released a year or two ago, the follow-up to the box sets released 10 years ago. They have multiple (sometimes up to 7) versions of the same songs from their 7″ and 12″ singles releases, with unreleased remixes and live tracks. A must for the collector, though they break the bank. Unfortunately, I got home and realized I don’t have 19-24. Grrr.</p>

            <description>Ya know, I post this morning about the cool things Yahoo is doing in connecting their users, and how I think Google is doing more around services, and web services than around user inter-connection.
And then Google goes and acquires a company like Dodgeball just to prove me wrong. Ok, they’re not out to prove me wrong, but Dodgeball is the definition of a service that connects users.
If you haven’t heard of Dodgeball (they were getting a ton of press late last year) you need to check the link above and follow it to it’s home page.</description>

            <description>Via Slashdot:
Betanews has the story that Yahoo has launched their music service to compete with Napster &amp;amp; iTunes. Yahoo has quite an interesting strategy in the music business. With pricing 60% less than Napster &amp;amp; Rhapsody ($4.99 / mo with an annual fee), 79 cent downloads (99 cents if you’re not a monthly subscriber) (and at 192k WMA!), a media player that integrates with other Yahoo services with support for other formats, and support for Janus portable players just like Napster2Go.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/11/0114200&amp;tid=188&amp;tid=176&amp;tid=141">Via Slashdot</a>:</p>
<p>Betanews has the story that <a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Yahoo_Music_Service_Challenges_iTunes/1115769679">Yahoo has launched their music service to compete with Napster &amp; iTunes</a>.

<p>The first user post on the Betanews story, is a link to one of the developers’ blog, who has a <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-FDuiCSg4eqinB8z.GGJ7TmAz?p=89">ton of information on the Yahoo service and player</a>.</p>
<p>What’s interesting to me about Yahoo right now is their focus on their users. Including their acquisition of Flickr, the launch of Yahoo 360, and now music, they’re very focused on tying these services together, and user communication between members (look at your friends music list for suggestions, or Flickr tags and friends lists). While Google is focusing on web and desktop services applications, Yahoo is going in a different direction in creating communities, and <em>tools</em> for these communities to share and grow closer together.</p>
<p>Now if only their music engine / services worked on Linux…dammit, I’d buy music online if I could.</p>

            <description>I was disappointed to read in USA Today yesterday that ABC has pulled Eyes for Mays sweeps. I was really enjoying it, it had great humor, a good plot, and good pacing.
24 this season has been excellent. Instead of switching antagonists halfway through, they’ve done a good job with the plot and the focus on the current villian. The latest plot twist with China has been well done. Best of all, what they’ve done with Jack this season has really given me pause as you can see the stress of the job, the effect and toll it takes on his personal life, and how it effects him.</description>

<p>24 this season has been excellent. Instead of switching antagonists halfway through, they’ve done a good job with the plot and the focus on the current villian. The latest plot twist with China has been well done. Best of all, what they’ve done with Jack this season has really given me pause as you can see the stress of the job, the effect and toll it takes on his personal life, and how it effects him. I was surprised to read today that NBC is making a strong bid to steal 24 away from Fox next year.</p>
<p>I’m very impressed with Lost, which gives Desperate Housewives a run for it’s money as best new TV show this season. (Worst? American Dad). The plot has been very well done (how long can you have a show about plane crash survivors on an island?), and the way every charater is inter-connected is fascinating. With Lost, you have more questions than answers… (Though I do have some concerns with some of the rumors about casting changes for next season. They’ve focused on 14 of the 48 survivors this season, which gives them the ability to bring in other actors, but it will be interesting to see how the chemistry and the plots will work).</p>
<p>And damn Fox for yanking Arrested Development. Just like Alias, which we’ll get to in a second, the network needs to commit to the show, stick it in a time slot where it can be successful, and drive it. They also need to pick this show up for next season. The comedy in this show is one of a kind.</p>
<p>I’m glad Alias has found it’s viewers being after Lost. I’m all for what FOX &amp; ABC did with 24 and Alias respectively this year, in starting the seasons late, so they can show a new episode every week. With episodic shows like these, that have major plots that continue, breaking them up (like Lost or Desperate Housewives) sucks when you’re waiting a month at a time for new episodes. I was pretty skeptical with Alias at the beginning of the season as they rebooted…again, but Alias has really found it’s voice in the latter two thirds of the season. They’ve kept the Rambaldi stuff topical, Sidney’s sister hasn’t been a bad addition to the cast (not great, but done well), and they haven’t overplayed the Vaughn / his dad angle too much, while keeping Sloane and Jack in the mix as well. Kudos to JJ Abrams and ABC for a good job. It’s sucked me back in as I was about to give up on it.</p>
<p>And Desperate Housewives? I dig it, it’s a good solid soap opera, and I appreciate it for what it is.</p>
<p>Here’s to all the upcoming season finales!</p>

            <description>The music server is still coming along. I’m almost done ripping my CD collection, with less than 100 CDs to go. I have about 50 CDs I need to check the tags on that I ripped this weekend that I haven’t updated yet.
From there, I move them on to the backup box, get all the file directories set up correctly (that’s going to take a while), check all the tags one more time, and put them on the web server.</description>

<p>From there, I move them on to the backup box, get all the file directories set up correctly (that’s going to take a while), check all the tags one more time, and put them on the web server.</p>
<p>I’ve been ripping my CDs in <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu</a>, with the MP3 debs. Sound Juicer doesn’t have quality settings, so I used <a href="http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=531">GooBox</a> to rip to MP3 at 192k. I use <a href="http://easytag.sourceforge.net/">Easytag</a> to update the tags, specifically the year and genre. GooBox unfortunately doesn’t capture the year from CDDB when it rips, and the genre’s are never right.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, whether it’s my DVD-RW is too sensitive, the OS, or the application, some CDs won’t rip, even with minor scratches. Even after burning copies of the CD, and using the burn to attempt the rip, it was no joy. Using my Windows box, I used <a href="http://cdexos.sourceforge.net/">CDex</a> to rip, and didn’t have any issues, so I have a handful of those to rip as well.</p>
<p>The good news is I’m almost done. The bad news (for the music) is we completed the electrical in the basement this weekend (yay!). Once we pass inspection this week, then it’s a lot of manual labor to get all the insulation up in the ceiling. I’m in Seattle two weekends from now, so the goal is to get that all done this weekend. Fun.</p>

            <description>On Fri., May 6th, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled the FCC overstepped it’s bounds when it created the Broadcast Flag.
The EFF has the story, as well as CNet’s News.com.
This is big, very big. It was unexpected, especially a unanimous decision by the Court. Congress needs to legislate, not the FCC.

<p>This is big, very big. It was unexpected, especially a unanimous decision by the Court. Congress needs to legislate, not the FCC.</p>
<p>My favorite quote from the judges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You’re out there in the whole world, regulating. Are washing machines next?” asked Judge Harry Edwards. Quipped Judge David Sentelle: “You can’t regulate washing machines. You can’t rule the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s to all the groups that opposed the travesty that was the Broadcast Flag, from the EFF article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) joined Washington DC-based advocacy group Public Knowledge in fighting the rule in the courts, together with Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America, the American Library Association, the Association of Research Libraries, the American Association of Law Libraries, the Medical Library Association, and the Special Libraries Association. The coalition argued that the rule would interfere with the legitimate activities of technology innovators, librarians, archivists, and academics, and that the FCC exceeded its regulatory authority by imposing technological restrictions on what consumers can do with television shows after they receive them.</p>

</ul>
<p>The new Nine Inch Nails and Ben Folds are dual discs, with DVD content on the back of the disc. The Ben Folds dual disc has the entire album in 5.1 and some video content. We’ll see how good it is.</p>
<p>The new Mike Doughty album is <em>fantastic</em>. It’s been too many years since he’s made music, and 89.3 had him live last week acoustically so I got a preview then. The new album, produced by Dan Wilson of Semisonic, has blown me away. It’s much more emotional and raw than his previous work with Soul Coughing.</p>
<p>Next week: Weezer!</p>

            <description>My center channel on my receiver has stopped working for no apparent reason. I’ve swapped out speakers, cable, checked the connections and the settings, and all I get is warbly static out of my center.
No idea why it picked now to stop working. It’s 6 years old, and with the basement on the horizon, I really don’t feel like buying a new one for the living room.

            <description>Darth Vader Has a Blog! And it’s hilarious, here’s a snippet:
 20050418
  Haste Makes Waste
Bloody interrogation. Imperial audience. More leg woes.
Did you ever have one of those days?
It can be challenging to maintain your dignity as a dark tyrannical overlord when the circuitry in your left leg constantly misfires, threatening to send you off on a mad pirouette without notice. It requires a serious effort of will to maintain my poise, the tendrils of my connection to the Force reaching deep into space to feel out my distant quarry and at the same time wrapped around the mechanisms of my own body to keep them working.</description>

<p>Bloody interrogation. Imperial audience. More leg woes.</p>
<p>Did you ever have one of those days?</p>
<p>It can be challenging to maintain your dignity as a dark tyrannical overlord when the circuitry in your left leg constantly misfires, threatening to send you off on a mad pirouette without notice. It requires a serious effort of will to maintain my poise, the tendrils of my connection to the Force reaching deep into space to feel out my distant quarry and at the same time wrapped around the mechanisms of my own body to keep them working.</p>
<p>I am stretched too thin.</p>
<p>The traiterous dog Krelcon was captured early this morning and brought around to the Imperial palace after breakfast. I had poached eggs with ham, buttered crumpets and a glass of wetfruit juice.</p>
<p>During my interview with Krelcon he admitted to me that he had been involved in smuggling the stolen data tapes of the Death Star’s technical readout to the Rebel Alliance. In order to produce similarly fruitful results I used the Force to crush all of the small bones in his hands. Krelcon became most chatty then, and we discussed likely locations of the hidden rebel base.</p>
<p>Things went badly after that point, however. I confess that Krelcon took me off guard when he mentioned the prophecy. Eyes burning in a masque of pulp and blood he screamed, “The son of the suns is nigh, knight-bastard! He is on your very threshold!”</p>
<p>I had meant to backhand him but my passions were aroused and my concentration faltered, and so instead I released control of my errant left leg and instantly found myself doing a frenzied, lop-sided jig that turned me in place.</p>
<p>Krelcon found the strength to laugh. Thus, with one powerful thrust of the Force I burst his skull.</p>
<p>Which was probably premature. But que sera, sera.</p>

It’s a really good introduction and review of a linux distribution, and I thought his review was spot on.</description>

            <description>It’s here, a day early even. Here are some random thoughts &amp;amp; first impressions of the Dell 2405 24″ LCD Widescreen Monitor:
 It’s bright. Much brighter than the Sony 21″ CRTs I’ve been used to. It was a snap to set up physically. (Hmm, bad pun). Snap the base into the screen, and voila. The base is quite sturdy. I don’t think the cats jumping off the window ledge will knock it over.</description>

<li>It’s bright. Much brighter than the Sony 21″ CRTs I’ve been used to.</li>
<li>It was a snap to set up physically. (Hmm, bad pun). Snap the base into the screen, and voila.</li>
<li>The base is quite sturdy. I don’t think the cats jumping off the window ledge will knock it over.</li>
<li>Thanks to Bernd Paysan’s <a href="http://www.jwdt.com/~paysan/dell2405fpw.html">Dell 2405 web page</a> for the correct scanlines to use in Linux. (Courtesy of <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>).</li>
<li>1920×1200 resolution rocks.</li>
<li>I need to get a DVD playing ASAP. Just for kicks.</li>
<li>I’m not used to feeling like I’m sitting so far back, even though it’s just the monitor pushed back farther on the desk.</li>
<li>I’ll have to keep my desk clean now that I have all this extra space. (No, really).</li>
<li>I’ll be able to hear my speakers again as my monitor isn’t blocking them.</li>
<li>Coding web pages and stuff will be fun with multiple windows.</li>
<li>I can’t believe I bought something from Dell.</li>
<li>I can’t believe none of Dell’s competitors can compete. The nearest monitor even close to this was a Sony 24″ at $1800. Buying a Dell became a no brainer.</li>
<li>The 9 in one flash card reader is a very cool feature on the side of the monitor. And the 4 USB ports.</li>
<li>Even better, <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu</a> recognized them without any prompts.</li>
<li>Need to post the pictures. (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/sets/273635/">And done</a>)</li>
<li>No burned out / dead pixels</li>
<li>When scrolling this blog really fast, I get some motion blur on background on the far left, but you really have to look for it</li>
<li>UT2k4 in 1920×1200 is jaw droppingly gorgeous.</li>
<li>No noticeable motion blur in UT2k4. Get sucked right in and you dont’ even notice it’s an LCD anymore.</li>
<li>I should probably go boot into Windows and check performance. But I’m lazy.</li>
<li>Dell’s customer service still sucks. After the hard drive return process I went through last year, it’s not any better. The hoops I had to go through over the weekend, after I made the purchase, just to find out if it shipped with a DVI cable, were ludicrous.</li>
<li>It ships with a DVI cable, FYI</li>

            <description>Tonight, I learned all about LVM (Logical Volume Manager) on Linux. How to take 2 hard drives, and tell Linux to look at them as one drive / directory.
Nailed it on the second attempt. Might try it on the server later in the week.
For Wed: Learning rsync. Then I can do incremental backups from the server to my dedicated backup box via cron and never worry about my data again.</description>

If I’m clicking the link, I obviously want to go there. Don’t leave the current screen up.
All I do then, is shut the one that just popped up and open it in a new tab. But still, annoying.</description>

            <description>Re-ripping my CD collection for the 4th time in as many years, I’m reminded of all the great music I own, that I rarely listen to.
Having everything located on a central server you can stream from, either by artist or just random, let’s you hear things you haven’t heard in years.
I need to get the server back up. Soon.</description>

            <description>From all appearances, it’s anything but Time Warner vs. Comcast. From a business point of view, Comcast owns 22% of Time Warner. They’re jointly buying Adelphia together and splitting it up.
And that’s where it get’s ugly.
In doing the joint venture to buy the US’s 5th largest cable company (Adelphia), and divest Comcast of it’s 22% share of Time Warner, what they don’t tell you is they’re going to swap some markets around.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From all appearances, it’s anything <em>but</em> Time Warner vs. Comcast. From a business point of view, Comcast owns 22% of Time Warner. They’re jointly buying Adelphia together and splitting it up.</p>
<p>And that’s where it get’s ugly.</p>
<p>In doing the joint venture to buy the US’s 5th largest cable company (Adelphia), and divest Comcast of it’s 22% share of Time Warner, what they don’t tell you is they’re going to swap some markets around. The Star Tribune <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/535/5362049.html">has the story.</a></p>
<p>And one of those is here, the Twin Cities. Today, TW owns the South and West suburbs, as well as parts of Minneapolis. Comcast, through it’s purchase of AT&amp;T, owns St. Paul and the northern suburbs.</p>
<p>And a year from now, they’re gonig to trade a market. And Comcast gets the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>Which just plain sucks.</p>
<p>Financially, Comcast is going to raise my rates over 25%. But what chaps me is the level of service. Since Comcast bought AT&amp;T, who bought TCI, they’ve been upgrading those cable lines for years, and are almost done. Time Warner on the other hand, has had wonderful service for the last 5 years.</p>
<p>Comcast blocks ports, such as 80, so users can’t host different kinds of servers.</p>
<p>Time Warner not only doesn’t block them, but once every few months I get an email saying “Hey, we see you running an email server, so we scanned it, and it’s not a relay”. Even though it’s against the TOS for me to do so, they give me a heads up that they know, and continue to let me.</p>
<p>I’ll be honest – I’m not a big fan of Big Media companies, and Time Warner is one of the biggest. But their cable broadband service has been phenomenal. Few service outages, ok customer service, and the quality, including boosting from 3 to 5 megs down earlier this year, has kicked ass.</p>
<p>I am not looking forward to being a Comcast customer. They’re going to raise my price substantially, because I choose not to subscribe to TV service from them, they have antiquated cable systems, and are now going to try and merge someone else’s cable system in to theirs.</p>
<p>Great.</p>

            <description>Flickr continues to amaze me. What did they do this time? If you had previously bought a Pro account, they have announced Pro users have been given a another year for free, and 2 Pro accounts to give away to friends. In addition, normal Flickr users have had their bandwidth and photo’s doubled, and Pro users have had their bandwidth doubled, and the price of a Pro account is now almost half of what it was last year.</description>

            <description>So I leave for a business trip for a week, and halfway through I finally check the ‘net for news, and what do I see?
Jinzora and Netjuke are merging efforts to create an even better music management web tool.
While kind of cool, I’m glad to see the Jinzora team in firm control – their release cycle and active development is why so many Netjuke users have jumped ship from Netjuke to Jinzora.</description>

<p><a href="http://www.jinzora.com">Jinzora</a> and <a href="http://www.netjuke.org">Netjuke</a> are <a href="http://www.jinzora.com/pages.php?pn=overview&amp;sub=inthenews&amp;id=8">merging efforts</a> to create an even better music management web tool.</p>
<p>While kind of cool, I’m glad to see the Jinzora team in firm control – their release cycle and active development is why so many Netjuke users have jumped ship from Netjuke to Jinzora. Blake Waters, the lead developer of Netjuke, has been busy for the last 2 years on other projects, leading to Netjuke development stalling.</p>
<p>I’m glad Jinzora 2 has been released, and under the GPL. I have concerns about Netjuke’s future, as they wanted to get away from the GPL, and possibly even charge for the software. I’m hoping Jinzora stays on the path they have so far, and away from where Netjuke had thought about going. And Netjuke’s requirement for 2.0 for PHP5 was disconcerting – I understand wanting to use latest and greatest versions of software, but even Ubuntu doesn’t support PHP5 yet.</p>
<p>I look forward to the teams working together.</p>

For whatever reason, I thought it was the number of songs, leading me to believe the import process was missing tracks, though it would show the correct number of tracks imported.
Well, der. Jinzora was right.
I now return you to your scheduled programming while I rip my CD collection for the 4th time.</description>

<p>I now return you to your scheduled programming while I rip my CD collection for the 4th time.</p>

            <description>I’ve been playing with Jinzora this week, as you could see in the screenshot in my previous post.
I’m very impressed. I still have some glitches to work out – my ID3 tags don’t seem to be importing correctly, and I downloaded Easytag to check, and they looked right. A light bulb just went on, and I’ll have to check to see if it’s using id3v1, instead of version 2. I’m 99% positive all my tags are v2.</description>

<p>I really like the layout, it’s one of the best install routines I’ve ever seen, the album art it automatically grabs and puts up random is cool, and it does everything else. My only complaint, is that it doesn’t seem (and I’m new to this, could be wrong) a recursive file scan after the initial import to check for changes. One of the cooler things about Netjuke was I could update my ID3 tags, scan for changes, and it would fix it in the database. That, and the web pages seem to load slow, even on my local lan.</p>
<p>I’m slowly re-encoding all my CDs after the great hard drive crash of ’04, and doing it in MP3 this time, instead of Ogg. My new MP3 player cheats, and won’t do Ogg (though it does Napster2Go, but I’m not signing up for that).</p>

            <description>Could that be silwenae.net making a return? With the music server?
I have proof:

And it’s streaming music as we speak.
There’s some kinks to work out, so if you had access to the old music server, I have some things to fix first. But progress is being made!</description>

            <description>What’s on President Bush’s iPod, you might be wondering?
CNN is here to let you know.
 The playlist does reveal a rather narrow range of babyboomer tunes. Writing in the London Times, Caitlin Moran noted: “No black artists, no gay artists, no world music, only one woman, no genre less than 25 years old, and no Beatles.”
 Why am I not surprised?</description>

            <description>I’ve upgraded 3 of my main machines to Ubuntu 5.04, aka the Hoary Hedgehog release. The laptop went flawlessly, as did my gaming machine, which is installed on a second hard drive. Most impressively, the ATI binary drivers, with the change to X.org, stayed and worked on my gaming box automagically. OpenGL is beautiful, the fonts are beautiful, and I’ve switched to the Clearlooks theme from Industrial.
My two major complaints are the Industrial theme disappearing and they’ve changed Nautilus’ spatial nature.</description>

The laptop went flawlessly, as did my gaming machine, which is installed on a second hard drive. Most impressively, the ATI binary drivers, with the change to X.org, stayed and worked on my gaming box automagically. OpenGL is beautiful, the fonts are beautiful, and I’ve switched to the Clearlooks theme from Industrial.</p>
<p>My two major complaints are the Industrial theme disappearing and they’ve changed Nautilus’ spatial nature. Clearlooks is acceptable as a replacement, but I don’t understand why they’ve had to go and screw with Nautilus. Gnome’s default behavior for Nautilus is to open every window in a new window. <strong>I like it that way</strong>. Ubuntu, being a Gnome-centric distribution, and dedicated to releasing after every major Gnome release, should follow that direction. I can understand why some people don’t like it, but it strikes me as odd they’ve made this change.</p>
<p>Only the server is left to upgrade, and based on the 3 upgrades I’ve done from Warty to Hoary, should go flawless. Then it’s a matter of getting the server up on the network, which is a different story after my network rebuild last weekend.</p>

Xeni is pretty interesting. I’ve TiVo’d a few shows she’s been on as a guest, and listened to her on NPR, and her voice always strikes me as something I didn’t expect after seeing her picture.</description>

            <description>Ubuntu Linux 5.04 (Hoary Hedgehog release) is out!
Go download it!
Ubuntu has, by far, become my favorite linux distribution. Releasing stable version of Debian every 6 months, with the latest version of the Gnome desktop, an awesome user community, and a great selection of software.
The Hoary Hedgehog release adds X.org for the xserver, faster boot process, much better laptop support, and what I think may be a first for a Linux distribution, automated package manager download and installer to upgrade the OS.</description>

<p>The Hoary Hedgehog release adds X.org for the xserver, faster boot process, much better laptop support, and what I think may be a first for a Linux distribution, automated package manager download and installer to upgrade the OS. Check it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ubuntu 5.04 includes two new packages to help you keep your computer up to date: update-manager and upgrade-notifier. The Synaptic package manager also now includes support to upgrade your Ubuntu Distribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>update-manager is a package that allows you to quickly and efficiently upgrade your software in the background. The process is simple but without the fine-grained choices offered with the Synaptic package manager. The package is good for people who like the simplicity of a one-click upgrade, similar to that available in other operating systems.</p>

<p>I know what I’ll be doing this weekend: Upgrading 5 machines to Hoary, including my server. (My original plan was to get the server back up on the DMZ and get <a href="http://www.jinzora.com">Jinzora</a> working. Ack).</p>

I’m testing the equix theme, which I like as a light colored theme, though I’m still debating about going back to a dark theme. I don’t like the mouse cursor, and I don’t know why it doesn’t render correct in IE (damn work forcing my browser choice). It works fine in Firefox. I like it’s clean look though.</description>

Miguel de Icaza, of Gnome &amp;amp; Mono fame, recently reached out to Jon to create a pyMusique port to GTK# resulting in SharpeMusique.
It’s on my t0do list to download and try out. I’d give Apple’s iTMS a shot if it works.</description>

Well done.</description>

            <description>Slashdot linked to a story on Grimwell.com discussing WoW &amp;amp; MMO subscriber rates during launch and post-launch. It takes a look at where WoW falls post-launch within the MMO genre, and speculates about WoW’s longevity.
It’s a good article, but could have been harder hitting. I agree with the premise: WoW’s future is in question. When you consider WoW’s issues with new content, fast levelling to 60, catered to “casual” play, and lack of social interaction, how long will players stick with it?</description>

<p>Here’s a snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on past trends of similar styled games, World of Warcraft will not retain players the same way that Everquest and Final Fantasy XI have. I expect it will fall to somewhere between a half to a quarter of its current subscribers. This is ratio greater than that lost in Planetside and City of Heroes because I believe the “core following” is far less than the runaway success World of Warcraft has been would indicate.</p>

            <description>And so it begins. It took me 5 minutes to figure out why Planet Gnome was showing Planet KDE this morning, until I visited the Planet KDE site and it hit me that it was April Fool’s Day.
Davyd Madeley, a Gnome Developer has one of the funnier ones up that I’ve seen yet over the years. What if you had to continue to donate to use your desktop? Gives open source development a new lens.</description>

            <description>MGM vs. Grokster hit the Supreme Court Tuesday, and the Justices’ we’re asking the right questions:
 MGM and nearly a dozen other entertainment companies argued that peer-to-peer software manufacturers Grokster and StreamCast had built their businesses by distributing “infringing machines.” But counsel for the entertainment industry, Donald B. Verrilli Jr. of the law firm Jenner &amp;amp; Block, scarcely finished his opening statements before the Justices interrupted with pointed questions about how his arguments would impact technological innovation.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>MGM and nearly a dozen other entertainment companies argued that peer-to-peer software manufacturers Grokster and StreamCast had built their businesses by distributing “infringing machines.” But counsel for the entertainment industry, Donald B. Verrilli Jr. of the law firm Jenner &amp; Block, scarcely finished his opening statements before the Justices interrupted with pointed questions about how his arguments would impact technological innovation. Justice Antonin Scalia asked how the industry would protect nascent technologies from “out-of-the-box lawsuits,” and Justice Stephen Breyer pushed him to explain why MGM’s argument wouldn’t also apply to the iPod, Xerox machines, and even Gutenberg’s printing press.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I’m finding myself agreeing with Justice Scalia?? First time for everything).</p>
<p>Lots of folk’s turned out to wait in line to get tickets in to the Supreme Court Monday night. Luis Villa’s blog (a Gnome Developer) <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/index.cgi/343.html">has some great pictures up</a>, including demonstrators and <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/index.cgi/342.html">waiting in line</a>.</p>

            <description>So Apple has been in the news all week, as their DRM has been stripped – but what hasn’t necessarily been said is that is hasn’t been stripped, as as much as the Apple iTunes solution implemented on Linux doesn’t apply the DRM. Technically, it’s almost impossible to apply the DRM at the server level, and when pyMusique downloads a song on a Linux box, the DRM isn’t applied as it’s not a native iTMS client like on Windows or Mac.</description>

<p><a href="http://www.neowin.net/articles.php?action=more&amp;id=116">I whole heartedly agree with this interview</a> with Cody Brocious, one of the 3 developers of pyMusique (along with DVD Jon) on Linux. It’s not the DRM issue – it’s the fact, as a Linux user, I don’t have any options today to buy digital music on the platform I choose to use.</p>
<p>I’d accept their DRM if they supported Linux. No question.</p>
<p>I’ve used Napster and MusicNow – I’ve bought over 20 albums in the last 6 months online. We need a commerical Linux solution for digital music.</p>

            <description>My favorite photo-sharing site, Flickr was acquired by Yahoo this week.
The link to the Flickr Blog has some interesting Q&amp;amp;As about what it means.
While I’m nervous about it, I’m not worried. I hope what they’re saying is true that Flickr will influence Yahoo more than Yahoo influencing Flickr.
Flickr is great for a few reasons:
It’s completely built on Open Source software.
Flickr’s use of Creative Commons
Flickr’s use of social networking to tag photos.</description>

Billy “Wicked” Wilson, founder of Voodoo Extreme, as well as Gaming Groove, was known for his sense of humor he brought to the world of gaming news. At it’s height, Voodoo Extreme was one of the best web sites around to get information on 3d gaming, including games and hardware.</description>

<p>The blog entry on Wonderland is a transcript of a panel with Warren Spector (creator of Thief, System Shock, and Deus Ex), Brenda Laurel, Jason Della Rocca, and Chris Hecker. The panel was IGDA Session: Burning Down The House – Game Developers Rant. (Game Developers get to rant? Uh oh).</p>
<p>Warren Spector put it best (excerpt):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warren Spector:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First of all I don’t hate you, Will Wright. I just had one of those “I’m not worthy” moments in the elevator. YOU ARE the 800lb gorilla.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[argh what did Will SAY already? alice]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OK. I don’t feel very ranty actually. I tried to bail on this panel. But I have to say something so I want to say how this business is hopelessly broken. Haha. We’re doing pretty much everything wrong. This is at the root of much of what you’re gonna hear today. Games cost too much. They take too long to make. The whole concept of word of mouth, remember that? Holy cow it was nice.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart drives development decisions now. When publishers minimise risk by kow-towing to the retailers, you have a serious problem. When every game has to either be a blockbuster or a student film, we got a real problem. For my end of the game business all of our efforts are going into reaching a mainstream audience who may well even not be interested in what we do! My first game cost me 273,000 dollars. My next one is BLAH millions. How many of you work on games that make money? 4 out of 5 games lose money, according to one pundit who may be lying, admittedly. Can we do any worse if we just trusted the creative folks entirely instead of the publishers?</p>
<p>My point is coming. We’re the only medium that lacks an alternate distribution system. All we have is boxed games sold at retail. This is changing a little. But think about our competition for your entertainment dollar. First run, broadcast, reruns, DVDs.. you name it. hardback, paperback, e-book. Theatre release, pay-per-view, video, DVD. We put our thing on the shelf at Wal-Mart, it sells or it doesn’t, and OMG you just blew 10m dollars. The publishers not respecting developers, this is not the problem. We have a flawed distribution model. There are very few ways of getting a game done these days. Developers.. why should we get a huge return? We’re taking some of the risk, but the $10m, the marketing space, the retail space all belong to someone else. We have winner-take-all business that carries a lot of risk. So .. we have to find alternative sources of funding. Chris Crawford used to rant about how we need patrons.. I don’t care if it’s wealthy patrons, I don’t care what it IS, but it’s critical that we divorce funding from distribution.</p>
<p>We need alternative forms of distribution too. I’m not saying publishers suck, although I do believe that in many cases. [laughter] If the plane went down who would care about the marketing guys? We need another way of getting games out there and in players’ hands. If any of you bought half life 2 at Wal-Mart, please just leave the room. Has everyone bought Bioware’s online modules? JUST BUY THEM, OK, even if you don’t have the original games! We HAVE to get games into gamers’ hands. So I’m not saying publishers are evil.. if we do all this and go direct to our consumers with games funded some OTHER way than EA or whoever.. we’ll keep more of the money.. we have to find someone to pay for it and find a buyer after. We need Sundances. Independent Film Channel. Equivalents of those. Just try to find some way of funding your stuff that doesn’t come from a publisher.</p>
<p>The movies have this now: the studios don’t fund everything that happens out there. I’m not holding the movie business up as a model of great business practice, but you can get $ from a wide variety of sources. You know what, when the studio system was in place, that didn’t exist. Every creative person was owned by a studio. Cinemas were owned by studios. Content was limited. As soon as the supreme court stepped in and said no you can’t have development, distribution and retailing, everything changed. Now we have Bruckheimer, and Sideways. Sundance. Indies. At the very worst we need publishers to ask more than that one question: is this going to generate max profit. For most games this is NOT THE RIGHT QUESTION. Volkswagen owns rolls Royce, they understand the need for – oh the music’s running, I’m outta here. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brenda Laurel, on the panel (excerpt):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We model male ethos in the games we design: soldier, super athlete, criminal. Anyone who was born with internet and computers are prosocial. Skaters are mainstream. We have two models of alpha maleness: skaters and ballers [I have no idea what this is referring to – A]. … we need heroes, but what kind of heroes are we making? Where’s Malcolm X, or Chavez? There hasn’t been a game about geopolitics that was worth a shit since Hidden Agenda! We should be giving people rehearsals for citizenship and change. I have to tell you, Microsoft is the walking dead. DRM is a wet dream. It’s not gonna work! Cat’s out the bag! When this happens, you have to let the cards fly in the air and fall where they may. GIVE IT UP ABOUT DRM. GIVE IT UP ABOUT OWNERSHIP. Cleave to open source! A NEW ECONOMY IS COMING. As we become further connected we will find new economies emerging. We are the wellspring of popular culture. We have a responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Icculus links to this, and takes it a step farther in his current <a href="http://icculus.org/cgi-bin/finger/finger.pl?user=icculus">.plan</a> (<a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/misc/icculus-3-12-rant.txt">archived here locally</a> without permission)(excerpt):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spector is probably closest, though: the distribution model benefits the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>upper one percent at the cost of innovation, piracy, and well, the artists.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we can look at this from the music slant, Apple’s iTunes Music Store is a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>good start, but a shitty end. Eventually we’re probably going to need, uh,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>for lack of a better term, a distributed Steam…online, universal,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>incremental transfer of product without a centralized publisher. The problem</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>with Steam as it currently stands, among other complaints, is that Valve</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>escapes their oppressive publisher in order to become an oppressive publisher</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>themselves. Apple’s a little different in that they haven’t escaped the whims</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of the publishers at all (which is why every few months you see a Chicken</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Little article on Slashdot about iTMS raising their prices by a whole 20</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>cents…the poor consumers! Poor Apple! Why doesn’t anyone ever say “poor</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>musicians”?)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we can all sell online without a central authority, stream the bits right</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to the user any time of the day, and be the backup when their hard drive</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fails (which would be a nice feature in iTMS that Steam figured out, in case</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you’re listening, Apple), then we could ship when we’re ready, do things that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>are awesome without 150-man teams and millions of dollars, make more money</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>within a meritocracy, and not whore ourselves out to Big Publishing. Not to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>excuse them, but the fact that the EA Spouse blog exists says more about the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>industry as a whole than it says about Electronic Arts. I mean, it’s a safe</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bet to say that everyone outside of EA has an chilly familiarity with</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>those stories anyhow…put another way, when you see one cockroach, it’s a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>safe bet there’re hundreds more behind the walls.</p>
<p>There are no benign dictators in publishing. The only sane thing to do is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>flush them altogether.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A new era is coming, but the question is when. DRM isn’t the answer – show me one that worked yet. Open Source hasn’t worked in gaming (yet). Steam isn’t working (talk to someone who plays HL2 or CS:Source). Gaming is at a tipping point – the rise of independent creation and independent publishing combined with ubiquitous broadband and peer to peer technologies will create a new industry. Mods to current games, and publishers like Garage Games and things like Steam and Bittorrent are only the beginning as programmers throw off the shackles of Big Media.</p>
<p>I encourage you to read all of the articles in full.</p>

            <description>I’ve raved plenty in the past about Ubuntu, but finally had ran into a downer.
About 2 weeks ago, I did my normal apt-get upgrades to make sure Ubuntu had the latest and greatest updates, and the nvidia drivers were updated, but the kernel source didn’t map to the nvidia drivers as they should. Upon my first reboot a few days later after a power outage, the X server puked all over and wouldn’t load, so I was dropped to a command line.</description>

<p>About 2 weeks ago, I did my normal apt-get upgrades to make sure Ubuntu had the latest and greatest updates, and the nvidia drivers were updated, but the kernel source didn’t map to the nvidia drivers as they should. Upon my first reboot a few days later after a power outage, the X server puked all over and wouldn’t load, so I was dropped to a command line.</p>
<p>Edited the X server configuration, turned off the Nvidia drivers and just had the 2d drivers loaded, everything seemed ok, but it was kinda ugly. You get used to the prettiness of binary drivers after a while, especially screen savers.</p>
<p>Being the daring person I am, I decided to upgrade from Ubuntu Warty (stable) to Ubuntu Hoary, which will be released in April. Changed my apt sources list, apt-get, and voila – Hoary! Gnome 2.92, and a whole bunch of new updated applications. There were a few bugs, but nothing I couldn’t manage. The industrial theme was gone from gnome-themes-extras, mouse icons were old-school Gnome icons, not the pretty updated Ubuntu ones, and a few other things. A few days later, I apt-get update to patch to the latest, and reboot and the system pukes all over everything – can’t even get into the OS.</p>
<p>I swallowed hard, bit the bullet, and reformatted the drive. This time I used Hoary Array 4 to install, and was up and running. Installed Thunderbird instead of Evolution (different story there), and everything was very similar to how it was.</p>
<p>This morning I apt-get upgrade again, and rebooted accidentally (hit the power button instead of the CD-ROM open button, oops) and I get kernel panics.</p>
<p>Swearing in my head, I download the brand spanking new Hoary disc that came out one day after I downloaded the other, this one is an actual preview of the upcoming Hoary release, supposedly more stable than an actual testing release. The just released Gnome 2.10, a new background, bittorrent clients and other goodness. So far so good – it looks more polished than the last 2 test releases I had installed, the new system updater as a front-end to apt seperate from Synaptic works well.</p>
<p>Once again, I’m impressed. A few weeks to the actual stable release, let’s see if I can keep this one running this time.</p>

I still haven’t hacked at the blog, I’m waiting to see what the outcome of the current WordPress Theme Competition may yield as themes go.
I generally like the dark colors as it is now, but one column isn’t cutting it – I need to add back the second column for links and stuff.</description>

            <description>Looking through the referrer logs on silwenae.com last night, I was surprised to see all the hits I’ve received from Google.
Sure enough, I tested out the links, and searched a bit on Google, and then double checked this morning on a different browser and machine to make sure I’m not crazy.
Silwenae.com, home of our World of Warcraft guild, Apatheia, is currently the 10th search result on Google when you search for “WoW Guild”.</description>

<p>Searching for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=wow+screenshots">“wow screenshots”</a> results in the number <strong>two and three spots on Google</strong>.</p>
<p>Impressive. Google page rankings in search results are based on the number of people who link to you – and considering the search results for “wow screenshots” only has Blizzard above my website, that’s damn impressive.</p>
<p>Who knew I’d ever run a popular website after all the hobbyist versions I’ve had over the years?</p>

            <title>Volunteering at MPR</title>
            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2005/02/volunteering-at-mrp/</link>

            <description>About two weeks ago I received an email from Minnesota Public Radio that their annual winter fund raising drive was coming up, and a link to fill out a volunteer form to help answer phones during the pledge drive.
I had already pledged money to MPR to support 89.3, The Current, before the station even launched, in support of what they were doing. (See my other posts on The Current.)</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About two weeks ago I received an email from <a href="http://www.mpr.org">Minnesota Public Radio</a> that their annual winter fund raising drive was coming up, and a link to fill out a volunteer form to help answer phones during the pledge drive.</p>
<p>I had already pledged money to MPR to support 89.3, The Current, before the station even launched, in support of what they were doing. (See my <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=165">other</a> <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=181">posts</a> <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=182">on</a> <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=195">The Current</a>.)</p>
<p>So I decided what the heck, and filled out a volunteer form for the second day of the pledge drive, which was last Friday. Chose an early shift (5:45 a.m. to 9 am – ick) so I could get there, and still get some time in the office. I woke up about 45 minutes earlier than normal, and hopped in the car to St. Paul, an area of town I rarely go to. Security guard lets me in, I go up to the 4th floor, and I’ve missed about 2 minutes of the 10 minute orientation on the script, filling out the pledge form, etc.</p>
<p>It’s 6 a.m., and the phones are slow. In the room they had set up with the phone bank, they had about 30-40 phones in mini-cubicles for those filling out the pledge forms by hand, and about a dozen PCs for those that wanted to enter the pledge information on-line instead of filling out a sheet of paper (guess which one I picked). On two of the 4 walls, they had projectors set up. One showed the different promotional giveaways for different pledge amounts, by station. The other showed phone bank statistics, including number of volunteers on the phone, number of volunteers available to take a call, pledges taken, amount pledged and the goal.</p>
<p>Phone calls were slow coming in, but picked up around 7:45. Turns out that the heaviest times for call-ins are during the top of the hour (when the DJ’s are making the strongest pitch) and during corporate matching times, which 7:30 to 8 was one of. I’m guessing I answered maybe 20 calls, but I was floored at the number of calls for 89.3. Now most of them were calling to support <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/programs/morning_show/">The Morning Show</a> with Dale Connelly and Jim Ed Poole, and guessing from the voices, ages ranged all over.</p>
<p>I love 89.3, but I’m not into the Morning Show, yet. It’s almost too eclectic for me, and I’m not necessarily into all of the genres played, but I respect them for bringing all kinds of music to the radio. I’m ecstatic about the amount of support they received during the pledge drive though.</p>
<p>Overall, it was easy work, met some interesting people, and gave back to something I believe in. Giving money is one thing, but I’m glad I made the time investment. My wife has pledged to the news station on and off over the years, and when I mentioned I was going to volunteer, she mentioned it was something she always wished she had done. I was glad to do my part, as little as it was.</p>

            <description>A topic near and dear to my heart, which I’ve covered before, is the FCC &amp;amp; the Broadcast Flag.
The American Library Assoc. was in court this week, challenging the FCC on the legality of the Broadcast Flag. The 3 judge panel, while questioning if the ALA even has the right to bring a legal challenge, hammered the FCC on the FCC’s ability to mandate this without legislation from Congress. We’ll know the court’s ruling in a few months.</description>

I’ll try to get back in the swing of things, let’s see where we’ll start.</description>

            <description>Last night’s episode of the Simpsons was hilarious. After Bart single handedly ruins the tourism industry for Springfield, the city adopts gay marriage to fix the tourism problem. Homer quickly becomes a minister to profit from performing the marriage ceremonies.
At one point, the show flashes a URL on the screen, and sure enough, Fox &amp;amp; the Simpsons actually created a website: Springfield is for Gay Lovers of Marriage.
That, the subject matter of the show, combined with ripping on Fox for reality TV, had me rolling last night.</description>

            <description>I finished We the Media by Dan Gillmor last week on the flight to Atlanta.
It was a great book, and extremely topical at this time. Published last July, the book’s focus is grassroots journalism, through mainly, blogs. While the first third of the book is very high level, it’s a great starting point for folks who aren’t necessarily steeped in technology daily. The book shares some interesting history, just in the last few years, of how blogging and grassroots journalism can help hold Big Media accountable.</description>

<p>It also covered the ongoing fight around copyright, Big Media, with a focus on professional journalists and their role in the evolution of journalism.</p>
<p>Mr. Gillmor makes the point a few times that really sticks with me: most of the hundreds of thousands of blogs are too self-centered, nothing more than online journals. It’s those blogs that find a topic, and become experts through commentary, analysis, or news that really make a difference. And he’s right – those blogs I have bookmarked are exactly that, where my blog is nothing more than an online journal.</p>
<p>It was a very good book, easy to read, and the timing is definitely right. Mr. Gillmor has also released it under a <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> license, so you are free to read it on the web without having to buy it in a bookstore. That’s putting your money where your mouth is.</p>

            <description>WordPress 1.5 is officially out, so it’s a good thing I I downloaded a nightly build a week ago to play with it. I’ve updated the site accordingly, and downloaded a few themes to play with as well.
I like the black, but spent two hours playing with the header graphic in GIMP, and didn’t really get anywhere. I’m going to leave the black theme up for now to see how I really feel about it.</description>

            <description>So yesterday I’m talking about Napster, and what do I see on BoingBoing today but a link to a how-to on burning all of Napster – for free.
There I go again being ahead of the curve. But seriously, sign up for the Napster 14 day trial, download Winamp 5 and a couple of plugins, configure them, and stream the albums on Napster. The plugins will take the stream, and convert it to wav, which you then burn.</description>

            <description>Now it’s time to get some tinning done from the heating &amp;amp; cooling guys, finish off the electrical, get the insulation up and then have the drywallers in. Need to get it all done ASAP so we can get the drywallers in before the new housing construction season starts.
It was a good way to finish off a fairly lazy vacation with some good old-fashioned hard work.

            <description>Boing Boing links to a Washington Post review of Napster to Go. Let’s just say WaPo found it… wanting. Napster’s PR firm has been running full steam lately with numerous mentions in the press (after their post-Super Bowl Ad) where they’re trying to show the math hat an iPod with 10,000 songs = $10,000 or Napster can get you the same thing for $15 / month. That is, $15 / month for forever.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/13/napstertogo_reviewed.html">Boing Boing</a> links to a <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/washpost/20050213/tc_washpost/a18496_2005feb12">Washington Post review of Napster to Go.</a> Let’s just say WaPo found it… wanting. Napster’s PR firm has been running full steam lately with numerous mentions in the press (after their post-Super Bowl Ad) where they’re trying to show the math hat an iPod with 10,000 songs = $10,000 or Napster can get you the same thing for $15 / month. That is, $15 / month for <strong><em>forever</em></strong>. Because once you stop paying your songs go poof.</p>
<p>Now I have a friend, who shall remain nameless, that loves Napster for their streaming service. He’s had various MP3 players over the years, but they were clunky, so he bought an iPod mini mid-last year. Loved the Apple experience when it came to digital music – he’s fairly technical but Apple made it easy to get and transfer music. Yet he comes back to Napster to use their radio stations. For $10 bucks a month (or whatever it is, somewhere in that ballpark) you can listen to any song Napster has. You want to burn it? Just like iTunes, that’s 99 cents please. So Napster to Go will be the premium version of their monthly fee based service.</p>
<p>I can see both sides – if you have a Microsoft powered (codename Janus) player, or in Microsoft marketing speak, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/playsforsure/default.aspx">Plays for Sure</a>, Napster to Go can fill up your MP3 (or should I be saying WMA?) player until you stop paying for Napster. That’s pretty cool – I can get thousands of songs to go work out to, or listen to my car, my choice of songs, for $15 month. Compare that to Sirius or XM, and it could be a better option that satellite radio.</p>
<p>But on the on the other hand – <a href="http://www.craphound.com/msftdrm.txt">DRM makes bad business sense</a> as <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=169">I’ve noted before</a>. Think about it, as Xeni points out so eloquently on BoingBoing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if Napster To Go were Napster The Grocery, and milk you bought could only be consumed from proprietary square mugs (known for continually sprouting holes you have to patch on your own), and milk cartons vanish from your refrigerator shelf if you don’t re-up your subscription? You’d get milk elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>I’ll let you figure out the allegory on your own.</p>

            <description>ESPN.com – NBA – Stein: Spree, Sam sulk season away. Marc Stein is a wise man – and he’s absolutely right. In light of Flip’s firing today, I point you to this analysis that all T-wolves fans should be thankful that Spree rejected the Timberwolves contract extension offer (3 years, $21 meelion) and haven’t signed Sam to one.
I agree with his analysis that Sam &amp;amp; Spree are far more to blame for the lethargy of the team than Flip.</description>

<p>I agree with his analysis that Sam &amp; Spree are far more to blame for the lethargy of the team than Flip. Sure, Flip has given KG some latitude, and Flip’s bizaare substitions were questionable, but at least Flip was doing something to inject energy into the team.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see McHale coach the team – something he’s never done, but there is no questioning his breadth or knowledge of the game.</p>
<p>Here’s to a better second half.</p>

Just because I mentioned it in my last post. Had to be done!</description>

            <description>I installed Ubuntu on another computer today – my gaming box.
Threw in a 20 gig HD I had laying around, threw in the install disc, and 20 minutes later had a fully functioning dual-boot system.
This will enable me to get back to one of my goals – learning PHP and dedicating 2 nights a week to it. Pulled up synaptic, installed screem &amp;amp; bluefish, and I’m ready to go!</description>

<p>I even installed gnome-blog so I can blog to my hearts content right from my desktop.</p>
<p>In 20 minutes I had a fully functioning linux install, up to date with all security fixes, and patches necessary. Apt-get a few things, had MP3 working and I was surfing away.</p>
<p>My only 2 complaints: This brown theme does nothing for me, thoguh I love Gnome’s Industrial theme. And ran into my first major Ubuntu bug. I’m running an Intel 865 chipset board, using the onboard sound. Sound works in Gnome, but a few of the games I installed have no sound. Must be an ALSA / OSS thing. I tried installing a few ALSA plugins, but no luck yet. I’ll have to throw Doom3 or UT2k4 on here and see how it fares.</p>

            <description>I’ve upgraded the blog to WordPress 1.5 gamma. Used last night’s nightly build, and everything seems to work. There’s a few bugs in the admin section, but they’re just visual.
I’ll have to mess with the visual settings a little bit, the categories tree structure has been replaced by an alphabetical list which I don’t care for. Oddly enough, in the admin section it’s still in the tree form. Oh well.</description>

<p>Changed the theme. Was using Kubrick for WordPress 1.2 – and they made that the standard theme in 1.5! That just won’t do. So I downloaded ShadedGrey from <a href="http://wpthemes.info/topics/downloadable-theme/">WP-Themes.info</a>.</p>
<p>Will have to play around with it a bit more, but so far so good.</p>

            <description>I just finished Chuck Palahniuk breakthrough novel Fight Club. Yes, the novel that inspired the movie starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. (On a side note, I’ve mentioned to one of my friends that I don’t think Ed Norton has ever done a bad movie. Even that one with Robert DeNiro – not a good movie, but it had DeNiro.)
The book was amazing. It’s very short, just slightly longer than a novella.</description>

(On a side note, I’ve mentioned to one of my friends that I don’t think Ed Norton has ever done a bad movie. Even that one with Robert DeNiro – not a good movie, but it had <em>DeNiro</em>.)</p>
<p>The book was amazing. It’s very short, just slightly longer than a novella. The movie was surprisingly closer to the book than I expected, but the book’s ending was better. I can see why the movie couldn’t go that direction and applaud the way the movie did end in keeping with the spirit of the book.</p>
<p>I am Joe’s impressed reader.</p>
<p>The book makes you question everything – how you live, American consumerism, and what matters. The prose’s style is quick and captures you. You quickly overcome the quirkiness of the prose itself and have a hard time putting the book down.</p>
<p>The book has been on my want to read list for years, and my wife got it for me for Christmas. Now to collect the rest. Unfortunately, most of his books are trade paperbacks, and are fairly small, so paying $10-$14 is a bit much. I’ll have to check half.com to see if regular paperbacks were ever published.</p>

            <description>Vacation is half over and I haven’t done a damn thing. And I like it.
Lots of playing WoW, and I have worked on the server a bit (damn DHCP and firewall giving me errors).
I’ve also aggregated all of my music onto one machine, which will lead me to cleaning some hard drives and installing linux on one of my other PCs. That machine will have rsync automated to back up the master collection on the server so I won’t have to worry about another hard drive crash.</description>

            <description>From my parents, an authentic Favre jersey, autographed and framed, with a pigskin matte in the frame. It’s huge, the picture doesn’t do it justice.
Now to get the basement finished so I can build my shrine to the Packers.</description>

            <description>I’m consistently impressed with 89.3, KMCP, The Current. The music keeps getting better and better. I had some money left in my MusicNow account, so I took Mary Lucia’s advice and picked up Ted Leo &amp;amp; The Pharmacist’s Shake the Sheets. I had looked for it at Best Buy, but they had had only 2 of their older albums. I also picked up Tegan &amp;amp; Sara, a Canadian folk duo (sisters, I think) that have opened up for Sarah McLachlan a few times.</description>

I also picked up Tegan &amp; Sara, a Canadian folk duo (sisters, I think) that have opened up for Sarah McLachlan a few times.</p>
<p>Both discs were their newest releases from late in 2004, and both kick ass. Ted Leo reminds me of a fast driven Tim Mahoney, with a similar vocal style, but very different musically. Tegan &amp; Sara are impressive in their own way, with poppy, fast alternative.</p>
<p>About 2 weeks ago The Current started giving away bumper stickers one or two nights a week. Unfortunately, the volunteers were always in downtown St Paul or Minneapolis, or Uptown, and I live in the boonies in the suburbs. I was pleasantly suprised to get a letter from The Current yesterday with a thank you for donating, and one bumper sticker and 2 window clings, and a promise that my welcome kit would come in a month, and my vinyl record in a few more. Time to get a car wash, peel off my Kerry sticker, and replace it with something better.</p>

            <description>The big enchilada. The game they all play for. The Super Bowl.
I love football – it’s the one sport I have a passion for. While I hate baseball, hockey is ok (if they ever play), like NBA basketball, really like NCAA basketball and would put NCAA football a step above that, it’s NFL football I make a point of seeing week in and week out.
NFL Europe, training camps, I’ll do whatever I can to get my fix during the offseason.</description>

<p>I love football – it’s the one sport I have a passion for. While I hate baseball, hockey is ok (if they ever play), like NBA basketball, really like NCAA basketball and would put NCAA football a step above that, it’s NFL football I make a point of seeing week in and week out.</p>
<p>NFL Europe, training camps, I’ll do whatever I can to get my fix during the offseason.</p>
<p>And today is the day that all that hard work culminates in one game for the players.</p>
<p>But what drives me nuts about the Super Bowl is some of the hype (not all, but some). 8 hours of pre-game – 8 hours? Really? And after Janet Jackson last year, this year’s focus on being “tame” – and it’s just ridiculous. So it’s okay to have an erectile disfunction ad, but yet Fox changes the name of the <em>Best Damn Sports Show</em> to the <em>Best Darned Sportshow</em>? It’s ok for Mike Ditka to tell me about limp dicks but Fox yanks Mickey Rooney’s ass in a commercial spoof?</p>
<p>All ranting aside, here’s hoping to a close game like last year, some decent commercials, and good friends and food to watch the game with. (And go Pats!)</p>

I’ve tweaked the site a bit, and even before that, I’ve been lucky enough that none of the comment spam has gotten through yet.
It’s quite annoying to have it all sit in the moderation queue though.</description>

            <description>The New York Times has a decent article up about MythTV, the Broadcast Flag, and Filesharing up. While it’s fairly high level, and some parts are wrong (Bittorrent letting you download a 1 hour show in minutes for example: I’ve downloaded plenty of TV shows and it’s not that fast, trust me) it’s not a bad article.
Even mentions the EFF and how they’re going to fight the Broadcast Flag, which may or may not put a stop to some of the filesharing.</description>

<p>Even mentions the EFF and how they’re going to fight the Broadcast Flag, which may or may not put a stop to some of the filesharing. I agree with parts – I own Alias, 24, Sports Night, and every season of the Simpsons available on DVD. Purchased them and everything. I don’t mind buying TV I love (though it drives my wife crazy why I buy TV shows on DVD for shows I’ve already seen). But the government regulating even more the TV that comes over the air on what I can record, and how long it stays recorded for I start to have issues. It’s one thing if we’re talking about pay TV, say the Sopranos. But when I miss a week or two of 24, what is the issue if I download it?</p>
<p>If I miss an episode of 24, and I can’t download it, there is a good chance I am done watching for the season. Especially with serial shows like Lost, 24, Alias, and Desperate Housewives. Is it worth it to Big Media to not allow me to download and lose me as a customer for the entire season? I don’t think they always see the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>I’ll be buying a pcHDTV card for my MythTV box prior to July 1st when the Broadcast Flag goes in to effect. Maybe even two since hard drives are cheap now.</p>

<p>If you took the 100 worst ideas ever conceived for a science-fiction film, rattled them around in a Lotto tumbler and spilled them out onto the screen at random, you could not produce a more asinine hodgepodge than this.</p>

<p>How many people do you think will even read that review, much less go to that movie? That cracks me up, tell it like it is Star-Trib!</p>

            <description>Kento was the big winner last night in our first monthly poker tournament.
It was quite fun, we made a few mistakes here and there, and a few people bet big early to get out more than anything, but I think it’s safe to say a good time was had by all.
Liquor flowed freely, food was consumed, and money exchanged hands. How can it get any better! 🙂
I’ll do a recap of how I did later.</description>

<p>I’ll do a recap of how I did later. For now, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/sets/99705/">all the photo’s from Fri. night are here on my Flickr site</a>.</p>

Tonight starts our first, of monthly, poker tournaments with our little clique of friends. 8 guys, 2 of which whom know how to play Texas Hold ‘Em are gathering together.

            <description>John Hughes’ seminal teenage movie, The Breakfast Club, turns 20 next month. I stumbled across an article on the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel discussing the film’s anniversary. It briefly covers the movie, and also 5 things you might not know, 5 things that would be different, and 5 reasons why it’s still relevant.
The Breakfast Club still remains my favorite John Hughes movie, but Pretty in Pink has to be a close second.</description>

<p>The Breakfast Club still remains my favorite John Hughes movie, but Pretty in Pink has to be a close second. The Breakfast Club introduced us to the actors that become the Brat Pack in the late 80’s, and the view on high school it had in 1985 isn’t too different even 20 years later.</p>

            <description>The EFF has launched a new campaign: Endangered Gizmos. As Big Media threatens innovation, reverse engineering, and freedom of invention, the EFF has put up a list of Extinct technology (/wave Replay, DVD-X-Copy), Endangered (HDTV Tuners, Open WiFi hotspots, MP3 players), and products that have been Saved in the court system (from the Betamax which begat VHS which begat DVD to printer cartridges).
Each product carries a link to more information, whether it’s the HDTV Broadcast Flag, information on the court cases that have saved innovation, or the history of the product itself.</description>

            <description>I’ve been meaning to blog this all weekend, but I got distracted.
MPR has re-launched their website, replacing just the blog, including bios of the on-air talent, a feedback form, a FAQ, and donation information.
Speaking of donating, in the age of XM, Sirius, and Napster, when you can pay $10-$15 month for hundreds of stations, why donate? Because 89.3 is public radio, a community service, and is unlike and other radio station out there.</description>

Because 89.3 is public radio, a community service, and is unlike and other radio station out there. Where DJ’s control the playlists, not big media (yes, even XM has a significant Clear Channel stake), and 89.3 will also have a heavy local focus for Minnesota artists. I did my part, and put my money where my mouth is.</p>
<p>They will be streaming live, including Windows Media Player (more ick), and aacPlus, a fairly new MPEG-4 audio stream that supposedly has excellent quality at low bandwidth. <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">The open source VLC project</a> has a player available for Windows, Mac, and Linux that will stream aacPlus. I’ll be installing that this morning!.</p>
<p>Give it a try, and listen in.</p>

            <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2005/01/24-vs-alias/</link>

            <description>I recently blogged about Alias’ current reboot, and as I try and get caught up on my TiVo, I finally watched the two hour premier of 24.
Talk about how to reboot a show in two totally different ways. I’ve already complained about Alias and my inability to suspend my imagination about the reboot. 24 handled it the opposite – in less than 5 minutes they explained the changes in Jack’s life, made it believable, and then the action just grabbed you and didn’t let go for two hours.</description>

Sure, Jack becoming a temporary field agent stretches the imagination a bit, but no where near how Sydney’s working for Sloan again does.</p>
<p>I was very impressed with 24’s season premiere, and couldn’t stop watching. Where with Alias, I watched it, but I was just waiting for the next thing to happen.</p>
<p>The 3rd season of 24 might have been the weakest in some regards, but it was also better with how they kept the plot moving, 3 major plot shifts instead of 2 at the twelve hour mark, (which helps people watching for continuity’s sake). The 4th kicked off with a bang, and hasn’t let go yet.</p>
<p>I’ll continue to watch both shows, but for very different reasons.</p>

            <description>As seen on Slashdot, TiVo is in the news today, starting with a New York Times article (Registration required or visit Bugmenot that paints a bleak future for the company. With TiVo’s CEO promoted out of his job due to failing to close the Comcast deal, many talking heads on the ‘netare pointing to failed negotiation as sealing TiVo’s doom.

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/18/0125256&amp;tid=129&amp;tid=1">seen on Slashdot</a>, TiVo is in the news today, starting with a <a href="http://nytimes.com/2005/01/17/technology/17tivo.html">New York Times article</a> (Registration required or visit <a href="http://www.bugmenot.com">Bugmenot</a> that paints a bleak future for the company. With <a href="http://www.gigaom.com/2005/01/13/tivo-ceo-to-go/">TiVo’s CEO promoted out of his job</a> due to <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/01/tivo_walked_awa.html">failing to close the Comcast deal</a>, many <a href="http://www.gigaom.com/2005/01/17/tivo2doom/">talking heads on the ‘net</a>are pointing to failed negotiation as sealing TiVo’s doom. According to these news reports, TiVo was offered less than one dollar a month from Comcast to license the TiVo technology in Comacst set top boxes. This offer was less than what DirecTV was currently paying, but Comcast has twice as many subscribers – almost 40 million. And it was no secret that with Rupert Murdoch’s acquisition of DirecTV that DirecTV was looking at other PVR ideas than TiVO, which has since been announced.</p>
<p>My thoughts? I believe TiVo is the greatest device invented in the last 20 years, eclipsing DVD, CD, and MP3 players (sorry folks, the internet has been around a lot longer than 20 years). TiVo has changed the way I live my life and watch TV. The functionality and features are second to none, including the old Replay I own or any other PVR or Media Center PC I’ve seen. TiVo’s Season Pass functionality to record a show on any channel, by new, repeat or any and all, ranking of what shows to record when, quality, I could go on forever. I would hate to see this company go under, but they just haven’t struck the deals necessary to keep going. By building their own box, and getting away from relationships with Sony and Philips, limited functionality with the TiVo basic service in DVD recorders, and the DirecTV deal slipping away from them, the writing looks to be on the wall.</p>
<p>And this doesn’t even touch on what the Broadcast Flag going live on July 1st could do to their functionality moving forward. Sure, existing devices will be grandfathered in, but will Big Media try and hamstring them after July 1st? Things like the Strangeberry acquisition and TiVo2Go (burning your shows from your TiVo to your PC and sharing them) are steps in the right direction, but is it too little to late?</p>
<p>I know in the future as I move to finish my basement, I have a goal of building a Home Theater PC that will run <a href="http://www.mythtv.org">MythTV</a>, a Linux PVR solution that layers on top of an existing Linux installation. MythTV is in active developement, and with the inclusion of a Linux HDTV card on the market, I will have similar functionality to record DirecTV programming (except their HD signals) and off air HD. MythTV will allow me to save my television shows on one box, and stream to any other Linux PC in my home, say, my den, as I’m gaming. From there, I can easily edit and burn to DVD to archive shows or save on DVD if my HD starts to get full. It also has a series of modules so I can check the weather on my TV, stream my music from the HTPC or my server, rip and back up DVDs or CDs, the list goes on.</p>
<p>I love my TiVo, but I may have to plan for a day they are no longer around.</p>

            <description>Good football weekend. After the disappointing Wild Card weekend, the top 4 seeds in both conferences advanced this weekend to the Conference Championships.
How must Doug Brien of the Jets be feeling this weekend? To win in overtime in the Wild Card, to missing two in the Divisional game versus the best team in football? The Jets kept pace all game, with Big Ben having one of his worst performances of the year.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good football weekend. After the disappointing Wild Card weekend, the top 4 seeds in both conferences advanced this weekend to the Conference Championships.</p>
<p>How must Doug Brien of the Jets be feeling this weekend? To win in overtime in the Wild Card, to missing two in the Divisional game versus the best team in football? The Jets kept pace all game, with Big Ben having one of his worst performances of the year. To doink the crossbar, and then wide left, Brien must be kicking himself (pun intended).</p>
<p>I didn’t expect the Falcons to manhandle the Rams as much as they did. I’m not a big Vick believer, but his escapability in the pocket was amazing. To think Donatell got canned in Green Bay and had such success in Atlanta. Sure, the head coach is a former defensive coordinator as well, but based on Green Bay’s performance this year defensively, I have a hard time blaming the defensive coordinator.</p>
<p>The Eagles game wasn’t a surprise at all, that game went as expected. The Pats – Colts game on the other hand was. I was hoping the Pats would win, and with the field conditions I held out hope. But to utterly dominate the Colts high powered offense with the injuries the Pats have on defense, was quite a surprise. Dillon ran hard, and three of the Pats scoring drives (FG, TD, TD) each averaged 8 minute drives. When you can keep Manning off the field like that, you’ll win.</p>
<p>Two more weekends of football, and then the long dark time until late summer.</p>

            <description>I want to dedicate two nights a week to programming / web development. Unfortunately, with the 3 machines I have here at my desk, my Windows box is the only one really set up for any type of long term typing.
The problem is I’m used to Bluefish on linux, and recently I also tried Screem, which was equally impressive. Jedit on Windows is just plain ugly, and feature lacking, and there really aren’t any other good open source alternatives I’ve found.</description>

<p>So much work to do, so little time.</p>
<p>In other news, Matt came over this weekend, and we’re 90% done with the electrical wiring. Get the ceiling boxed out, fnish the wiring, get the insulation in and we’re ready for the drywall! I need to keep the momentum going with the basement, so I don’t stall anymore.</p>

On my list for quite a while is a few books by Lawrence Lessig, founder of Creative Commons, EFF board member, and a Stanford law professor. I bought The Future of Ideas and Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Control Creativity.</description>

            <description>Over a year ago when the 2003 TV season started, I blogged about Alias rebooting for the third time.
After sitting on my TiVo for over a week, I sat down and watched this season’s premiere and the current episode. We’re now on to Alias 4.0, another reboot to start the 4th season. I enjoy the show, but it’s getting harder to suspend my disbelief after all of the plot holes that open up every time they decide to start over.</description>

<p>After sitting on my TiVo for over a week, I sat down and watched this season’s premiere and the current episode. We’re now on to Alias 4.0, another reboot to start the 4th season. I enjoy the show, but it’s getting harder to suspend my disbelief after all of the plot holes that open up every time they decide to start over.</p>
<p>This time, we find Sydney, Jack, Vaughn and Dixon have been transferred to a black ops division of the CIA. (The show can now just ignore the whole workings of the CIA). And guess who they’re working for – Sloan! We have now recreated SD-6, but sanctioned by the CIA now. By the end of the 2nd episode, Weiss &amp; Marshall are working for them now.</p>
<p>I’ll give them some credit – continuing plot points are still there, with the tension between Sydney and Jack regarding her mother, Rombaldi, and Vaugh and Sydney’s romance. I’ll give it a try, but I’m at the end of the line. I’m all for watching a well done espionage with a beautiful heroine, but at least try and keep a plot for more than one season. I understand that people didn’t watch the show because they couldn’t follow the plot if they missed an episode or two, but dammit people, buy a TiVo. That’s my favorite part of shows like Alias &amp; 24.</p>

            <description>Gizmodo has their interview with Bill
Gates Part Four: Communists and DRM up.
Bill Gates, Microsoft’s chariman has been getting flak for some comments at CES where he equates those who don’t favor copyright and DRM as communists. He more than proves that it’s Gates himself that doesn’t get it in the above interview.
Look Bill: No one questions that artists should be compensated for their work. Period. The fact that some of us may choose to create content, say, a blog, and not want to be compensated, and want to share it, is our choice.</description>

            <description>Will tomorrow be the day Mike Sherman loses his GM responsibilities?
Will he be able to transition to “just” being a coach?
Will he be happy if he doesn’t get a contract extension as he enters the final year of his contract next year?
Will he even be our coach after next season?
I guess we’ll find out some of these answers tomorrow! Change is good. We don’t need more disappointment from the Packers.</description>

<p>I guess we’ll find out some of these answers tomorrow! Change is good. We don’t need more disappointment from the Packers. Sherman’s record is amazing, but his lack of success in the postseason is very disturbing. I don’t question his drive, his motivation and his will to win. But when is it too much for one person? It will take change to get to the next level, so change is good.</p>

            <description>And that day is getting closer.
Today marked the start of MacWorld, and in typical Steve Jobs fashion, he unveiled a slew of new things. I won’t get into all the cool software, but Jobs did unveil the iPod Shuffle, a flash drive iPod, and more imporantly, the Mac Mini.
A headless Mac G4, you buy this wonderful little piece of technology, and bring your own monitor, mouse and keyboard. It is tiny, cute and semi-powerful (for a Mac).</description>

<p>A headless Mac G4, you buy this wonderful little piece of technology, and bring your own monitor, mouse and keyboard. It is tiny, cute and semi-powerful (for a Mac). It lacks a decent video card, but who games on Apple machines anyway.</p>
<p>I think this is a smart move for Apple – with the success of iTunes, they may be able to pull off their Switch campaign yet. Starting at $499 for a G4 1.25 gHz with a 40 gig HD, to $599 for a 1.42 gHz with an 80 gig HD, you can upgrade ’em to DVD burners, wireless as well as bluetooth. Introduce yourself to the power of Unix in a cute form factor.</p>

            <description>Cory Doctorow discusses why you can’t legally back up your DVDs and who is to blame. Suffice to say, DRM, Digital Rights Management, is evil.
Cory Doctorow, European OutReach Coordinator for the EFF, is a science fiction author, DRM expert, and blogger.
One of my favorite authors on the evils of DRM, he once even gave a speech, at Microsoft, on the evils of DRM. From the speech, introducing himself to the crowd, he sums up what he does:</description>

            <description>This may be better suited for my technical blog – and speaking of irony, I was going to link to it, but silwenae.com isn’t responding. I registered paulcutler.org to test out Nearlyfreespeech.net, a webhosting company. I had first heard of Nearlyfreespeech when Bugmenot.com came under fire. Bugmenot is a website dedicated to providing logins to sites that require registration, so you can bypass giving your personal information to sites like Wall Street Journal, New York Times, or most newspaper websites.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This may be better suited for my technical blog – and speaking of irony, I was going to link to it, but silwenae.com isn’t responding. I registered paulcutler.org to test out <a href="http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net">Nearlyfreespeech.net</a>, a webhosting company. I had first heard of Nearlyfreespeech when <a href="http://www.bugmenot.com">Bugmenot.com</a> came under fire. Bugmenot is a website dedicated to providing logins to sites that require registration, so you can bypass giving your personal information to sites like Wall Street Journal, New York Times, or most newspaper websites. Nearlyfreespeech hosted them after Bugmenot was dumped by their current host.</p>
<p>Webhosting is an odd business. Prices have come down dramatically in the last few years, and most webhosts are just resellers rebranding others services, like ThePlanet. They offer control panels to make it easy for non-technical folks to get their websites up and manage their email. Nearlyfreespeech isn’t all that different, as their servers are colocated within one of those type of hosting centers, but they differ in a few areas. There are no monthly fees – you pay for the bandwidth you use over time, minus any credit card fees after you give them a deposit. There are no frills – it’s not for newbies. They actually give you more control over the sites you use, but you need to know what you’re doing.</p>
<p>Most webhosts will give you a set number of things: email accounts, how much bandwidth you can use, subdomains (xxxx.paulcutler.org with xxxx being a subdomain), how many databases you can have, how many other domains you can host on your site (for instance, with silwenae.com / pixehost as my webhost, I can have 5 more domains, as I have movietuesday.com and jholzer.com hosted there as well), etc. Nearlyfreespeech basically says do what you will, just pay for your traffic, with one exception. They don’t do email, just web hosting.</p>
<p>As I was talking to Fazin yesterday, who helped with a database import problem I was having, he pointed out the lack of email. This is a challenge, as silwenae at silwenae dot com has become my email address for everything over the last few years. I’m pretty interested in migrating from pixiehost to nearlyfreespeech, but now I have to research email options. When silwenae.net was up in it’s heyday running a linux distro called e-smith, e-smith had awesome email integration built in. But when I decided to run my own true linux server out of the house, as opposed to a distro that made it very easy to setup (with caveats), email hosting is something that is complex that I didn’t go with as I taught myself sysadmin stuff. From running Fedora Core, to now Ubuntu, I’ll need to figure that out as I debate my options for email, but that’s another post for a different time.</p>
<p>So far, I’m happy with nearlyfreespeech. It’s always been up, I can have multiple users, and for someone like me who just runs hobby sites, it should save me some money. (No matter what I tell myself, silwenae.com and such will never be big traffic generators). Silwenae.com on pixiehost is currently down again – even my wife who was hosting her site with them transferred to a new host. Now I need to get off my butt, get the silwenae.net server in my basement up this weekend, figure out my email and then start transferring websites.</p>

            <description>The 2nd best Christmas Present I received was a book from a co-worker: The Daily Adventures of Mixerman, by Mixerman.
The book tells the story of Mixerman, a sound engineer in Los Angeles hired to mix a new up and coming band’s CD. This dysfunctional band, signed to the label after a bidding war, has been locked away by the music label for 2 years to write a “radio hit”. Everyone in the book is anonymous, including the author, to protect the band’s identity.</description>

<p>The book tells the story of Mixerman, a sound engineer in Los Angeles hired to mix a new up and coming band’s CD. This dysfunctional band, signed to the label after a bidding war, has been locked away by the music label for 2 years to write a “radio hit”. Everyone in the book is anonymous, including the author, to protect the band’s identity. From Willy Show, the big time producer, nick named because his contract to produce the album isn’t done and he doesn’t show up for a week, to the aptly named Dumb Ass, the drummer who can’t do anything right.</p>
<p>The book is a hilarious look at everything that can go wrong in a recording session, and a behind the scenes look at the music industry. Originally posted almost as a blog in 2002 (before blogs were cool), the book contains all of the blog entries, and the missing final entry. It was easy reading, and will keep you laughing the whole way through.</p>

Without rehashing all of that history again, Rev105 is <a href="http://access.minnesota.publicradio.org/press_releases/releases/20041216_wcallaunch.php">being re-created by Minnesota Public Radio</a>. The purchase of WCAL, St. Olaf’s classical radio station, was met by animosity in Minnesota, as MPR bought out the classical competition in the city. But MPR’s vision for the new KCMP is a radio station dedicated to local music. Following the template of LA’s KCRW and Seattle’s KEXP, 89.3 KCMP will have a focus first on the local scene, and then dedicated to playing music no one else does.</p>
<p>How is this re-creating Rev105? Well, their station director is Steve Nelson, the former co-host (with Brian Oake now on Clear Channel’s 97.1) of Rev105, who left after some time after the Capital Cities buyout to go to NPR. Steve was also a founder of Radio K 770, and has been on their board of directors for quite some time. Thorn, KCMP’s music director, was the afternoon drive-time DJ on Rev105. And their newest DJ is Mary Lucia, who hosted nights on Rev105, and mornings with Brian after the buy-out and Steve leaving.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.publicradio.org/columns/minnesota/conversation/">MPR is hosting a blog dedicated to the launch of KCMP</a> as they prepare to go live. No go live date yet, but my anticipation is building.</p>

This time, I’ve moved my blog from silwenae.net to the newly created paulcutler.org. Why you may ask? I wanted to try out nearlyfreespeech.net in preparation for moving hosting companies. That’s a different discussion topic all together. Thanks to Fazin once again for the technical support in making it happen this morning.
So much stuff to blog about since the downtime: MPR’s new radio station, politics, Packers meltdown, and the Badgers too, books, and other stuff.</description>

I love Bloom County, as I’ve commented before. Re-reading and collecting those 80s comic books reminds me not only of my childhood, but how topical Mr. Breathed’s cartooning is and was. So much of what he talked about then still applies to today.
He has a 25th anniverary book coming out of his favorite Sunday comics he wrote.</description>

            <description>Interesting… Jinzora, an open source music web management system, has announced they are working on version 2.0, that will offer an option of their normal PHP scripting, or a MySQL option.
A MySQL option is very intriguing, as I may be able to replace Netjuke, which has had one update to CVS in the 4 months as they work (or not work) on Netjuke 2.0.
I’ll have to keep an eye on this, and maybe even test out the current 1.</description>

            <description>I made it to about 12:30 last night, and then started to nod off. Was awake on and off until 2 am when I finally crawled into bed.
Turned on CNN this morning. Was happy to see Wisconsin went for Kerry and Feingold, but to say I’m disappointed in the end result nationally, is an understatement.
I’m shocked at the margin of winning, and how many Senate races went Republican. Shocked.</description>

            <description>And I’m not talking about conservatism.
The Minneapolis Star Tribune’s lead story at this hour is about election concerns in Minnesota.
Higher than expected turnout, and that’s saying something as Minnesota led the nation 4 years ago at 69%, reports of voter intimidation, Moveon.org staffing their tables, and running out of new voter registration cards are just some of the things covered in the article.
And the mouthpiece of the Republican party, Norm Coleman, mouthing off about concerns of fraud.</description>

            <description>As expected, way too close to call. Indiana, Kentucky and Georgia to Bush, NH to Kerry.
Ohio just closed – too close to call.
Winning Senate races all over the place – Colorado &amp;amp; Kentucky are pickups, lose Georgia. Way too early to really tell on all of those already.</description>

One report here locally from a friend is he arrived at the polls at 7:05. And there was already a huge line of 100-150 people waiting to vote.

            <description>Spent the weekend on and off attacking my to-do list.
Got the den cleaned up, a bit. Most everything off the floor.
Spent a good chunk of the weekend trying to stop the lockups on my Ubuntu desktop. It’s definitely a Nvidia bug. Started with X freezing, but the mouse pointer works. Found the bug on nvnews.net, but no solution. Asked for help on the Ubuntu forums, but no luck there.</description>

<p>Got the den cleaned up, a bit. Most everything off the floor.</p>
<p>Spent a good chunk of the weekend trying to stop the lockups on my Ubuntu desktop. It’s definitely a Nvidia bug. Started with X freezing, but the mouse pointer works. <a href="http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=31858">Found the bug on nvnews.net</a>, but no solution. Asked for help on the <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org">Ubuntu forums</a>, but no luck there. Asked for help on the TCLUG, but can’t even get to my mail now with the frequent lock ups.</p>
<p>I’ve installed and un-installed the Nvidia packages from Ubuntu, messed with my XFree86-4 configuration file, including making sure the modules are right, and even trying with and without the DRI module as some posts indicate. It definitely has something to do with the GL functions – the screensavers and GLXgears lock it up instantly.</p>
<p>The next two things to try are swapping 4200 cards, and maybe trying to build the Nvidia drivers from source (ugh).</p>
<p>I did get Vino working on the laptop – that’s pretty cool as I can just use the remote desktop functionality to read my email on my box from my laptop in the living room over the wireless connection. I’ll need to play with the screen resolutions a bit, as my desktop has 1600×1200 and my laptop is 1024×768, which makes it a bit hard to read at times.</p>
<p>All of this makes the case for getting my Athlon64 up and running – it might be my solution to dedicate that box as my primary linux box.</p>
<p>I disconnected my Linksys router I use as an access point. For some reason, unlike my D-Link A/G router, the Linksys won’t serve as a passthrough to my server, so any device connected to the Linksys won’t have internet access. I attempted to hook up a second D-Link, a vanilla 802.11g, but couldn’t get it to work like my A/G. It’s a pain in the ass to do it too, as I have to dedicate one machine to it, turn DHCP and all that fun stuff off, but I’ve learned I’ll have to have a second box hooked up to the A/G so I can figure out what settings I’m missing to get it to work.</p>
<p>To top it all off, I’m in the living room watching football, and my UPS freaks out. It’s probably my own fault as I don’t drain it periodically like I should, but it starts beeping and won’t stop. I’ll have to re-evaluate my power needs for my den. It’s just more to add to my to-do list. One step forward and two steps backwards.</p>

            <description>Babies don’t care about daylight savings time. Even when you keep them up late, they just want to get up the same time they always do.
Of course, it might not be a baby thing, and maybe be a kid thing, as Alex was up at 6:30. That might have been just the noise from Zoe though.</description>

            <description>I’ve been meaning to write this for the last day or two, but I went out lunch Thursday to a Vietnamese restaraunt, and had Pho for the first time. Pho has been on my list of things to try since I joined the respective mailing list.
A Vietnamese soup, quite popular in the US as well, Pho is one of the few Vietnamese dishes not served family style.
Typically made with beef, it’s a soup served in a large bowl with rice noodles, beef, and a number of assorted spices.</description>

            <description>I wasn’t there, but my family was well represented with my father and sister in Madison today as John Kerry was joined by Bruce Springsteen and 100,000 strong.
We are 5 days away and every vote counts. Pick up the phone, ask a friend to vote, it doesn’t matter for whom, but get folks to the polls. Here in Minnesota, same day voter registration is in effect, so get out the vote!</description>

            <description>So I knew Ubuntu was good, just see my last two posts. But I had no idea it was this good.
I took the liberty of installing it on my HP ze4600 laptop tonight. Popped in the CD, booted it up, clicked enter, and it hung. Repeat, hangs again. Guessing it’s an APCI problem, add a noirq to the boot command line, no go. Google around, see the F1 key is options before boot, and there it says add “noapic nolapic” to the boot command.</description>

Guessing it’s an APCI problem, add a noirq to the boot command line, no go. Google around, see the F1 key is options before boot, and there it says add “noapic nolapic” to the boot command. Voila.</p>
<p>Normal install, quick and dirty. Boot up for the first time after installation is complete.</p>
<p>What’s this? My Synaptic touchpad is working? Double-clicking the pad is just like double tapping the mouse button. Awesome! I never did get this to work on FC2.</p>
<p>Looking up at the panel I see the wireless networking strength meter. Interesting, mouse over shows it sees device ath0, my D-Link AG660 PC Card that’s in there! (I don’t use the Broadcom builtin 54G, bad Broadcom for not supporting linux!) Fire up the networking settings, add the ath0 and WEP key, disable the ethernet, and wham! bang! <strong>Full wireless network support!</strong></p>
<p>I spent days hacking at madwifi getting that to run on FC2. The first FC2 install I had it worked fairly easily, but after a reinstall I couldn’t get madwifi / atheros support to work to save my life. And here’s a distribution that installs this stuff <strong>by default</strong>.</p>
<p>I am going to make it a priority to get my music re-tagged, organized, backed up, and migrate my server over to Ubuntu in the next month or two. I’m in love, swept off my feet, by a polished, linux distribution run by Canonical, powered by Debian. I’m in awe of the work they’ve done, and am going to support them as much as I can.</p>

Each post has 4-6 comments with regular text quotations, but then the poster’s name is a link to online casinos. You’re telling me online casinos need money so badly this is what they resort too?
I’m a little angry. Got some hacking to do tonight!</description>

            <description>I took the plunge last night, inspired by my post yesterday, and installed Ubuntu on my linux box I use for chat, email, surfing, and listening to music.
I backed up my Evolution and media files, but I forgot to export my GPG private key. Oops, I’ll have to create a new one and get my new public key posted.
I have to say I was absolutely blown away. First, as a text based installer, so what – everyone wants a GUI installer but there were only a few basic questions asked during installation, and then a few more after that to get it set up.</description>

<p>I backed up my Evolution and media files, but I forgot to export my GPG private key. Oops, I’ll have to create a new one and get my new public key posted.</p>
<p>I have to say I was absolutely blown away. First, as a text based installer, so what – everyone wants a GUI installer but there were only a few basic questions asked during installation, and then a few more after that to get it set up. It was, by far, the fastest installation of any linux distribution I’ve ever seen, including Debian, Gentoo, Fedora, Suse and Mandrake that I’ve done in the last 5 years. A part of that is that package selection is pre-determined, and looking through the final package list of what’s on the system, I can’t say I disagree with any of them.</p>
<p>I said it yesterday, and I’ll say it again – Gnome 2.8 is sexy. I changed Gnome to the Industrial theme right away, I didn’t care for the earth tones of the Ubuntu default theme, nor the fonts, but that’s just personal. Evolution 2.2 wouldn’t import my old Evolution files from my Fedora box. I have ’em backed up, but I hope there wasn’t anything really important there I really need. I did Google for importing, and found a page about importing Evolution email into Thunderbird. Fired up Synaptic, installed Thunderbird, started it, and my box locked up. Hmmm. Restarted, seems to work fine. Still using Evolution at the moment, just from a starting over point, want to try the Junk filters built in now.</p>
<p>Went to change my desktop background, and tried to download a blue Ubuntu background. Firefox locked up. Restarted. Hmm. Wonder if it’s a hardware thing or just me? Seems to be working fine though.</p>
<p>Some of the things that absolutely kick ass. Clean theme, no icons on the desktop. I like splitting the Applications and Computer on the Gnome panel bar thing. Samba functionality worked out of the box. Can completely see my server in the basement and can browse SMB shares. Linked to the shares on my desktop. I never could get that working in Gnome 2.6 / Nautilus on my Fedora Core 2 box.</p>
<p>Synaptic runs like a champ. Being a long time user of Apt from Freshrpms on Fedora &amp; Red Hat, on a Debian based system it even feels better.</p>
<p>Next steps are getting full multimedia functionality, including DVD &amp; MP3; Bluefish and some editor type stuff, and seeing if Rhythmbox can connect over a Samba share. And maybe importing my Evolution stuff.</p>
<p>Then I’ll be on to installing Ubuntu on the laptop and the Athlon 64! And if I’m really daring, wiping my Gaming box. Getting closer everyday.</p>

            <description>Finally figured out what’s hanging my linux box – GAIM, my IM client. Can’t say I’m shocked, there have been a ton of updates lately.
It’s driving me pretty close to using Ubuntu Linux though. I’ve tried Debian, Gentoo, and have been (and still am) a long time user of Red Hat &amp;amp; Fedora. The box currently has Fedora Core 2 on it, and Fedora Core 3 hasn’t come out fast enough for me.</description>

<p>It’s driving me pretty close to using <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu Linux</a> though. I’ve tried Debian, Gentoo, and have been (and still am) a long time user of Red Hat &amp; Fedora. The box currently has Fedora Core 2 on it, and Fedora Core 3 hasn’t come out fast enough for me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gnome.org">Gnome 2.8</a> is sexy.</p>
<p>Ubuntu, as a Debian derivative is very interesting me. 6 month release cycles (similar to Fedora), tied to Gnome releases, which are 6 months as well (close, but not quite similar to Fedora).</p>
<p>I am very excited about the community aspect of Ubuntu – Debian with all the updates, contributed back to the Debian core teams, funded by a .com millionaire to make a great Linux distro. As a huge Gnome fan, their Gnome integration looks (from the outside) fabulous. All the power of apt-get, with the power of Debian.</p>
<p>I always hated the Debian installer – I had to actually get help at a <a href="http://www.tclug.org">TCLUG</a> installfest to get installed (damn network). Ubuntu looks to take some of that complexity away. In addition, their interesting choice of using sudo instead of a root account is intriguing.</p>
<p>I tried their pre-release on my laptop, but it wouldn’t boot, but I’m sure it was ACPI related. I just didn’t spend the 15 minutes needed to find the boot command. I burned the final version last week – I’m going to get on my linux box as I backed up my music and email a day or two ago, and then my laptop and AMD64 box right after that.</p>
<p>More to come.</p>

            <description>If you don’t read ESPN’s Daily Quick on Page 2, you should.
One editor’s opinions about the previous day’s sports activities. While there is a lot of bandwagon hopping on and off certain trends, Dan Shakoff provides insight and opinions that’s worth the 5 minute read daily. (See University of Wisconsin: highlights potential upset for Northwestern Friday, today’s he’s hopping on the Badger bandwagon for a BCS championship bid).
Tomorrow: Tuesday Morning QB on NFL.</description>

            <description>Badgers &amp;amp; Packers both win big this weekend.
With the exception of 2 minutes in the 2nd half, the Badgers were dominating, even with 3 defensive starters out.
Packers looked simply awesome (where have they been all year?!) – Grady Jackson was back stuffing the run and knocking down a pass, the secondary looked good, and the offense looked awesome. Go Go Javon and Ahman!
Badgers are off this weekend, and the Packers are at the Redskins.</description>

            <description>Ah, the 80’s. When I was young, impressionable, and naive.
From the goodness that is BoingBoing, I bring you: The Last Starfighter: The Musical, an off Broadway production.
Jason Scott’s blog has the review.
One of my favorite movies, I remember when Jason bought this a year or two back (at full price, no less) and we watched it. And then John mentioned a month or two back he had bought it too.</description>

            <description>Let’s see… I placed 5th in Fusion Frenzy, pretty much dead last in Rally Sport, and somewhere middle of the pack in UT2k4 (nice teams Scott!).
The big news is, as we’re in the middle of the Doom3 Tournament, 2nd round, I beat Fazin. I could lose out from here and be happy.</description>

            <description>So I’m sitting here at the in-laws, have a while till I leave.
So I fixed all the imported blog entries from my old blog. All of the categories are now correct.
Still not sure why the old blog entries that had hyperlinks in them only show up when you click the whole entry instead of the front page, but I’m not going to worry about it. If people are going back a year and a half to read my blog entries, they’ll figure it out.</description>

            <description>In Milwaukee, leaving in a few hours.
Think I’ll stop at Kopps for lunch and have one of the greasiest burgers money can buy. Reminds me of when I first started working for Best Buy and ate at the Kopps across the street from the Southridge store. And don’t get me started on the custard…
Camera is ready, Flickr is purchased, digital imaging software is installed on my gaming PC (what blasphemy – productivity software installed on my gaming PC, and it’s M$ software at that).</description>

            <description>Boing Boing is full of random goodness today.
First, BB has a link to Found Item Clothing, who has re-created the shirts from the movie Real Genius that Chris Knight (played by Val Kilmer wore).
Next, BB points out that William Gibson (of Neuromancer and other books’ fame) has started blogging again.
It looks like the current election cycle has gotten to him. Let me quote one of the jokes he has up on his site:</description>

<blockquote>
<p>President Bush goes to an elementary school to talk about the war.</p>
<p>After his talk, he offers to answer questions. One little boy puts up his hand and the president asks him his name.</p>
<p>“I’m Billy, sir.”</p>
<p>“And what’s your question, Billy?”</p>
<p>“I have three questions, sir. Why did the US invade Iraq without the support of the UN? Why are you President when Al Gore got more votes? And whatever happened to Osama Bin Laden?”</p>
<p>Just then the bell rings for recess. Bush announces that they’ll continue after recess.</p>
<p>When they return, Bush asks, “OK, where were we? Question time! Who has a question?”</p>
<p>Another little boy raises his hand. The president asks his name.</p>
<p>“I’m Steve, sir.”</p>
<p>“And what’s your question, Steve?”</p>
<p>“I have five questions, sir. Why did the US invade Iraq without the support of the UN? Why are you President when Al Gore got more votes? Whatever happened to Osama Bin Laden? Why did the recess bell go off twenty minutes early? And what the heck happened to Billy?”</p>

            <description>Well, I went ahead and purchased a Pro account of Flickr for this weekend.
In testing the service out I used 99% of my allowed bandwidth (oops!). This jumps me from 10 MB of bandwidth to 1 gig. That should be plenty.
This should be fun, charging the new camera up now.</description>

            <description>After some configuration hassles, I’ve added the Wiki!.
I even threw a FAQ up and added the link to the sidebar.
The configuration hassles were minimal, mostly involved re-reading the directions five times to enable mysql support with encrypted password. Then I had to change a setting in the php.ini file. The error code was a little misleading that it made me think it was a Wiki configuration problem, instead of PHP, but some googling around got me the answer.</description>

<p>The funny thing about it is the Wiki comes with a number of differently themes to choose from (I have MacOSX up now). The built-in WordPress theme for Wiki was the exact same WordPress theme I was using on the blog. Until yesterday that is when I changed. But it’s staying the way it is.</p>

            <description>Patched my version of WordPress, forgot the kids. Will do that tomorrow.
Have to think about creating flickr accounts for them. Or finding some really, really good Gallery hacks, but man Flickr has blown me away.
Except I went and used all my bandwidth this month. Whoops, need to blog pictures this weekend still.</description>

            <description>What started as a small project finished 2+ hours later with great results.
Started with getting the domain (MovieTuesday.com setup and hosted on silwenae.com.
That has had me thinking about the engine required to power it, and WordPress has a small security update out. Installed that here on the blog, and then installed the Kubrick template as the style I was using wasn’t doing that much for me. I dig Kubrick, it even comes with the Photoshop files to add the header picture, we’ll have to see if the Gimp can open those.</description>

<p>Started with getting the domain (<a href="http://www.movietuesday.com">MovieTuesday.com</a> setup and hosted on <a href="http://www.silwenae.com">silwenae.com</a>.</p>
<p>That has had me thinking about the engine required to power it, and <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> has a small security update out. Installed that here on the blog, and then installed the <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick/">Kubrick template</a> as the style I was using wasn’t doing that much for me. I dig Kubrick, it even comes with the Photoshop files to add the header picture, we’ll have to see if the <a href="http://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a> can open those. If not, the readme has the file dimesnions, but I’m not much of an artist anyway. I would like to get links along the bottom of the header picture like the author used.</p>
<p>We (Kelly had to help me) spent a half hour trying to update my links in the sidebar, had to flesh out some PHP errors, but in the end it’s working, which gives me hope for the other things I want to add (Random photo’s, wishlist, desktop screenshot, now reading and listening, list goes on…).</p>
<p>And last but definitely not least, I’ve strugged over the last month with my former blog running <a href="http://www.b2evolution.net">B2evolution</a> to get the XML / RSS output to be XML compliant so WordPress would import all my old posts.</p>
<p>Upgrading my old blog installation to the latest and greatest of B2Evo always resulted in database errors. I must have gone through that half a dozen times the last time I tried a month ago, and the kicker was whatever error the database schema encountered, I wasn’t able to delete the database when done. Tried again tonight, no luck. Being the smart feller I am, I installed the second latest verions of B2Evo, upgraded, and what do you know, the import took! It only took the last 5 entries I had done last November, spent 5 to 10 minutes figuring out how to get all posts to show, imported again and the magic box worked.</p>
<p>I’m guessing there were about 70 posts from the old blog from Jan ’03 to Nov ’03. I’ll need to go back through them over time and assign them categories, they’re all in the General category at the moment. The other odd thing is the links don’t look like they worked when scanning the posts (pick a month) – but if you actually click a post for the details, the links did work. So if I’m really motivated, I can fix those too through the edit portion.</p>
<p>I’m just happy it’s finally imported! Even if I had a huge break between posting, I have my evil company posts, my rants on radio (with the Rev105 tribute). EFF support way back when, and some early looks at Howard Dean.</p>
<p>In other site news, I registered for a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/99002017@N00/">Flickr account</a>. I may try using that to photo blog the gaming party this weekend in Chicago. I’m uploading the Jan ’03 LAN Party pictures as we speak to try it out.</p>

            <description>So I have a lot of music. With over 700 CDs ripped, and some other misc. music, it’s quite a bear to manage it all.
For the last few years, I’ve used Netjuke on my Linux server. During the upgrade process this past spring, I put my music on two seperate hard drives, seperate from the third which holds the OS. What I love about Netjuke is that it’s database driven, making it very easy to search, and a nice web interface, that is semi-skinnable.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I have a lot of music. With over 700 CDs ripped, and some other misc. music, it’s quite a bear to manage it all.</p>
<p>For the last few years, I’ve used <a href="http://www.netjuke.org">Netjuke</a> on my Linux server. During the upgrade process this past spring, I put my music on two seperate hard drives, seperate from the third which holds the OS. What I love about Netjuke is that it’s database driven, making it very easy to search, and a nice web interface, that is semi-skinnable. It’s also GPL.</p>
<p>The downside is that Netjuke 2.0 has been in development for almost (or just over?) a year. Netjuke 1 was released in Aug. ’03, and no updates since. Netjuke 2.0 development has been quiet for almost 6 months, with no updates, and the CVS is unusable. And there is talk that it will be propietary, not GPL, which doesn’t make me happy.</p>
<p>I’ve been looking at other projects, first <a href="http://www.turnstyle.com/andromeda/home.asp">Andromeda</a>, which is a PHP script that is not database driven. I had used Andromeda before Netjuke, and purchased it again this past spring when I had some installation problems with Netjuke 1.0, but still wasn’t happy with it.</p>
<p>On the Netjuke forums, I came across <a href="http://www.jinzora.org/index.php">Jinzora</a>, which looks similar to Andromeda, but has more functionality through PHP scripting. Features include ID3 tagging, server side playback (which Netjuke can do kind of), file downloading, RSS feeds, and a slim version for adding via an iframe.</p>
<p>I still have some questions that the FAQ, Wiki and forums didn’t answer around multiple directories (I have my Ogg and MP3 files in seperate directories, but those directories have identical artists, but different albums).</p>
<p>I still have some work to do to finish cleaning up some ID3 tags, and getting some newer music on the site and syncing it all up, but this is another project to add to my list. I still have to figure out why the ID3 tags for some live Dave Mathews stuff isn’t working in Netjuke too.</p>
<p>In addition, I need to get a linux box up with a sufficiently big enough hard drive so I can rsync nightly or weekly to back it all up. My Mirra won’t back up a network drive, and I had mapped my music directories on my linux box over Samba to my extra Windows box hoping it would. Dammit.</p>
<p>Speaking of music, I need to find out how Windows serving works. A while back I received <a href="http://www.omnifimedia.com/home/">Omnifi</a> for the car and my home receiver. While pretty cool to transfer my music to my car’s hard drive, the car version was way to sensitive and doesn’t work. I still have the set top box hooked up to my home theater, and that works streaming from my extra Windows box where I have some of my music duplicated from my server. The downside is that Omnifi uses software to manage your music collection called SimpleCenter. This is one of the worst designed music interfaces ever created. The one neat feature it has is “Watch Folders” where you point it towards your music folder, and it automatically notices when you add music to that folder and adds it to your collection. It does not support Ogg, but does support Rhapsody and some internet music stations.</p>
<p>I had purchased The Killers new CD, ripped it to MP3 (bleh) and put it on my Windows box. Firing up the Omnifi, lo and behold I see a Musicmatch server on it – sure enough, from my <a href="http://www.silwenae.net/blog/index.php?p=46">Linksys boombox installation</a>, Musicmatch has the identical ability that SimpleCenter, including watch folders, and what not. So I import all the music on that Windows box into MusicMatch, and can use that on my Omnifi. From managing my music on my PC, I prefer the MusicMatch interface – it’s not my favorite either, but it has some better features built-in including ID3 tagging, and the interface is cleaner to use, but it has too many advanced features to get you to buy crap.</p>
<p>So the questions becomes what is the SDK that they’re using – terminology is identical (Watch Folders, etc) and what would it take to get it ported to Linux. If I could have my whole collection on my server serving my house (with the exception of Ogg dammit, and I’m not re-encoding that stuff), I would be golden.</p>
<p>So much work, so little time.</p>

            <description>Back from sunny Orlando.
Sunny and 85, with a few clouds on Fri. and Sat. Not that I’m complaining, though flying back today, the Twin Cities weather is nicer than it was there, but at least the storm we left in Orlando didn’t have a name.
Not sure how I survived 4+ days without internet access, lots of work and lots of play got me through.
Off to Chicago this week for the BFG lan party, I may try to blog it live.</description>

<p>Off to Chicago this week for the BFG lan party, I may try to blog it live. It will depend on the setup there, and transferring photo’s from my camera to the PC to the website, we shall see, it might be kind of cool to try. Long as I don’t pass out again.</p>
<p>Packers better win tonight. That is all.</p>

No, we both don’t own basketball teams. (I’d buy an NFL team first!)
Mark Cuban was in the news last week for donating $100,000 to the EFF to fight the INDUCE Act. It appears to be working, as INDUCE is dead for the rest of this year.
Oh, and we’re on some mailing list together.</description>

            <description>The EFF is suing the FCC over the Broadcast Flag.
 The brief argues that the FCC has no authority to regulate digital TV sets and other digital devices unless specifically instructed to do so by Congress. While the FCC does have jurisdiction over TV transmissions, transmissions are not at issue here. The broadcast flag limits the way digital material can be used after the broadcast has already been received. “Bowing to a group of copyright holders led by the MPAA, the FCC promulgated a rule drafted by those corporate interests that will dictate design aspects of a vast array of consumer electronics – televisions, DVD recorders, TiVos, digital VCRs, iPods, and cell phones – for years to come,” the brief reads.</description>

<p>ALA legislative counsel Miriam M. Nisbet said, “Two years ago Congress passed a law allowing for use of copyrighted works for distance education. Yet now the FCC through the broadcast flag would prevent schools from using an entire category of those works — high definition television programs — in distance education.”</p>
<p>Filing the brief along with EFF, PK, and the ALA were the Association of Research Libraries, American Association of Law Libraries, Medical Library Association, Special Libraries Association, Consumer Federation of America, and Consumers Union.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great thing to see. and I’ll continue to publish other links that <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/10/05/eff_suing_the_fcc_ov.html">cover it</a>, such as <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">Boing Boing</a>. Building a HDTV HTPC is a priority for me, along with getting the basement done. With pcHDTV’s out of stock on Linux HDTV cards, it will be interesting to see if I can get this done in time. I firmly believe the Broadcast Flag is an evil, evil thing. I want to record the shows I want to, when I want, without the government interfering.</p>
<p>Actions like this make me proud to be a <a href="https://secure.eff.org/site/apps/ka/sl/singlepledgebasket.asp?c=esJNJ5OWF&amp;b=131889&amp;en=gfLGIMNvH8IDLPPpG3IEJQNzEpKQLTPyGiKMJQOsGhK1H">Pioneer level member of the EFF.</a></p>

            <description>I saw on Daily Kos, a liberal weblog, this morning, that Clear Channel has put up 11 billboards across the Twin Cities saying “Don’t Vote“.
According to a Clear Channel spokesman, the billboards are a teaser ad for an ad campaign that will be unveiled on Oct. 11th. The billboards are in predominantly minority neighborhoods. Clear Channel claims that at first they said no to the campaign until they saw the whole thing, which will be in good taste.</description>

<p>No matter what the ad campaign, even if it’s for their radio stations (of which they have almost 50% market share here in the Twin Cities), this is in poor taste, even if it’s nothing to do with this years election.</p>
<p>At some point, I need to get my old blog imported here, so I can link back to the stories I did on why Clear Channel is evil, and why radio here in the Twin Cities sucks (Thanks Clear Channel and ABC Capital Cities Radio!).</p>
<p>And don’t forget, Clear Channel executives have a nice history of giving to the Republican party…</p>

            <description>It’s going to be a long day today. I’ve already received a hard time about the Packers loss yesterday… I even subjected myself to KFAN this morning on the way in to hear them laugh long and hard at the Pack.
I’m not a big fan of Fox’s first team broadcasting group of Joe Buck, Troy Aikman, and Cris Collinsworth, but I thought they were absolutely right when they were saying that the Packers’ offense is still searching for an identity.</description>

After running the ball and stuffing it down the Panthers throat in Week 1, they haven’t stuck with their gameplan week after week.</p>
<p>I was surprised this morning to see Pederson on the injury list on ESPN. I had thought, as did the announcers, that Nall had entered the game because he had the stronger arm for the hail mary at the end of the game. Here’s to hoping that Favre is back next week.</p>

            <description>I recently received a Linksys Wireless-B Music System. The device is pretty cool, and designed fairly well.
Using a wired or wireless connection, you can stream MP3 (no Ogg!) from your PC, internet radio and Rhapsody if you have a subscription.
Fairly good design, including ethernet, optical audio out or RCA out. Detachable speakers so you can even just hook it up to your stereo. But where the block is for all these outs, there’s still a fairly large hole – like where batteries should be.</description>

<p>So it’s a wireless music system – <em>as long as AC power is plugged in</em>. They couldn’t have found room for two C batteries? Of course, checking the wireless settings and streaming from a PC would probably drain them pretty quick, but still.</p>
<p>The speakers don’t even sound too bad.</p>
<p>So close, but yet so far in design.</p>

            <description>I heard on the way home last night on National Public Radio, that the 2nd Circuit Court has struck down key portions of Section 505 of the Patriot Act.
Specifically, Section 505 allows the Justice Department to send a NSL, National Security Letter, to businesses, demanding information related to terrorism, without a court order. U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marreo found this disturbing without judicial oversight. The Justice Department was required to submit a list of all businesses that they had done this to – and did, which was 5 pages long, with every line blacked out.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I heard on the way home last night on <a href="http://www.npr.org/">National Public Radio</a>, that the 2nd Circuit Court has <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4053187">struck</a> <a href="http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2004_09.php#001945">down</a> key portions of Section 505 of the <a href="http://www.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/Terrorism/PATRIOT/">Patriot Act</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, Section 505 allows the Justice Department to send a NSL, National Security Letter, to businesses, demanding information related to terrorism, without a court order. U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marreo found this disturbing without judicial oversight. The Justice Department was required to submit a list of all businesses that they had done this to – and did, which was 5 pages long, <em>with every line blacked out</em>.</p>
<p>Judge Victor Marreo also struck down the portion that requires individuals and business not to disclose that the DOJ or FBI has requested the letter – so even if you receive one, you coudn’t tell a lawyer.</p>
<p>The challenge was brought by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">ACLU</a>, representing a “John Doe” ISP – who by law the ACLU can’t mention by name.</p>

            <description>I got to see Lenny Kravitz up close and personal tonight at a work event. Lenny rocked the house. Amazing show. Can’t say enough about it, it was quite loud, and very entertaining. Played my favorite song, Again.
B-52s and Lenny Kravitz, both up close in less than 6 days. Good week!</description>

            <description>A week and half ago, I purchased Fable and NHL2k5 for my X-box. I’ve probably played 10-12 games of hockey, and having a blast doing it – even if on Pro I’m still winning too many, even if by only 1 goal.
I haven’t played Fable as near as much as I’ve wanted due to two things:
  Was traveling    It’s a M rated game – as I found out after I started playing it.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A week and half ago, <a href="http://www.silwenae.net/blog/index.php?p=33">I purchased Fable and NHL2k5 for my X-box</a>. I’ve probably played 10-12 games of hockey, and having a blast doing it – even if on Pro I’m still winning too many, even if by only 1 goal.</p>
<p>I haven’t played Fable as near as much as I’ve wanted due to two things:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Was traveling</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>It’s a M rated game – as I found out after I started playing it. And Alex likes watching me play way too much for him to see me playing a role playing game as I hack away at the bad guys.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So I had received a gift card last week, and after trying out <a href="http://www.farcry-thegame.com/">Farcry</a> at Kent’s a week or two ago, decided to pick it up, as I enjoy a good FPS. After the fun I had playing <a href="http://www.callofduty.com/">Call of Duty</a> single-player a year after everyone else, I decided this could be a good fit. So I bought it today. Come back to the office, and get more presents: <a href="http://www.totalwar.com/community/rome.htm">Rome: Total War</a>, a new real time strategy getting good reviews, and <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/games/swbattlefront/">Star Wars: Battlefront</a> (Warning: flash site) for the PC.</p>
<p>Considering I’ll be wiring the basement this weekend, in Orlando the following weekend, in Chicago after that, then at Lambeau the weekend after for the Cowboys game, when will I find the time? I still have Fable to play, my NFL2k5 football and hockey seasons, and two beta’s, including WoW to test. I’ve barely caught up on my TiVO from the last week or two, and here we go again… Good thing I haven’t bought X-Men from Raven yet! And I haven’t even thought about practicing for the BFG lan competition.</p>
<p>When it rains, it pours.</p>

            <description>Man, after using Firefox for months, and especially after Firefox PR1, it’s harder and harder to use IE.
Especially after installing extensions to make Firefox better. I can’t recommend the Adblock extension enough. While it’s a bit of a bear at first getting the ad blacklist created, it’s gorgeous to use on sites you surf a lot. (Basically you’ll see a little “Adblock” button on ads, click that and it blocks the ad on a per site basis.</description>

            <description>I turned the Packer game on a few minutes late yesterday. I was thinking that DirecTV would blackout the Packer game as it was the game of the week on Fox, and Fox was still showing the Vikings-Bears game that was running late. So I change the TiVo to the Packer game (after watching the Chiefs lose) and lo, and behold, the Packer game is on Sunday Ticket (much less ranting to be had than last year).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I turned the Packer game on a few minutes late yesterday. I was thinking that DirecTV would blackout the Packer game as it was the game of the week on Fox, and Fox was still showing the Vikings-Bears game that was running late. So I change the TiVo to the Packer game (after watching the Chiefs lose) and lo, and behold, the Packer game is on Sunday Ticket (much less ranting to be had than last year).</p>
<p>3 minutes into the game, and I’ve already missed a Manning TD. Thinking to myself, hmm, they must have had a kick return for a TD… as I watch Favre air it out to Javon Walker for a TD strike. Back from commercials, I see Manning has already thrown one as Favre matches him, and again it happens – Manning TD, Favre matches him, 14-14 first quarter.</p>
<p>And they were just getting warmed up. 22 straight passes by Manning before Edge even touched the ball. Packers blitzing, blitzing, blizting… defensive doesn’t adjust once in the first half as they continue to play a base 4-3 as they blitz and Manning continues to pick them apart. 1st half ends, Colts have 35 points, all Manning TDs.</p>
<p>Second half starts, what’s this? Packers are in a dime! They adjusted their defensive scheme! Driver continues to drop balls with a few catches, Walker remains hot, Ferguson is non-factor on offense with his injury, but has an great kick return. Packers are trying to slow down the tempo a bit, offense and defense seem to be working. Holding Manning and Co. to 3 points so far.</p>
<p>And then Javon Walker is stripped at mid-field. Colts DB has been lit up by Favre all day, and he makes the play of the game on a beautiful, text-book rip-it-out-of-your-arms strip. Manning walks them down the field, some confusion to get to 2 minutes, Packers burning time outs. TD Edge. Game over.</p>
<p>At one point, early in the game, I had looked at Kelly and said I didn’t think the Packers would be able to keep up. I was pleasantly surprised in the second half to watch them methodically work their game to get back in it. Alas, it was all for naught, but it was an entertaining football game as losses go. I would rather watch that than the self-implosion I saw versus the Bears.</p>

            <description>I’ve been meaning for a while to blog about Mozilla’s Firefox . A week or two back they released 1.0 Preview Release 1, and it blew away their previous version. The built-in RSS reader is worth it alone.
Tabbed browsing, built-in Google search bar, built-in pop-up blocking, and most of all, speed. This is true innovation in software development.
They had a goal of 1 million downloads in 10 days, and almost doubled that.</description>

            <description>Back from LA, good trip.
Beautiful weather (mid 80s, 60 at night). Stayed at the Renaissance Hotel in Hollywood, next to the Kodak Theater and Mann’s Chinese Theater. That was pretty cool being next to where the Oscars take place, and the famous movie theater. I remember the pictures of the Chinese Theater in ’77 when Star Wars opened.
Nice to be home, if still a little jet lagged.</description>

            <description>Purchased ESPN NHL2k5 and Fable yesterday. Tried to buy Fable Thurs. night, but they were already sold out.
Fable is pretty cool. Some of the combat controls take some getting used to, especially spells, but the story is cool so far.
NHL2k5 is suprisingly good. NFL2k5’s Crib feature blows NHL2k5 away, NHL2k5s is a dumbed down version. You still have challenges and can buy stuff, but from a room and item perspective, it’s not even close.</description>

<p>I am enjoying it, though I need to tweak the settings. I beat Vancouver 2-1, and the Stars 3-1, but most of the games end up being about 5-2. My shots on goal are averaging almost twice the opponents. Presentation, Sound, Graphics are all 10/10. The reflection of the ice at the start of periods after the zamboni is there is amazing – you can see the reflection of the scoreboards, and it’s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Helping Kelly build shelves today. My version of helping is watching the kids.</p>

            <description>Check out Howard’s Stern website!
He’s a little pissed at the Bush Administration, and urging folks to register to vote. His entire front page is dedicated to his effort.
I listened to Howard when I lived in Philadelphia, and enjoyed his show (though he has so many commericals…), and listened off and on for the brief time he was on here in Minnesota.
What’s interesting to me, is that I would assume his listener base would tend to vote Republican.</description>

This isn’t new for him, the last 6 months to a year he has been railing against the administration, especially after the Clear Channel debacle around the FCC fines when Clear Channel dropped him on a handful of stations (he’s distributed by Clear Channel’s largest competitor, Infinity).</p>
<p>It will be intriguing to see what impact this may or may not have on the general election.</p>

Even with a very good performance Monday night by the Pack, it will be nice to have him back.</description>

            <description>This article sums up most of my views of gaming on Linux.
I have 2 machines that still run XP – one for gaming, the other I used to 2box my other Everquest account back in the day. It still has a bunch of music I need to transfer to my server, but other than that, I keep telling myself it will be for video editing as that’s the only other thing Linux isn’t as good as Windows still.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=8245">This article sums up</a> most of my views of gaming on Linux.</p>
<p>I have 2 machines that still run XP – one for gaming, the other I used to 2box my other Everquest account back in the day. It still has a bunch of music I need to transfer to my server, but other than that, I keep telling myself it will be for video editing as that’s the only other thing Linux isn’t as good as Windows still.</p>
<p>But back to Linux gaming: As I game less and less now, I realize I have to get my basement done, as my using my high end computer for non-gaming tasks drives me nuts in Windows. For the last two weeks I’ve seriously considered wiping my XP partition, or at the least making it dual boot. But I’m lazy, though I’m getting closer every day. As I look at what games I play, only Doom 3 has the potential to be played on Linux. If I only ran Linux, I’d have UT2k4 there as well. I had great success with NeverWinter Nights on Linux, but other than that, there are no RPG choices. As I debate EQ2 and World of Warcraft, neither will play on Linux.</p>
<p>Is playing games on the X-box my only choice? (If I were to only run Linux).</p>
<p>I absolutely agree with the article regarding WINE. WINE is not an option for Linux gaming, and for developers it’s a cop-out. Yes, I understand DirectX has matured better and faster than OpenGL. But if major games can work natively on Mac OSX, is Linux that far out of reach?</p>

            <description>The Wisconsin Badgers hosted John Robinson’s UNLV football team at Camp Randall yesterday.
Looking at the history of these two teams, once again it was another strange game. Two years ago UNLV’s stadium suffered from power outages during the game, and last year UNLV stomped the Badgers 23-5 as the Badgers only scored on a field goal and a safety.
Bob Davie, former Notre Dame coach, and current color commentator for ESPN was eerily prophetic when in the first quarter he references last year’s safety by Wisconsin as UNLV is once again preparing ot punt from within their 5.</description>

<p>Looking at the history of these two teams, once again it was another strange game. Two years ago UNLV’s stadium suffered from power outages during the game, and last year UNLV stomped the Badgers 23-5 as the Badgers only scored on a field goal and a safety.</p>
<p>Bob Davie, former Notre Dame coach, and current color commentator for ESPN was eerily prophetic when in the first quarter he references last year’s safety by Wisconsin as UNLV is once again preparing ot punt from within their 5. Davie comments that UNLV won’t have forgotten tomorrow and may be nervous as the ball is hiked promptly sails over the punters head for a Badger safety.</p>
<p>Badger’s led for most of the first half 2-0, after missing 2 field goals early, including one from the 10, and a failed 4th and 1 from the Badgers 2. Badgers proceeded to score on a blocked UNLV field goal for a touchdown by Jim Leohnard and another safety. The only other scores were a field goal by UNLV and a later Badger touchdown.</p>
<p>All in all, it was kind of painful to watch, especially the first half. You would think a game featuring 2 safeties and a blocked FG for touchdown would be exciting, but the Badgers lack of offensive power was disturbing. True freshman running back Walker shows promise, but Booker Stanley is no Anthony Davis, and until Davis returns from an eye injury, the Badgers could have some trouble. QB John Stocco in his first year starting looks fairly good, with Owen Daniels and Brandon Williams being favortie targets.</p>
<p>Two games into the season, I’ve been pleasantly suprised with the UW defense. Led by a new defensive coordinator, they haven’t done anything flashy or given up really big plays, but solid and consistent play in and play out.</p>
<p>Next week: @ Arizona.</p>

            <description>So here I am watching NFL football.. watching the CBS feed on NFL Ticket and Kevin Smith pops in a commercial for Jersey Girl.
Holy crap was it funny – he holds up a picture of his wife, says how hot she was and a guy who looks like him needs the bling bling to keep her. So buy his movie. And help a fat guy out.
His self-deprecating humor cracks me up.</description>

<p>On a related note, I watched Jersey Girl this past Tuesday.</p>
<p>It was one of his better films, and very much unlike anything he has done before. While hints of his style and his older films were there (the jokes in the beginning, the 80s references, the obligatory Star Wars reference) the story was touching without being too sweet. And as much of a hard time as Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez got / get, I thought they had amazing chemistry on screen. (Don’t worry, she dies early in the flim). George Carlin has acting chops few know about, and the the girl who plays Gertie was a great actress for one so young. I highly recommend it.</p>

            <description>Ahh, NFL kickoff Sunday. Sitting here in the living room with the laptop wirelessly, flipping between games, currently on Bengals @ Jets.
Saw Resident Evil 2 last night. It was entertaining, closer to a rental than in the theater, but we had a good time.
White Chocolate Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups are weird.
In general silwenae.net news, I have my old blog re-installed, but I cannot get it imported into this one for whatever reason.</description>

            <description>So for a week my server kept going up &amp;amp; down. And up &amp;amp; down. It would connect to the ‘net for 10 minuts, and then go down for 10 minutes trying to resolve domain names. I thought it was the server – having only been up for two weeks I was convinced my lack of knowledge around the firewall had to be the culprit. Plugged the Linkys router back in and still went up and down, but not nearly as often.</description>

It would connect to the ‘net for 10 minuts, and then go down for 10 minutes trying to resolve domain names. I thought it was the server – having only been up for two weeks I was convinced my lack of knowledge around the firewall had to be the culprit. Plugged the Linkys router back in and still went up and down, but not nearly as often. (Linux servers must ping RR a bit more for current information than routers do).</p>
<p>So I broke down and called Roadrunner, and sure enough, they see power problems with the modem. Since I was the first person in Chaska to get Roadrunner service, I asked for a new modem (as Jason’s had been replaced a year or two ago, and the tech at the time claimed the new one was faster), but RR didn’t bite on the new modem.</p>
<p>So the cable tech shows up 2 days later (we’ll be there between 11 and 2, shows up at 2:45, but anyway) looks at the setup in the den and then in the basement, and does a double take. He’s shocked I even have service as my cable modem has a power rating of -10. Since I don’t have cable TV, he disconnects the coax from the house distribution and plugs the line straight into the cable modem. Then he’s pretty confident what the problem is and goes out to the gray box at the curb, and sure enough, the cable inside is completely corroded through. He tells my wife it looks like the box has been flooded, which she responds to “6 or 7 times” as the box sits between my neighbor and myself, right where the water flows down our property line when it rains.</p>
<p>Now my cable modem has a power rating of +4. Not that power ratings mean anything to me, but it’s working perfectly now. (Which is why you can even see this page!) But I still didn’t get a new cable modem. The cable tech claimed they used those during beta testing of RR service, but it was given to me when I got service. He asked my wife if we had gotten at Circuit City, and she laughed and said she was positive we hadn’t.</p>
<p>Fazin fixed the music server page not loading yesterday, so now I’m really happy.</p>

            <description>So I was close.
Couch gone. Both Ford &amp;amp; Vines gone.
Kept both kickers, good. Jenkins made it.
This R-Kal Truluck guy they traded a 5th and 6th rounder, better be good.
I’m not suprised Kenny Holmes and Larry Smith got cut. Holmes scared me with his injuries after the fiasco of Joe Johnson.
Good to see the practice squad flesh out with Scott Wells, Scott McBrien, and Kelvin Kight.</description>

            <description>Today’s the day the Packers have to get to the NFL mandated 53 player roster.
The only roster spots I’m really interested in:
Cut Couch. He’s not the QB of the future. Cut your losses now.
Keep Sander. He’s kicked pretty darn bad, but only keep 2 QBs, keep Barker for the first 4 weeks of the season, then cut Barker and keep Sander.
Keep Cullen Jenkins.
Keep Scottie Vines, cut Carl Ford (poor Carl, after such a great camp a year ago too).</description>

            <description>Badgers looked good today in QB’s John Stocco’s debut. The ESPN crew touched on his story briefly: After passing Matt Schabert last year on the depth chart to #2 behind Jim Sorgi, John was a bit shy and uncomfortable replacing Matt, who was also his roommate. After being demoted to #3, Matt left Wisconsin for a Division I-AA school this year, where he could be the starting QB.
Anthony Davis looked good, until getting hurt, again.</description>

After being demoted to #3, Matt left Wisconsin for a Division I-AA school this year, where he could be the starting QB.</p>
<p>Anthony Davis looked good, until getting hurt, again. Booker Stanley was so-so at RB. The new defensive coordinator’s scheme seemed to work, but nothing stood out about it. Not a lot of blitzing, and Scott Starks at CB will never start in the NFL.</p>
<p>I had told my dad this morning I would be happy to see the Badgers run up the score on University of Central Florida, as they are now the home to disgraced coach George O’Leary. I made the remark because after O’Leary was forced to resign at Notre Dame he spent 2 years on Mice Tice’s staff at the Minnesota Vikings, with the second year as defensive coordinator. Turn on the game today, and O’Leary isn’t even at the game as he’s attending his mother’s funeral. Oops.</p>
<p>Badgers should have a good year. If Stocco emerges in the mold of how Trent Dilfer played for Baltimore a few years back, as a steady, mistake free QB who doesn’t have to put up big yards, the Badgers could make a run at things. With Ohio State and Michigan struggling early in their wins today, there may be hope yet!</p>

            <description>The Minneapolis Star Tribune has an article this morning about the city of Chaska’s wireless broadband service for $16. Discussed previously in USA Today and Slashdot, I’ve looked into it, but I don’t think it’s for me.
It’s more than half off of Sprint DSL, and almost 2/3 less than Time Warner’s Roadrunner service. I’ve had Roadrunner since it launched in Chaska 4 years ago, and it’s been rock steady. I used to average 2.</description>

<p>It’s more than half off of Sprint DSL, and almost 2/3 less than Time Warner’s Roadrunner service. I’ve had Roadrunner since it launched in Chaska 4 years ago, and it’s been rock steady. I used to average 2.5 megs down, and recently they upped it to 3.5 down. With Chaska.net offering 800k – 1.2 megs down, the reliability, but more importantly (as a gamer) the speed of RR will keep me with RR’s service.</p>
<p>Chaska.net does give me hope for the future, as more cities in the U.S. adopt this model and can make broadband affordable for everyone.</p>

            <description>And the music server is back!
At a slightly different address, but symlinks worked perfectly.
I’m still using Netjuke to power the site. I’m disappointed, the developers have been promising Netjuke 2, with a tentative date of July 15th which came and went without a peep. Love Netjuke 1, I’m just disappointed they haven’t communicated anything yet.</description>

6 last week – gone. Less than a week later, 6 more. Use one yesterday, today I have 6 again.

            <description>Tomorrow, Clerks X is released on DVD. This 10th anniversary edition of Kevin Smith’s Clerks is the definitive version of the movie including the original cut of the film shown at the Sundance Film Festival, as well as the version released in theaters.
But wait, there’s more! Kevin Smith has been hinting that he would be doing a “small project” prior to Green Hornet. And it’s a sequel to Clerks, tentatively titled “The Passion of the Clerks”.</description>

            <description>The server’s back. And better than before. 340 gigs of loving, properly configured this time so if I have to replace the OS the data should stay (well, most of it).
Highlights of getting the server (silwenae.net) back online:
DHCP working
Firewall working
Basic homepage up
My blog up
Messed around for hours with my blog trying to import b2evo into WordPress. No go.
Messed around some more with styles for my blog.</description>

I submitted the MSNBC interview link to Slashdot on Friday about Opus, but they didn’t take mine, and posted someone elses yesterday. And it was my first ever submission too! At least I had mod points at the time.</description>

            <description>I think Inside the Actor’s Studio has jumped the shark.
I have my TiVo set to record all of the new episodes, and the latest one with the cast of Will &amp;amp; Grace, was disappointing.
About 6 months ago, NBC bought out Bravo (as you can see from the re-airings of West Wing, Boomtown, and the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy partnership).
If NBC hadn’t bought Bravo, would we have seen the cast of Will &amp;amp; Grace on Inside the Actor’s Studio?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/">Inside the Actor’s Studio</a> has jumped the shark.</p>
<p>I have my TiVo set to record all of the new episodes, and the latest one with the cast of Will &amp; Grace, was disappointing.</p>
<p>About 6 months ago, NBC bought out Bravo (as you can see from the re-airings of West Wing, Boomtown, and the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy partnership).</p>
<p>If NBC hadn’t bought Bravo, would we have seen the cast of Will &amp; Grace on Inside the Actor’s Studio? Probably not. As one of the anchor’s for NBC’s Must See TV Thursday night, and soon to be “the” anchor with the demise of Friends after this season, I believe NBC used the Actor’s Studio to help position Will &amp; Grace.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the show during the interviews, James Lipton even introduces the President of Bravo (and VP of NBC) who is sitting in the audience.</p>
<p>The show itself wasn’t bad – I might not care for Will &amp; Grace, but with the 4 lead actors they also had the two main writers, and James Burroughs (director). It was interesting to hear them talk and James Burroughs is an icon himself, with his work on Taxi, and directing 75% of all Cheers episodes.</p>
<p>I can appreciate NBC flexing their marketing muscle. And I understand why they purchased Bravo. But I think it’s unfortunate that the one show that should have remained pure and free from marketing bias was affected.</p>
<p>(And I’m still waiting for the anniversary episode that Will Ferrell referred to on Dinner for Five on IFC – where Will Ferrell (as James Lipton) interviews James Lipton!)</p>

            <description>PvP, an online comic I read written by Scott Kurtz, summed up my reactions to Matrix: Revolutions perfectly.
You can read his rant / review / comments here.
Don’t read it if you haven’t seen the movie, you might spoil something.</description>

            <description>Took Alex to his first college football game yesterday, Badgers vs Gophers at the Metrodome. Gophers won on a last second field goal, but Alex had a ball. Pretty good seats, corner end zone, upper deck, so we had a nice clear view of the field.
I had as much fun watching Alex and his reactions to the game as I did watching the game. Great football game (even if the wrong team won) – Badgers stormed back in the second half, Alvarez had a gutsy time out call on the Gophers last drive, but it wasn’t meant to be.</description>

            <description>So I missed the news last month, but the BBC had a press release on Oct 14th that Coupling is coming back for a 4th season.
I never could make the transition from the (much better) BBC version to NBC’s version.
NBC’s version got the axe this week. Done. Caput. Over with. Oh well. The worst part about it is the perception problem that “Coupling’ is bad – when the BBC version is absolutely hilarious.</description>

            <description>One of my favorite parts of Nick Hornby’s great book, High Fidelity (and the movie adaption with John Cusack was pretty good too, but his books are better), are his Top 5 lits.
So here’s my first one. Inspiration hit me last night when flipping through the radio dial (If I hear Coldplay’s new live song one more time….) and I heard Prince’s Purple Rain.
Here we go, Top 5 Albums (yes, I said albums, this is the 80’s, and I’m talking a complete record here, not one with just 2 good songs, in no particular order:</description>

            <description>Back home after traveling 2 out of the last 3 weeks. And the last 3 weekends in a row.
Florida was nice. 80 every day. I could get used to that.
Messed around with Netjuke a bit last night to see if I could get downloading to finally worked. Installed gzip on Apache. The good news, you can now d/l one file at a time. The bad news, you can’t d/l more than one file at a time.</description>

<p>Looking at the gzip log files, it appeared to be an Internet Explorer thing (ha, there’s a surprise). IE 5.5 doesn’t read gzip encoded web pages right, nice bug. The pages are loading a lot faster though in IE and Mozilla, so a part of it is working right.</p>
<p>But in Mozilla, I couldn’t d/l multiple files either, so I think I need to play with my Apache configuration. (Ugh).</p>
<p>So I’ll add that to my to-do list, which keeps growing. And growing. And growing.</p>

            <description>So the 3rd season of Alias has started, and it’s now Alias v3.0. Let’s recap:
1st season: Sidney works for SD-6, where everyone thinks they’re a supersecret subset of the CIA. They’re actually terrorists.
2nd Season: Sidney, having become a double-agent for the CIA in Season One like her father, still works for SD6.
In January, having the post-Superbowl timeslot, Alias v2.0 comes out. SD-6 is dismantled, and Sidney now works for the CIA (still) as a regular agent, with her father, and now, her love interest / handler Vaughn.</description>

<p>In January, having the post-Superbowl timeslot, Alias v2.0 comes out. SD-6 is dismantled, and Sidney now works for the CIA (still) as a regular agent, with her father, and now, her love interest / handler Vaughn.</p>
<p>Season Finale: Blow up Alias and start over for Season 3, v3.0. Sidney has a climatic battle with her former best friend (who had been replaced with a double), and at the end of the show wakes up and two years have gone by unknown to her, with Vaughn breaking the news to her. And he’s now married.</p>
<p>3rd Season (now 2 episodes in) Alias v3.0</p>
<p>Thoughts so far: I was pretty annoyed with blowing it up at the end of the second season, after they had just done it. Said I’d give it one more change. (Ok, be real, who can’t watch Jennifer Garner?) I agree with critics / ratings that the show was too serial and hard for new people to jump into who hadn’t seen it before. The show still has that challenge, in my opinion. But it is a little less action oriented so far.</p>
<p>Things that irk me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After being gone for 2 years, not only is Sydney an agent again, but she’s already out in the field. (I know, her mystery is central to the plot again).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the first episode this season, she goes rogue and gets the item the CIA wants. She uses this to get her father out of false imprisonment he’s been in for a year since she was gone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her father is a senior agent again already. After being gone for a year in lockup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another love triangle. Last year, it was Will and Vaughn. Will is now in the Witness Protection Program (good excuse since he’s not on the show anymore I suppose). Now it’s Sydney, Vaughn, Vaughn’s new wife (who is the NSC liasion to the CIA in their office). Oh, and Vaughn had left to be a French teacher. He’s back in the CIA now. And saved Sydney on the second episode.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, it’s a well-written, tight show. I just wish they’d stick with a plot line. But I do understand that as good as it is, it hasn’t pulled in the amount of viewers ABC has hoped for. Let’s hope this formula works (this time).</p>

            <description>Speaking of Yahoo Radio yesterday, what a disappointing service.
From a broadcast perspective, it’s gotten better. It used to be when they cut to commercial, it was dead air with no sound. Now you get local commercials.
But I’m a geek – I use Red Hat 9 on the box I listen to the game on. Well, doesn’t work with Linux. Fine. Use the KVM and pull up the other Windows box.</description>

<p>But I’m a geek – I use Red Hat 9 on the box I listen to the game on. Well, doesn’t work with Linux. Fine. Use the KVM and pull up the other Windows box. Fire up Mozilla Firebird and go back and try and load it and Yahoo tells me I’m not running the right OS again. Takes me a few minutes to realize that I’m running the right OS, just not the right browser. Fire up IE, and bam, get the popup to choose RealOne or WMP as my player. Their OS / player detection page needs to define better the problem. And they should at least be Mozilla compliant. (Hmm, just thought of putting the plugin information in for WMP, but I don’t think that would fix it anyway).</p>
<p>And how about those Colts last night? By the definition of the Leaping rule as Al Michaels read on TV, Simeon Rice did break the rule – even if he landed late. But even to that point, for the Colts to score 3 TDs in 3:44, on the <strong>Bucs Defense</strong>, is amazing.</p>
<p>Sitting around watching the game last night, we all looked at each other and said this was a defining moment for Peyton Manning – and it was. Good for Dungy, especially after how the Glazers screwed him.</p>

            <description>Caught the Badgers on Yahoo Radio this weekend. Good win, but they should have been able to stop Penn State better.
On to Ohio State this weekend at Camp Randall. I’ll be there with bells on!
The Packer game was absolutely beautful yesterday. Had a chance to to walk around Lambeau, saw the Atrium, which is gorgeous. The weather was awesome – 55 degrees, sunny, not a cloud in sight. And the Pack dominated Coach Holmgren’s Seahawks.</description>

<p>So one undefeated team down, and one to go… the Chiefs. Dante Hall has to be my pick for MVP so far this season. Let’s hope the Chiefs are looking past the Pack. I’ll be there again for another full football weekend! Go Pack!</p>

            <description>Finally the jinx is broken with the Pack and Badgers winning in the same weekend (only took them a month!)
Ahman green dominated Chicago as the Green &amp;amp; Gold spoiled the new grand opening of Soldier Field.
Now let’s see if the Pack can keep it up against the Seahawks and Chiefs over the next 2 weeks – and I’ll be there to cheer them on!</description>

Using the latest beta firmware (1.40a), and the Neuros Database Manager, an open source Java interface for the Neuros, Ogg files seem to be working fine.
Pretty darn cool.
Now I just have to:
 Mow the grass with the 128mb player today Get the 20GB Backpack working Load it for my trip to Columbus this week Get MyFi working for my drive to Green Bay next weekend Listen to Oggs!</description>

            <description>Still trying to get IcculusNews to work for the frontpage of Silwenae.net… Kelly helped take a look at it, but we need to look at it again so I can mail the email list to see if the problem with the daemon can be fixed.
I’m going to try to install IcculusFinger this weekend, it’s better documented, so we’ll see what happens.
If you use my music site, the new Quintessential 4.</description>

<p>I’m going to try to install IcculusFinger this weekend, it’s better documented, so we’ll see what happens.</p>
<p>If you use my music site, the new <a href="http://www.quinnware.com">Quintessential</a> 4.02 didn’t stream Ogg correctly. I worked with the developer, and the new Ogg input plugin fixes the bug for streaming Ogg. <a href="http://www.quinnware.com/list_plugins.php?type=input">Get it here</a>. Just a self-extracting exe file that will update Quintessential for you.</p>
<p>Set up a blog here for Alex (as you can see at the top of the page). Now I have to show him how to use it. It will be interesting to see how fast a 7 year old picks it up.</p>
<p>I was thinking about that, and when I got my first computer. (We had a Timex Sinclair – 2 of ’em eventually). I think I was about 7 or 8 when we first picked that up. I remember getting computer magazines and coding machine language by hand to play Breakout. (Which probably explains my addiction to <a href="http://lgames.sourceforge.net/index.php?project=LBreakout2">lbreakout2</a> on Linux). <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I did purchase an original Timex Sinclair off Ebay last year along with an Apple //c and monitor. Gotta get that basement finished so I can set up my mini-museum of computers I used growing up. Just have to find a 286 at some point as well. And maybe a P100 at some point (had a Packard Bell once we could afford a computer, and that upgrade cycle with it started all of my learning…)</p>

            <title>BBC – Dr. Who &amp; Coupling</title>

            <description>So the good news: The Daily Telegraph is reporting that the BBC is bringing back Dr. Who. That’s great news. It will be interesting to see if they use any CGI in it now – and let the debate begin on who the next Doctor will be.
And the bad news: Tried to watch Coupling last night. I lasted 5 minutes. It’s hard enough to get past the look of the actors being different from the BBC Coupling.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So the good news: The Daily Telegraph <a href="http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/09/26/nwho26.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2003/09/26/ixhome.html">is reporting</a> that the BBC is bringing back Dr. Who. That’s great news. It will be interesting to see if they use any CGI in it now – and let the debate begin on who the next Doctor will be.</p>
<p>And the bad news: Tried to watch Coupling last night. I lasted 5 minutes. It’s hard enough to get past the look of the actors being different from the BBC Coupling. The lines are the same – but they are delivered in such a different way.</p>
<p>I was impressed with the look of the set, very true to the original series. But the guy playing Jeff – one of the best things about the original Coupling is Jeff, not only the way he looks, but his quirkiness just seemed to be zapped out of him by the NBC version.</p>
<p>Ah well. Just can’t adapt to the change, I guess.</p>

            <description>The Digital Bits, one of the better DVD news sites on the web, is reporting in their Rumor Mill that the Star Wars Trilogy (Episodes IV – VI) will hit DVD for Christmas next year.
They report that Lucasfilm is so happy with the upcoming Indy box set, they want to do something quite similar (3 movies plus one extras disc).
According to the Digital Bits: “We’ve heard from a number of industry sources we trust (and who have proven their reliability in the past) in the last few weeks.</description>

<p>And these are the re-released Special Edition forms of the movie — according to Lucasfilm, the originals don’t even exist anymore. Which, if true, is a shame, but I do understand Lucas’ wish for a definitive vision of his movies. (Even if Greedo shoots first now). It’s too bad they haven’t been preserved for history’s sake.</p>

All hail the return of Opus!
Berkely Breathed, creator of Bloom County and Outland, is returning to Sunday comic’s with a new Sunday weekly this coming November.
2 years ago I started collecting all of the Bloom County books. Out of print, Berke never licensed them to keep printing (unlike Bill Waterson with Calvin &amp;amp; Hobbes). He had his reasons, and I respect them, but it was amazing re-reading them and seeing how many topics are still relevant – especially with the current administration.</description>

            <description>I’m updating silwenae.net, I’ve come to a compromise with myself.
I’m going to keep the blog software, but not as the homepage.
The homepage is in the process of getting updated with IcculusNews. Which has no documentation. It’s a series of PHP pages that calls a Perl daemon. It’s fun hacking at it even if I don’t know what I’m doing.
Thank god Kelly had Perl last semester. I’m going to install IcculusFinger as well, and when I’ve got this all working, if anyone wants webspace / blog / finger ability, I’ll be more than happy to share.</description>

            <description>Did anyone besides me watch the NFL preseason show tonight on ABC?
Britney Spears had to do the worst lip-syncing I’ve ever seen. At one point, she is trying to put the mic on a mic stand while putting a glove on her hand. Her voice / inflection never changed as her head moved back and forth from the mic.
She really looked like she wasn’t even trying. And at the end when she thanked the crowd, there was an almost noticeable pop from turning the mic on.</description>

            <description>The new beta of the blog software works better as they’ve de-emphasized the multi-blog feature and made it easier to tweak.
Upgrade I did last night looks pretty good, I’ll keep it for now.
I did d/l IcculusNews and IcculusFinger. Icculus wasn’t kidding when he said it was lacking in documentation. It’s all Perl, couple daemons that run. I’m going to look into it as I’m still intrigued by it, but we’ll see in the long run.</description>

            <description>I’m kind of frustrated with b2evolution (the software package running this blog).
In the .8 release, they added the functionality to do multiple blogs on one site. This broke my site fairly badly, and the documentation is lacking – but I don’t have a problem with that. This is beta software on top of a base package someone else created.
I did post a help post on their forums and got zero responses, even after searching before I posted.</description>

<p>.83 beta was just released, so I’ll try that. But if it doesn’t work, I’m seriously considering a very basic site running IcculusNews and IcculusFinger from <a href="http://www.icculus.org">Icculus.org</a>.</p>
<p>Just don’t know if port 263 is open… otherwise I meet all the requirements, and having a web page that looks and feels like the old web appeals to me…</p>

            <description>The Packers cut Frank Winters today. With the team since 1992, Frank was the starting center until 2 years ago when Mike Flanagan supplanted him.
Frank was also known as Brett’s best friend.
Ah well, the changing of the guard continues.</description>

            <description>Just got back from a business trip in Phoenix.
Holy crap is it hot.
Hit the road at 6:30 a.m. and it’s already 90 degrees.
Heard on the news that the old record of 6 days in the year where it didn’t drop below 90 was shattered this year – 15 days total.
I need to go back in Dec / Jan when it’s cold here and warm there.
But the resort we stayed at was extremely nice – off-peak in season it was quite cheap.</description>

            <description>64 Bit WindowsXP seems to be missing some features according to MS’s TechNet page
Like what you ask?
Well, just to name some:
Windows Media Player
Digital video disc (DVD) video playback
The System Restore feature is not supported in Windows XP 64-Bit Edition.
Windows Messenger Service
File and Settings Transfer Wizard
If I were AMD, I’d be pissed.</description>

            <description>The Digital Bits is reportingthat the Indiana Jones trilogy has been moved up from 11/4 to 10/21 to avoid competition with Finding Nemo.
Sounds good to me, early Christmas gift incoming!
Bummer the Packer game got called on rain Monday night in the 3rd quarter. But to be honest, we were playing Madden by halftime anyway.
They need their offensive tackles back. Having Favre get hurt in the preseason just isn’t worth it.</description>

8pm, Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio vs. Kansas City Chiefs.
Boo for the cheap artificial turf.
Couldn’t find out if ABC is going to be using their HD truck from ESPN. ESPN has 3 of ’em, and has one out on permanent loan to ABC for MNF. But the listings don’t show tonight’s game in HD… even if it is the preseason, cameraman need practice too!</description>

            <description>Greplaw at Harvard has an interview up with Brad Templeton, Chairman of the EFF.
Good overview of what the EFF is, what they do, and what Brad personally believes in as well as where he came from.
Here’s a great quote:
 # If you choose the three – and only three – most important issues for the EFF – what would they be?
Two of the EFF’s core issues — freedom of speech and surveillance — remain even more important today than they ever were.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Greplaw at Harvard <a href="http://grep.law.harvard.edu/article.pl?sid=03/07/30/1547207&amp;mode=flat">has an interview up with Brad Templeton</a>, Chairman of the EFF.</p>
<p>Good overview of what the EFF is, what they do, and what Brad personally believes in as well as where he came from.</p>
<p>Here’s a great quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong># If you choose the three – and only three – most important issues for the EFF – what would they be?</strong></p>
<p>Two of the EFF’s core issues — freedom of speech and surveillance — remain even more important today than they ever were. But the growing issue right now is certainly intellectual property and copyright — in particular when such areas of law start affecting freedom of speech, freedom to do research and to build software, freedom to publish and reverse engineer, all of which are happening under the DMCA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Greplaw also has a rather tongue in cheek <a href="http://grep.law.harvard.edu/article.pl?sid=03/07/17/181226&amp;mode=flat">interview with Prof. Lawrence Lessig</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, Prof. Lessig’s personal blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was hosted by Gov. Howard Dean last week. What a great read! Dean mentions his thoughts on the DMCA, copyright and other issues. Dean’s campaign also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->has a blog up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the campaign.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>

            <description>So I’m in Madison, WI with my wife last weekend spending some time together, and I tune to the radio to 92.1 WMAD, one of my all-time favorite alternative radio stations. And what do I find? Some light alternative called “The Mix”. So another one bites the dust. In the last couple of years they had gotten a bit harder, but still played awesome alternative with some Limp Bizkit, Staind, etc thrown in.</description>

And what do I find? Some light alternative called “The Mix”. So another one bites the dust. In the last couple of years they had gotten a bit harder, but still played awesome alternative with some Limp Bizkit, Staind, etc thrown in. Almost a cross of Drive105 and 93x here in the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>So I google for information about the format switch, turns out it took place Oct. 29th, 2002. Figures, right about when football season ended and I hadn’t been to Madison in a while.</p>
<p>So I found some articles talking about “it was just an evolution” for the format switch, and other lame excuses.</p>
<p>But then I came across the <a href="http://www.northpine.com/broadcast/index.html">Upper Midwest Broadcasting website.</a> This must be one of the most depressing websites ever.</p>
<p>It’s a site dedicated to radio and TV news in the Upper Midwest (Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota). It details format changes, anchors / DJs coming and going, and ownership changes. What makes it so depressing is seeing all the consolidation. I can’t even count the number of times I’ve seen Clear Channel discussed, and then ABC. Even smaller regionals consolidating to fight back. Whoever said less choice is good? And the number of DJ’s doing the voictracking thing – where they pre-record snippets of conversation from one city and are replayed as if “live” if another city or on multiple stations depresses me.</p>
<p>What’s interesting, and maybe a bit inspiring, is the number of low power stations that have been granted. Maybe there is hope yet.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~mwbp/">Dead Radio Stations Website</a> page. Rev105 guestbook, 93.7 The Edge, 93x, lots of old stations who have their old sites mirrored. Good stuff to keep alive!</p>

            <description>That Howard Dean could get the nomination?
This article at MSNBC sums up centrist Democrats’ fears.
Is it really only his anti-war stance? Many, many people believe that the war in Iraq was unjustified – yes we have removed a menace, but it’s how we went about doing it as well.
As many people learn more about Dean, they’ll find out he’s not that far left. Yes, on the war he absolutely is.</description>

<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/945273.asp?0cv=CB10">This article at MSNBC</a> sums up centrist Democrats’ fears.</p>
<p>Is it really only his anti-war stance? Many, many people believe that the war in Iraq was unjustified – yes we have removed a menace, but it’s how we went about doing it as well.</p>
<p>As many people learn more about Dean, they’ll find out he’s not that far left. Yes, on the war he absolutely is. His health care proposal is excellent – but liberal. His take on gun control is moderate – and some would even say to the right of most centrist Democrats.</p>
<p>But for Democrats to say their worst fear is his nomination and compare that to McGovern, Mondale and Dukakis, that’s a reach.</p>
<p>Let’s face facts – when was the last time a sitting Senator won a presidential election? What do Kerry, Lieberman, or even Edwards offer that’s unique or not a line handed to them from the DLC? And for Lieberman to go on the Today show and sound off yesterday, if that’s not spin, I don’t know what is. Bob Graham has an interesting opportunity, but is he late to the party?</p>
<p>Dean has been consistent. Much more so than any other Democratic hopeful. Yes, he was Governor of a small state – but at least he has hands on experience governing, which I don’t believe the current crop of Senators necessarily do.</p>
<p>I’ll save my Lieberman rant for a later date.</p>

            <description>One of my favorite miniseries from when I was a kid, V: The Original Miniseries has been in the news. Kenneth Johnson, the original writer / director has struck a deal with NBC to make a new 3 hour movie bringing V back.
Taking place 20 years in the future, mankind is still fighting the Visitors when a new ally shows up to help the humans win.
Too bad it’s not a mini-series.</description>

<p>Too bad it’s not a mini-series. I bought V and V:Final Battle when they came out on DVD last year. Of course it wasn’t as good as I remembered it, but considering the first one was in 1983, it’s suprising how well it did hold up. I more than enjoyed watching it on DVD, especially without commercials, and the quality was really good.</p>
<p>We’ll see how good the new one is. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

            <description>Last Thursday, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune ran an article saying Sen. Mark Dayton, with Sen. Coleman, would support the Amendment to ban flag-burning.
I am absolutely outraged that Sen. Dayton, would change his mind on this topic.
So Sen. Mark Dayton has hopped on the flag-burning-amendment bandwagon (Star Tribune, May 30).
Ben Seymour, in a letter to the editor in the Star Tribune, put it best:
 Dayton is echoing the rhetoric used to stifle criticism of our government.</description>

<p>I am absolutely outraged that Sen. Dayton, would change his mind on this topic.</p>
<p>So Sen. Mark Dayton has hopped on the flag-burning-amendment bandwagon (Star Tribune, May 30).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/563/3910875.html">Ben Seymour, in a letter to the editor in the Star Tribune, put it best:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dayton is echoing the rhetoric used to stifle criticism of our government. “There’s something in this country that ought to be above government and all the debates in the parties,” he says.</p>
<p>In a democracy, no idea with broad support is above debate. We should question the motives of these politicians.</p>
<p>It’s pathetic when they return from their dead soldier pilgrimages with “patriotic” epiphanies, which in reality are ill-reasoned, American-ideal-desecrating attempts at popularity boosting, at best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see <a href="http://www.aclu.org/FreeSpeech/FreeSpeech.cfm?ID=9969&amp;c=50">here on the ACLU’s page against this amendment</a>, even Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chief’s of Staff, agrees with me on this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The First Amendment exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but also that which we find outrageous,” he said. “I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cuba jails dissidents over flag desecration. Is this what we have sunk to in the name of “patriotism”?</p>
<p>Email, fax, or write your members in Congress <strong><a href="http://www.aclu.org/FreeSpeech/FreeSpeech.cfm?ID=9969&amp;c=50">here</a></strong>.</p>

            <description>So today was the big vote on relaxing media ownership rules at the FCC. As you can see from this link, the FCC voted party lines, with the Republican majority approving the relaxation of how much any media company can own in a given market. Here’s the highlights from an AP article:
 The FCC said a single company can now own TV stations that reach 45 percent of U.S. households instead of 35 percent.</description>

Here’s the highlights from an AP article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The FCC said a single company can now own TV stations that reach 45 percent of U.S. households instead of 35 percent. The major networks wanted the cap eliminated, while smaller broadcasters said a higher cap would allow the networks to gobble up stations and take away local control of programming.</p>
<p>The FCC largely ended a ban on joint ownership of a newspaper and a broadcast station in the same city. The provision lifts all “cross-ownership” restrictions in markets with nine or more TV stations. Smaller markets would face some limits and cross-ownership would be banned in markets with three or fewer TV stations.</p>
<p>The agency also eased rules governing local TV ownership so one company can own two television stations in more markets and three stations in the largest cities such as New York and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The FCC kept a ban on mergers among the four major TV networks: ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.</p>
<p>“The more you dig into this order the worse things get,” said Michael Copps, one of the commission’s Democrats. He said the changes empowers “a new media elite” to control news and entertainment.</p>
<p>Fellow Democrat Jonathan Adelstein said the changes are “likely to damage the media landscape for decades to come.”</p>
<p>The Democrats said the new rules mean a single company can own in one city up to three TV stations, eight radio stations, the cable TV system, cable TV stations and the only daily newspaper.</p>

<p>It’s another sad chapter in the history of American copyright. Our forefathers specifically granted rights in our Constitution – but never this broad in scope. Not only did they believe in copyright, but they believed in passing that same information into the public domain – not this version of locking everyone out.

            <description>Back when I first really got into gaming a few years back, Slivers had turned me on to VoodooExtreme, as well as a number of websites. Run at the time by Billy Wilson, the site was updated continuously, and Billy’s wry sense of humor had me going back for more.
Well, there was a huge shake-up 2 years ago, and Billy left, and one of his news posters, Apache, who has extensive experience in the gaming website industry, took over.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back when I first really got into gaming a few years back, Slivers had turned me on to <a href="http://www.ve3d.com">VoodooExtreme</a>, as well as a number of websites. Run at the time by Billy Wilson, the site was updated continuously, and Billy’s wry sense of humor had me going back for more.</p>
<p>Well, there was a huge shake-up 2 years ago, and Billy left, and one of his news posters, Apache, who has extensive experience in the gaming website industry, took over. Apparently Billy didn’t have 100% ownership of the site and was forced out (some nasty rumors that I won’t repeat here). Apache had joined the staff about a year earlier, and is an excellent news poster, and very knowledgeable about the industry. Still enjoyed the site, but missed the humor. Their was some kind of squabble over the name, and it went from Voodoo Extreme to VE3D. They had even tried 3dgamingnews.com, but that never caught on. Then Apache even slowly started to fade from VE3D, with occasional posts, and I started to visit less often. (The main guy for the last 6 months sucks – late posts, and way too Euro-focused).</p>
<p>Fast forward to today: This morning VE3D announced they’re now part of the IGN network. Apache’s back, posted this mornings update promising to fix the look of the site, and pushing readers to pay for the IGN insider subscription to not see the obtrusive ads. I understand the business of being on the web is very different today than it was back in the high-flying days of the Internet boom, but IGN? IGN is a watered down, money grabbing internet “news” site that is a jack of all trades, master of none. Their sites cover all the genres, PC games, Console games, movies, and a “For Men” site. I just don’t think hard-core gamers respect IGN, though they can have a few good write-ups every now and then.</p>
<p>It’s really too bad for VE3D, in my opionion, it just shows how the mighty have fallen. I used to visit now only once a week, but I don’t even see that happening. <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com">BluesNews</a> and <a href="http://www.evilavatar.com">Evil Avatar</a> will continue to be where I get most of news.</p>

            <description>Fortune has a great article up about Clear Channel radio.
Lowry Mays, the CEO of Clear Channel has clear ideas about what business he’s in. From the article:
 “If anyone said we were in the radio business, it wouldn’t be someone from our company,” says Mays, 67. “We’re not in the business of providing news and information. We’re not in the business of providing well-researched music. We’re simply in the business of selling our customers products.</description>

<p>Lowry Mays, the CEO of Clear Channel has clear ideas about what business he’s in. From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If anyone said we were in the radio business, it wouldn’t be someone from our company,” says Mays, 67. “We’re not in the business of providing news and information. We’re not in the business of providing well-researched music. We’re simply in the business of selling our customers products.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I’m extremely disturbed what’s been going on in radio for years. When I left Minnesota in 1994, I left behind my favorite radio station ever- Revolution Radio, Rev105. Founded by one of the Cargill Corp heirs, the station never made money, only breaking even, but they played whatever they wanted. When they said Alternative radio, they meant it. This is the station that introduced me to Semisonic (I won tickets on Rev105 to see Pleasure before they were Semisonic!), Soul Coughing and Ani DiFranco. (Ani DiFranco on the radio. It’s 6 years later and I’ve never heard her on the radio again – though I’ve bought all her CDs).</p>
<p>I moved back to the Twin Cities in January of ’97, and after watching the alternative station in Philadelphia die in ’96, I was subjected to it again. On March 11, ’97, the station flipped over to hard rock – which explains why when I got in my car that night to go home I heard Van Halen playing. Only later was I to find out that ABC / Capital Cities bought out Cargill Communications for $11 million and made them sign a non-compete. Now ABC owns all the rock – classic rock on 92KQ, Alt-rock on 93.7 The Edge, and hard rock / heavy metal on X-105. Through the last 6 years ABC has gone from Hard Rock (X-105), to alt-rock (Zone105), classic alt-rock (Zone105), R&amp;B, and now alt-rock again (Drive105) while turning 93.7 the Edge from alt-rock to heavy metal (93X).</p>
<p>The irony comes in that Drive105 has just started adverstising: Not a Clear Channel radio station! But yet they’re Capital Cities, the #2 radio company in the U.S. Playing popular “alternative” music. To 40 spins a week.</p>
<p>There’s not much left on the web about Rev105, though Google comes up with 4 pages of results, not much works when you follow the links. I’ve found a couple though – <a href="http://www.pessimistic.com/revolution/radio.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://www.tl.infi.net/~jeffyf/pages/rev105.html">here</a>. Rev105 will always live in my heart – and my coffee cup! (Which is a Rev105 cup, the only choice for me to drink cofee out of).</p>

            <description>You call THIS archaeology?! — Indiana Jones
The Digital Bits has the press release and details on the upcoming Indiana Jones box set. Set to be released 11/4, the box set will include the three movies (in anamorphic or full frame) and a fourth disc with featurettes.
I’ll have to agree with the boys at the Digital Bits. I was expecting a lot more from a special edition. If they made us wait this long for the movies, they could have at least done it right.</description>

            <description>This almost sums up why I want to sign up for . Vonage, the Voice-over-IP phone company (phone over your broadband connection).
Slashdot has linked to a story done by Forbes (click here to read the Forbes article) on how the phone companies are bilking us, normal consumers, out of billions.
After years of declining revenues, the Bell companies, working with the long distance carriers and the FCC, came up the with the “FCC line charge” item you see on your bill every month.</description>

<p>After years of declining revenues, the Bell companies, working with the long distance carriers and the FCC, came up the with the “FCC line charge” item you see on your bill every month. But in 2000, when FCC auditors went to audit the equipment that makes up this charge on your phone bill, they found that the bell companies listed $5 billion in equipment that couldn’t be found, and another $5 billion in equipment that varied in prices – from $4 for the exact piece of equipment that the same phone company line listed for $133,000 elsewhere. Or $458 for a pair of gloves.</p>
<p>Instead of declining revenues, phone companies have posted an 18% growth in revenues — and how much of that is due to this line charge?</p>
<p>Read the article linked above and think for yourself.</p>

            <description>Oh, the new Liz Phair songs are yummy! Her new album comes out 6/24 and those songs rock.
Extraordinary is probably my favorite so far. The 2nd song listed, the one that will be the first release, sounds a little Avril-ish. But we all know Liz was around years before her, and Liz writes her own stuff.</description>

            <description>Naturally the common people don’t want war neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.</description>

All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.</p>

            <description>I just installed Red Hat 9 on my old gaming rig, and I just can’t believe how great it is.
I thought Red Hat 8 was good, worthy of up a full number upgrade over 7.3, Bluecurve was a step in the right direction, but 9 is really that good. The fonts are the best I’ve seen – and that’s something I had always wanted to update previously on my RH and Debian boxes, but 9 is fantastic.</description>

The fonts are the best I’ve seen – and that’s something I had always wanted to update previously on my RH and Debian boxes, but 9 is fantastic. The software is good and up to date without being scary new, apt-get works like a charm (thanks <a href="http://freshrrpms.net">Freshrpms</a>!), the menu issues were fixed, and the network browser works great.</p>
<p>Just having installed it again, it’s slick, installs easily, and just runs. I replaced my Debian box with it — running a version called “unstable” just never seemed right, though I love Debian, both from a technology standpoint and a belief standpoint. I think Red Hat is doing the right thing in taking a stance on copyright issues similar to Debian with MP3, NTFS, etc. And Red Hat is doing it without falling behind on the applications front.</p>
<p>I can’t recommend Red Hat enough – it was more than worth it to buy a Red Hat Network subscription.</p>

            <description>I’m sometimes criticized for my liberal beliefs. That doesn’t bug me, especially in these times. Without getting into politics, one of the favorite ways to poke fun at me is for my technology views, especially when they’re viewed as paranoia. (See the links on right hand side of Silwenae.com.)
However, there is a story up at Kuro5hin discussing spyware, adware, and digital rights management. The article starts out with good definitions of each and then some editorial content.</description>

While the article tries to delicately avoid all-out Microsoft bashing, there is some, but the article describes very well the state of digital rights today, and some of the things being done to curtail our fair use rights.</p>
<p>So go ahead and make fun of me for using Linux. But at least read the article and understand some of the concerns. While parts of the article might be on the edge, some parts are right on, and these things paint a picture of what could come – if we don’t speak up.</p>

            <description>For the 2nd year in a row, the Wisconsin Badgers have won the Big 10 Men’s Basketball title. The big difference is this year they won it outright (as opposed to the 4 way tie last year).
Unfortunately the game was only available on the New England Sports Network so I was unavailable to watch it. (And what’s up with that? Why not Fox Sports, my regional sports network?) Congrats to all the players and Bo Ryan who becomes only the 3rd coach in Big Ten history to win a title in his first 2 seasons.</description>

            <description>Any man that says “I’m going to put the Democrat back in the Democratic Party” might be my man. Though it took him a while to give credit to the late Senator Wellstone for the line.
He’s been getting a lot of press lately for being the anti-war candidate. I spent an hour Tuesday night researching him and his positions, and he stands for a lot more than that. His comments about gun control in particular were excellent, understanding that gun control varies by areas of the country.</description>

His comments about gun control in particular were excellent, understanding that gun control varies by areas of the country. Other topics such as health care, foreign affairs, and especially fiscal responsibilities struck a nerve.</p>
<p>I’ll be keeping an eye on him, especially considering I’m not hot on many of the candidates, but that’s a different discussion for a different time.</p>

            <description>Saw on Slashdot this morning, some news I’ve been waiting for for quite a while. Ogg support for a portable music player is coming!
About 6 months ago I ripped all my CDs into Vorbis format. Not only is Vorbis a better sounding codec, but it is completely open source. The only two downfalls are: 1. There is no portable player for .ogg files (yet), and 2, most Windows players (WMP, Winamp) have a hard time streaming ogg files, but can play them locally just fine.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Saw on <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> this morning, <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/02/24/037229&amp;mode=nested&amp;tid=141&amp;tid=137&amp;tid=162">some news</a> I’ve been waiting for for quite a while. Ogg support for a portable music player is coming!</p>
<p>About 6 months ago I ripped all my CDs into <a href="http://www.vorbis.org">Vorbis</a> format. Not only is Vorbis a better sounding codec, but it is completely open source. The only two downfalls are: 1. There is no portable player for .ogg files (yet), and 2, most Windows players (WMP, Winamp) have a hard time streaming ogg files, but can play them locally just fine. (Go download <a href="http://www.zinf.org/">Zinf</a> you Windows using people to listen to streaming Vorbis!).</p>
<p>And now this morning, <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/portables.html">the Xiph foundation announces they have signed a portable deal</a> with Digial Innovations, makers of the <a href="http://neurosaudio.com/">Neuros portable player</a>. The Neuros player just started shipping, and Vorbis support is expected in May. It’s a tad pricy, but I’m more than happy to pay for it, and it has a couple of nifty features: 1. It can transmit MP3/Ogg files via FM, so no car adapter is needed, just tune your car to the correct station. 2. Get the 128MB player, and buy the 20GB backpack to expand it. It only costs $30 more to do this than buying the 20GB player outright, and now you can use the 128MB when jogging or cutting the grass, and attach the backpack for the car, in the house, etc.</p>
<p>And last but not least, in the Xiph press release above, they hint at a CDR player coming soon… decisions, decisions!</p>

            <description>I had the pleasure last night of seeing the Tyson / Etienne fight. It’s actually the first live boxing fight I’ve ever seen. (I’ve seen others, but they’re always tape delay). So Tyson whiffs about 5 times, hits a couple, then a big hit to the face and Etienne goes down.
He goes down, and immediately takes his mouthpiece out. What is that about? Then Tyson helps him up after he’s been counted out.</description>

            <description>So we went to see Daredevil last night. Suffice to say, I’m the only one who liked it. It was exactly what I expected, no less, no more. Affleck’s acting was, in my opinion, spot on for a blind man. Elektra was ok, and Bullseye was right on.
Daredevil was one of the few comic books I read when I was a kid. I was more into baseball cards than comic books, and really didn’t even own any.</description>

While the revenge motive was new for the movie to get people going, I thought it was ok, even though it was a different twist than what the comic book had.</p>
<p>I think it was better than X-Men, which I thought was ok.</p>
<p>They’re all signed up for a sequel anyway, so now that we know the backstory, maybe people will accept the 2nd one more. (And the Kevin Smith cameo was good.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</p>

            <description>Why can’t Winamp stream Ogg files correctly? Very annoying. Well, it’s still a step up from Windows Media Player that can’t even play Ogg files.
All Hail Zinf! (Formerly FreeAmp) which can stream Ogg files in Windows.</description>

            <description>Haha, I figured it out. I had it set to: Day (Fri), Month: (Feb), Year: (03) so it spits out Fri.Feb.03. The 03 wasn’t the date, it was the year. I think I fixed it.</description>

            <description>I finally got the RSS feed to work on Silwenae.com for this blog. Added the EFF RSS feed as well.
For whatever reason, the Gadsden Flag post below is dated on the site as 2-3 — but it’s 2/14. No idea why it did that.
Still can’t get the NWN server up. Slivers emailed me some ideas to try. I’ll get to that this weekend.</description>

            <description>I have added the Gadsden Flag to Silwenae.com and linked it to America Live Free. The Gadsden Flag is becoming more and more popular as a way of showing support against President Bush’s attempts to restrict civil liberties.
I know my views aren’t always agreed with – but even under a threat of so-called war, there absolutely no reason to be reading citizen’s emails, opening up wire-taps, and other proposed legislation that limits us.</description>

<p>I’ll leave you with this from America Live Free:</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>We recognize that informed dissent is patriotic, that questioning the government’s actions is patriotic, that demanding that all branches of government adhere to the Constitution is patriotic. For it is the patriotic dissenter who has the greatest commitment to the ideals upon which our nation was founded and it is he that keeps our nation on the right path. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is the time for us to reaffirm the foundation, the cornerstone of our Democracy. It is time for us to rise up and stand for the promise, the vision, the guarantee of what our founding fathers had in mind for us: one great nation of free people, pursuing life, liberty and happiness.</p>
<p>We, the people, stand for the Constitution. We stand for our country. We stand for freedom.</p>
<p>Do not tread on us.</p>
