I&#8217;ve been off the grid most of the weekend, as I took the family home to Wisconsin to visit the in-laws.

My father-in-law has a wireless broadband connection (supposed to be about 1 meg down, but feels much slower). It&#8217;s connect to a Linksys 802.11b router. I&#8217;ve been unable to to get my Toshiba laptop to connect to the net, though my work laptop running XP didn&#8217;t have a problem nor did my wife. My Toshiba gets an IP address and saw the nameservers on the wireless (eth1), but has horrendous packet loss. Pinging google.com resulted in 66% packet loss, and web pages wouldn&#8217;t pull up at all. I don&#8217;t know if it was a Linux thing, Foresight, or the ISP itself.

It has reminded me how much I loathe not being connected. So much for tackling learning docbook this weekend for the Foresight user guide or the blog theme on WordPress MU.

Having some time on my hands, I did do some shopping yesterday, stopping at a [local bookstore][1], who hosted [John Scalzi][2] just over a week ago. I missed him in Minneapolis last week, and was able to pick up an autographed copy of his latest book, The Last Colony, which oddly isn&#8217;t featured on his [Books page][3] yet. The Last Colony is the third book in his Old Man&#8217;s War trilogy.

On a recommendation, I picked up [You Suck][4] by Christopher Moore, which was good and as funny as promised. I finished it yesterday, and I love books that make me laugh out loud, which this did a few times. An odd note about the book: One of the characters is from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, about an hour north of where I am visiting right now in Milwaukee. I was born in Fond du Lac, and most of my extended relatives live there. It&#8217;s fairly small with about 40,000 residents, and I was surprised to see it in a book. (But not as surprised when Oconomowoc, where I am right now, was featured in Cryptonomicon).

I also picked up a nice [hardcover edition][5] of four Philip K. Dick stories &#8211; The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Ubik and The Man in the High Castle. I own a number of his short stories, and since it was featured on Boing Boing, the [Total Dick-Head blog][6] has been a favorite of mine to read, so it was good to pick up a couple of Dick&#8217;s classics.

I enjoy supporting local bookstores, it&#8217;s always worth the premium I pay in my mind. I enjoyed visiting Harry Schwartz Bookstores. They had a fairly good collection of books in all genres, and had recommendations for books by their employees all over the store, which I loved.

Now it&#8217;s off to lunch and a 6 &#8211; 7 hour drive home today.
