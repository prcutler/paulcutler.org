I had picked out the [Silverstone LC16M][1] (in black) case for my upcoming Home Theater PC.

I was pleasantly surprised to learn, via a blog on [Planet GNOME][2] yesterday, that the Vacuum Fluorescent Display (VFD) on the Silverstone case is Linux compatible. Linux drivers, linked from Silverstone, take you here: [to the Imon page][3] that has integrated Lirc support for the remote, and the VFD.

Bonus!
