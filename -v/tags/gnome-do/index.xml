      <description>GNOME Doâ€™s final project report has been released. GNOME Do was originally started as an academic project by a few students at the University of Pennsylvania.
I would like to direct you to page 13, where Foresight and Shuttle both receive mentions:
 Our most recent release was 0.4.2., released on April 15, 2008. GNOME Do now has packages in every major GNU/Linux distribution, and is even installed by default in Foresight Linux and a few others.</description>
