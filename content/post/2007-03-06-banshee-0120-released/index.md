[Banshee 0.12.0 was released yesterday][1]. This marks the start of the stable branch. The last few releases have focused on usability and bug fixes, and active development including new features should now start in the unstable 0.13.0 branch.

[Banshee][2] is by far my favorite music manager for Linux, and is the default music manager for Foresight Linux. Developed using Mono with an active community, try it out today. From [Banshee&#8217;s home page][2]:

> Import, organize, play, and share your music using Banshee&#8217;s simple, powerful interface.
> 
> Rip CDs, play and sync your iPod, create playlists, and burn audio and MP3 CDs. Most portable music devices are supported.
> 
> Banshee also has support for podcasting, smart playlists, music recommendations, and much more.
