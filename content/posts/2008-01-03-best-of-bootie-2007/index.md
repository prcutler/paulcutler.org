It&#8217;s time for my [annual][1] [post][2] telling you to go download the Best of Bootie. The 2007 compilation features 21 of the year&#8217;s best [mashups][3] from the usual suspects such as A + D, Party Ben and more.

My favorites this year (so far, after 3 listens):

  * 11. The Illuminoids with Donita Sparks &#8211; Pretend We&#8217;re Alala (L7 vs. CSS) &#8211; Los Angeles
  * 14. team9 &#8211; Britney &#8211; Dead Or Alive? (Britney Spears vs. Dead Or Alive vs. Daft Punk) &#8211; Perth, Australia
  * 20. Divide & Kreate &#8211; Illiterate City (Jackson 5 vs. Guns N&#8217; Roses) &#8211; Sweden

Give it a try &#8211; it&#8217;s one of the few ways I actually here pop music these days. [More at Boing Boing][4].
