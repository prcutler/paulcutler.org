I haven&#8217;t done an Evil Corporations story in over two years, and it&#8217;s definitely time. The focus: Macrovision.

From their [About Us][1] page on their website:

> Macrovision helps solve the global need for content protection, DRM and software licensing solutions.

Now we all know that I&#8217;m no fan of [DRM][2] or Digital Rights Management, and right there in their company description Macrovision makes it a point to let you knwo that&#8217;s exactly what they&#8217;re about.

Macrovision&#8217;s claim to fame was protecting VHS tapes in the 80s &#8211; did you ever try and copy a videotape from a rental store, and got those rainbow lines at the top and bottom? That&#8217;s them.

Even though it&#8217;s legal for you, as a consumer in the United States, to make one copy for backup and archival purposes, they make sure you can&#8217;t.

The [latest story][3] hitting the web today, is a [follow-up to one from June.][4] In June, Macrovision sent a cease and desist letter to Lightning UK!, makers of DVD Decrypter. DVD Decrypter lets you strip the DRM off a DVD so you can archive to a hard drive or make a physical copy. Macrovision claimed the ability to strip the DRM violated their patents.

Well, the latest story has Macrovision claiming they&#8217;ve bought out Lightning UK!, and sending takedown notices to websites hosting DVD Decrypter. I&#8217;m sure they paid off the original developer thinking if you can&#8217;t beat &#8217;em, buy &#8217;em (ala Microsoft).

This is unfortunate for two reasons &#8211; one, reverse engineering should not be illegal, and in the U.S., under the DMCA, it now is. Two, if the developer had released this under a free software licenses, such as the GPL, the code would be in the wild. Now, due the evil greed of one corporation, we&#8217;re going to lose the ability to back up our DVDs. I know, as the father of 2 (almost three!) children, that I want to back up the movies they watch a lot and put them on a home theater PC. No more scratching and wrecking movies &#8211; which has happened with a few already.

But no, I&#8217;m no longer allowed to. And that&#8217;s why Macrovision is being added to my list of evil corporations.
