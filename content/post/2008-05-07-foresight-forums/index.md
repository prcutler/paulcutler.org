The [Foresight Forums][1] continue to grow!

Recently added were a number of forums supporting International users, including Forums for [Portuguese][2], [French][3], [Spanish][4] and [German][5] users.

Thanks to the moderators of these forums, doniphon and Og Maciel, Stef, Zodman, and Mark__T respectively.

One of the easiest ways to contribute to Foresight is to jump on the Forums and help answer user questions.

See you there!
