[GNOME 2.18 has been released][1]! Congratulations to all the developers and contributors in getting this out the door, on time as usual.

GNOME 2.18 contains a number of bug fixes, updates to your favorite programs such as Tomboy and Evince, and even two new games!

If you want to check out GNOME 2.18, all the Live Media has been updated to the latest release as well, [learn more here on the GNOME wiki][2] if you&#8217;d like to download a VMWare image or LiveCD.

With the new GNOME 2.18 release, Foresight has also released an update to 1.1. We&#8217;ll have the website updated and announcement out tomorrow, but if you want a sneak peak, get it here ([2 CDs][3], [DVD][4]) and install the first Linux distribution to have GNOME 2.18 available, and other goodies too like Banshee 0.12.0 or F-Spot.
