The Twin Cities Linux User Groups are back! After almost 2 years, we&#8217;re set to have our first meeting (except for last summer&#8217;s installfest). Two volunteers and myself have been meeting to brainstorm topics, meeting flow, and trying to find a location.

If you live in Minnesota, and you&#8217;re new to Linux and want to learn more, or an old hand at Linux and want to meet some like-minded people, come join us, everyone is welcome! There&#8217;s a Google calendar link in there as well, so you can indicate if you want to come.

Here&#8217;s the announcement I sent to the mailing list this morning:

> Mark your calendars! The Twin Cities Linux User Group is pleased to
  
> announce two upcoming meetings.
> 
> Please feel free to forward this announcement. After a brief hiatus, we&#8217;re excited to bring back regular meetings of the TCLUG. The TCLUG website will be updated soon with the event information as well.
