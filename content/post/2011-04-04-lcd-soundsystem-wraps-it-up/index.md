LCD Soundsystem played its last show last night at Madison Square Garden. James Murphy made being a DJ cool again in the last 10 years and brought a rock sound and beats to his electronic music that made it sound both familiar and new at the same time. I remember the first time I heard _Daft Punk is Playing in My House_ from their first self-titled album &#8211; a lyric to this day, that if I hear it, is stuck in my head for days at a time.

With LCD Soundsystem coming to an end, [Thorin Klosowski at the Denver Post takes a look][1] at what makes LCD Soundsystem so relevant. 

> Of course, the majority of rock kids in 2002 were still scared of electronic music. For all its bells and whistles, the things it embodied, ecstasy, dancing, beats &#8212; all of those things were dangerous. But that was what was so startling and ultimately rewarding about LCD Soundsystem. It wasn&#8217;t dance music, not like Crystal Method or Moby or even Daft Punk was; it was electronic music made by a guy who liked &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s rock. It was also being made by a guy in his thirties, for kids in their twenties, and that meant the dream of never really growing up was truly a reality.

The entire concert from the last show was posted online at Youtube, but seems to have been taken down now. With that, I&#8217;ll leave you with _All My Friends_ from LCD Soundsystem&#8217;s last show.
