      <description>Just wanted to say thanks for a couple things:
Thank you to everyone in the GNOME community who helped crowdsource editing of the 2009 Annual Report. I received a lot of comments about lots of little things we missed and I uploaded a new version of the report a week or two ago that hopefully fixes everything. (And thank you for the kind words on the look â€“ Daniel deserves all the credit!</description>
