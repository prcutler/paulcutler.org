One of the highlights for me at GUADEC was the compliments I received on [GNOME Journal][1]. After over a year of inactivity, we have successfully revived GNOME Journal, with two releases within 60 days of each, and I have to admit, I enjoyed the recognition it gave me.

With that said, we are working on the next issue of GNOME Journal, which will be a special edition devoted to this past GCDS / GUADEC. We&#8217;re looking for writers! Did you see something cool last week you wanted to share with the community? Was there a talk or an application that inspired you, that you would like more people to learn about? Was it your first GUADEC and you&#8217;d be interesting in sharing your impressions, what you liked, and what you saw? (I really wanted to do an article like this, but I need to be honest myself and the fact I already have 2 articles planned for this issue and other time commitments).

If you&#8217;re interested in helping, either writing or editing, please drop me an email (pcutler at gnome dot org) or [join the GNOME Journal mailing list][2]. A big thank you to those who volunteered to help out with GNOME Journal, both writing and editing, at GUADEC and for all the kind comments.
