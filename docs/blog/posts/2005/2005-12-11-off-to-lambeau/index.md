I am off for a 5-6 hour drive to Green Bay to see the Packers take on the Lions. This is the latest in the season the NFL has scheduled a night game in Green Bay, the previous being Dec. 8th 2002 against the Vikings, which I was also at, and was extremely cold (I was complaining by the end of the first quarter, some Cheesehead I am).
