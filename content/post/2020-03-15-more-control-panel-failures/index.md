Kelly needed to replace the blade in the saw and she cut me a new piece of wood to use as a prototype for the control panel.  (At some point, I'm going to need to learn to use the saws!)  After carefully paying attention to using the right size drill bit, my board looks like this:

![Prototype 4](prototype4.jpeg)

Kelly then took a turn at doing it herself, and hers ended up the same way, so I don't feel too bad.  It's the quality of the wood, it's just too cheap.  The worst part is that the very first prototype that I built upside down was oak.  I couldn't ask for better wood and I screwed that up.

I'm going to move on from a prototype and start focusing on building the cabinet out after a little more research and watching some more YouTube videos. (And hopefully it gets warmer soon so I can work outside!)
