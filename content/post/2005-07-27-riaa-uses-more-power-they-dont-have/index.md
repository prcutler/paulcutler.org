The RIAA has ordered a take down notice to [RPG Films][2]. RPG films is a machinima site that takes animation made from video game / video game engines to make short movies and films. Some of them included music video&#8217;s &#8211; which is where the RIAA had a problem.

How is this not fair use? There is no MP3 to download . Only the most sophisticated computer user could figure out how to seperate the audio from the video, and even then the quality would be awful &#8211; with a video file you&#8217;re trying to compress it down as far as you can to save your users&#8217; bandwidth.

If anything, this probably helps promote more music you&#8217;ve never heard, that will spark you to find out who to make it and go buy it.

The RIAA just doesn&#8217;t get it.
