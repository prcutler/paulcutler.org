I came across a new theme yesterday, [Relaxation][1], that adds a 3rd row as a Flickr badge of your latest photo&#8217;s.

I&#8217;ve decided to give up IE compatibility, and focus on Firefox. This theme, as well as a number of others I&#8217;ve played with, works fine in Firefox (go go standards) but not in IE.

I&#8217;m traveling later in the week, and getting a new laptop as well. Memorial Day I&#8217;ll be home in Wisconsin, and plan on coding the new theme&#8217;s CSS then.
