      <description>There is a Foresight Flickr group I created a while back, for screenshots and conferences. If you have a Flickr account, or want to follow along as the conference progresses, you can find the group here: http://www.flickr.com/groups/foresightlinux/.
pscott has spent a chunk of the day getting Foresight to run on his Asus EeePC – he’s booting Foresight from an external USB hard drive, and had to compile a custom madwifi driver to get wireless to work.</description>

      <description>I’ve read enough of the stories of Microsoft’s takeover bid for Yahoo!, and I hate to contribute more, but Wired has a great story on the Flickr communities’ reaction.
I’m a Yahoo! user by acquisition. I absolutely adore Flickr, with over 4000 photos posted and viewed over 67,000 times. (My Foresight screenshot is #1 for me with 2000 views). I bought a Pro account when Flickr first launched, ages before it was acquired, and was rewarded for overpaying by gaining a year.</description>
