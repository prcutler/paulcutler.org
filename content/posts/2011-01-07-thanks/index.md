Just wanted to say thanks for a couple things:

Thank you to everyone in the GNOME community who helped crowdsource editing of the [2009 Annual Report][1].  I received a lot of comments about lots of little things we missed and I uploaded a new version of the report a week or two ago that hopefully fixes everything.  (And thank you for the kind words on the look &#8211; [Daniel][2] deserves all the credit!)

Also a quick thank you to Baptiste for pointing out a couple little errors in the [Q3 report released today][3].

And if you haven&#8217;t read either, check &#8217;em out!
