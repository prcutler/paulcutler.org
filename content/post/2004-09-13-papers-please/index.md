As some of my friends [laugh at me][1] for my, cough, somewhat, cough, liberal views, it&#8217;s good to see [John Gilmore fight back and win a round][2].

[As seen][3] [multiple times on Boing-Boing][4], John Gilmore&#8217;s personal fight against the government&#8217;s quest to require ID when flying and hide it in a secret law.

The 9th Court of Appeals [has rejected][5] (pdf link) the government&#8217;s motion to file a secret brief to keep a secret law a secret:

&#8220;In a one page order, the Court denied DOJ&#8217;s motion asking the Court&#8217;s permission to file their arguments in secret, allowing only the judges to read their full brief. A DOJ motion to suspend the briefing schedule was similarly denied.&#8221;

[John Gilmore][6] is the co-founder of Sun Microsystems, &#8220;alt&#8221; newsgroups on Usenet, and the EFF with such luminaries as Mitch Kapor (creator of Lotus 1-2-3) and Steve Wozniak (creator of the Apple PC). Still active in technology advocacy, Mr. Gilmore speaks against [copy protection][7], [internet encryption][8], and [drug policy reform][9].
