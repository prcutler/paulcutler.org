Get ready to listen to the same annual cry from the music industry – “The sky is falling!” NPR’s music blog, The Record, has the details.
For the first time, all music sales, when adding CD, LP, cassette and digital – declined as a total. Digital tracks grew 1%.</description>

      <description>Rolling Stone released their list of the 25 best record stores in the United States yesterday.
Minneapolis was well represented with Electric Fetus coming in as the sixth best record store in the U.S. and Hymie’s Vintage Records rounded out the list at twenty-five.
In July I went on a bit of a shopping spree at Electric Fetus, which is also where I spent Record Store Day 2009. There is no question that Electric Fetus has one of, if not the best, selection in the Twin Cities, though Cheapo gives them a pretty strong run for selection.</description>
