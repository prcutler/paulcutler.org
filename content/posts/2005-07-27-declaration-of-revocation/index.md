Our independence from England has been revoked (by John Cleese of all people).

[John Cleese shares the Declaration of Revocation][1]:

> Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories.
> 
> Except Utah, which she does not fancy.
> 
> Your new Prime Minister (The Right Honourable Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a Minister for America without the need for further elections. 

> 9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap, and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.
> 
> All road intersections will be replaced with roundabouts. You will start driving on the left with immediate effect. At the same time, you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables. Roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour.
