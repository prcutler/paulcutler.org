Welcome to Google&#8217;s [Summer of Code][1].

In an effort to give back to the Open Source community, Google is sponsoring up to 200 students $4500 each to those who write code for an Open Source group.

Groups include [Ubuntu Linux][2], [the Gnome Foundation,][3] , [Python][4], [Mono][5] and many more.

[Read the FAQ][6] for more questions.

Students have to work with a mentoring organization, have their code approved and signed off on to qualify for the monies.

Very, very cool program Google has put together. It helps out the Open Source communities and helps teach students computer science, and how to contribute to Open Source. Props to Google and the Open Source groups involved (for listing out the specific bounty ideas and supplying a mentor).
