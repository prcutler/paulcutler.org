                <p>A long time ago, <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/index.php?p=98">I blogged about Rev105</a>. Without rehashing all of that history again, Rev105 is <a href="http://access.minnesota.publicradio.org/press_releases/releases/20041216_wcallaunch.php">being re-created by Minnesota Public Radio</a>. The purchase of WCAL, St. Olaf’s classical radio station, was met by animosity in Minnesota, as MPR bought out the classical competition in the city. But MPR’s vision for the new KCMP is a radio station dedicated to local music. Following the template of LA’s KCRW and Seattle’s KEXP, 89.3 KCMP will have a focus first on the local scene, and then dedicated to playing music no one else does.</p>
<p>How is this re-creating Rev105? Well, their station director is Steve Nelson, the former co-host (with Brian Oake now on Clear Channel’s 97.1) of Rev105, who left after some time after the Capital Cities buyout to go to NPR. Steve was also a founder of Radio K 770, and has been on their board of directors for quite some time. Thorn, KCMP’s music director, was the afternoon drive-time DJ on Rev105. And their newest DJ is Mary Lucia, who hosted nights on Rev105, and mornings with Brian after the buy-out and Steve leaving.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.publicradio.org/columns/minnesota/conversation/">MPR is hosting a blog dedicated to the launch of KCMP</a> as they prepare to go live. No go live date yet, but my anticipation is building.</p>
