[A Gamer&#8217;s Manifesto or 20 things Developers need to do now][1].

> 16. Don&#8217;t use the online capability as an excuse to release broken games
> 
> The first time we hear the word &#8220;patch&#8221; in relation to a PS3 or XBox 360 game, we&#8217;re taking the console back to the store. Filled with our shit.
> 
> But surely the console industry, always more business savvy than their PC counterparts, will avoid making us gamers their unpaid beta testers.
> 
> Chances of that happening&#8230;

> &#8230;again depends on how many turd-filled consoles they get stuck with. In other words, the consumer always gets exactly what they&#8217;ll put up with.
