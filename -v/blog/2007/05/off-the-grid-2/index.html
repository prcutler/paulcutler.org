            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I’ve been off the grid most of the weekend, as I took the family home to Wisconsin to visit the in-laws.</p>
<p>My father-in-law has a wireless broadband connection (supposed to be about 1 meg down, but feels much slower). It’s connect to a Linksys 802.11b router. I’ve been unable to to get my Toshiba laptop to connect to the net, though my work laptop running XP didn’t have a problem nor did my wife. My Toshiba gets an IP address and saw the nameservers on the wireless (eth1), but has horrendous packet loss. Pinging google.com resulted in 66% packet loss, and web pages wouldn’t pull up at all. I don’t know if it was a Linux thing, Foresight, or the ISP itself.</p>
<p>It has reminded me how much I loathe not being connected. So much for tackling learning docbook this weekend for the Foresight user guide or the blog theme on WordPress MU.</p>
<p>Having some time on my hands, I did do some shopping yesterday, stopping at a <a href="http://www.schwartzbooks.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=0">local bookstore</a>, who hosted <a href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/">John Scalzi</a> just over a week ago. I missed him in Minneapolis last week, and was able to pick up an autographed copy of his latest book, The Last Colony, which oddly isn’t featured on his <a href="http://www.scalzi.com/books/">Books page</a> yet. The Last Colony is the third book in his Old Man’s War trilogy.</p>
<p>On a recommendation, I picked up <a href="http://www.chrismoore.com/you_suck.html">You Suck</a> by Christopher Moore, which was good and as funny as promised. I finished it yesterday, and I love books that make me laugh out loud, which this did a few times. An odd note about the book: One of the characters is from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, about an hour north of where I am visiting right now in Milwaukee. I was born in Fond du Lac, and most of my extended relatives live there. It’s fairly small with about 40,000 residents, and I was surprised to see it in a book. (But not as surprised when Oconomowoc, where I am right now, was featured in Cryptonomicon).</p>
<p>I also picked up a nice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Philip-K-Dick-Stigmata-Eldritch/dp/1598530097">hardcover edition</a> of four Philip K. Dick stories – The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Ubik and The Man in the High Castle. I own a number of his short stories, and since it was featured on Boing Boing, the <a href="http://totaldickhead.blogspot.com/">Total Dick-Head blog</a> has been a favorite of mine to read, so it was good to pick up a couple of Dick’s classics.</p>
<p>I enjoy supporting local bookstores, it’s always worth the premium I pay in my mind. I enjoyed visiting Harry Schwartz Bookstores. They had a fairly good collection of books in all genres, and had recommendations for books by their employees all over the store, which I loved.</p>
<p>Now it’s off to lunch and a 6 – 7 hour drive home today.</p>
