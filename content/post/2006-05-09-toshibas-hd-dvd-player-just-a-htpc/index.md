Could Toshiba&#8217;s just released HD-DVD player, the HD-A1, really just be a home theater PC disguised as a normal DVD player?

Sure enough, [as seen on this blog and in the video][1], Toshiba&#8217;s HD-DVD player contains an IDE HD-DVD drive, P4 2.5 ghz, 1 gig of RAM, and a flash disk running Red Hat&#8217;s linux operating system.

As [The Digital Bits noted][2], no wonder it takes the thing a minute to boot up.

Like the blog author above, I&#8217;m waiting for Blu-Ray &#8211; sure, it&#8217;s Sony&#8217;s technology, and their track record isn&#8217;t the best, but the compression and size opportunities (for the discs) are better with Blu-Ray than HD-DVD.
