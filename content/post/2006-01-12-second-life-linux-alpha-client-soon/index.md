Cory Linden [has updated his blog][1] after demo&#8217;ing the Second Life Linux client at [22c3][2].

[Icculus][3] _did_ finish the client, and according to the blog post, there will be an Alpha test soon! Yay! Like Cory Linden, I&#8217;m running an ATI with the binary drivers, so it&#8217;s lookin&#8217; good!

Now if it would just be available in time for the [Lawrence Lessig book signing][4]&#8230;
