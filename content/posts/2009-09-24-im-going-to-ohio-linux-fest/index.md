I&#8217;ll be in Columbus, Ohio this weekend for [Ohio Linux Fest][1]. It will be my first time attending OLF, though I did book a flight last year and had to cancel at the last minute.

I&#8217;ll be giving a talk &#8211; &#8220;An Introduction GNOME 3.0&#8221; where I&#8217;ll cover what GNOME is, how it started, touch on the recent 2.28 release, and what may be coming in GNOME 3.0. I&#8217;ll post my presentation, both the handout and the slides, next week on the GNOME Marketing wiki. (Nothing like procrastinating to get it done).

I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll make a few mistakes, especially as I plan on demoing GNOME Shell, so feedback is welcome. If you&#8217;re there, stop by and say hi!
