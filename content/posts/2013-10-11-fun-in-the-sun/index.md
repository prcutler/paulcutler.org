I just got back from a business trip where we took a customer down to Key West, Florida. Â I&#8217;m not much of an outdoorsman, but we had an event where we went deep sea fishing.

I caught a 45&#8243; barracuda &#8211; the first mate said it was one of the biggest catches he&#8217;s seen in a few years. I also learned I really enjoy jet skiing. Fun trip!
