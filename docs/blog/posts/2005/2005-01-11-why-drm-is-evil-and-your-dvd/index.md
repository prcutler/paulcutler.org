[Cory Doctorow discusses why you can&#8217;t legally back up your DVDs and who is to blame][1]. Suffice to say, DRM, Digital Rights Management, is evil.

[Cory Doctorow][2], European OutReach Coordinator for the [EFF][3], is a science fiction author, DRM expert, and [blogger][4].

One of my favorite authors on the evils of DRM, he once even gave a speech, **at Microsoft**, [on the evils of DRM][5]. From the speech, introducing himself to the crowd, he sums up what he does:
