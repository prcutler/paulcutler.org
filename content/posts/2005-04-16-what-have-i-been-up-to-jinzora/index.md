I&#8217;ve been playing with [Jinzora][1] this week, as you could see in the screenshot in my previous post.

I&#8217;m very impressed. I still have some glitches to work out &#8211; my ID3 tags don&#8217;t seem to be importing correctly, and I downloaded Easytag to check, and they looked right. A light bulb just went on, and I&#8217;ll have to check to see if it&#8217;s using id3v1, instead of version 2. I&#8217;m 99% positive all my tags are v2.

I really like the layout, it&#8217;s one of the best install routines I&#8217;ve ever seen, the album art it automatically grabs and puts up random is cool, and it does everything else. My only complaint, is that it doesn&#8217;t seem (and I&#8217;m new to this, could be wrong) a recursive file scan after the initial import to check for changes. One of the cooler things about Netjuke was I could update my ID3 tags, scan for changes, and it would fix it in the database. That, and the web pages seem to load slow, even on my local lan.

I&#8217;m slowly re-encoding all my CDs after the great hard drive crash of &#8217;04, and doing it in MP3 this time, instead of Ogg. My new MP3 player cheats, and won&#8217;t do Ogg (though it does Napster2Go, but I&#8217;m not signing up for that).
