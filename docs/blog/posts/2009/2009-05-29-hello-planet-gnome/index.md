I would like to thank the [Planet GNOME][1] editors (Jeff, Lucas & Vincent) for adding my blog.

A brief introduction &#8211; I&#8217;ve been using GNOME for 10 years, and I started contributing a little bit on and off a couple years ago, mostly with the [Marketing][2] team on the [GNOME web revamp][3], [Tomboy][4] documentation and also [GNOME Journal][5]. This year I&#8217;ve become much more active, joining the [Sysadmin][6] team, submitting a number of documentation patches, becoming the release manager for GNOME Journal, and spending more time with the Marketing and Web teams. I&#8217;m also the former Community Manager for Foresight, and still active in the Foresight community.

By day, I work for a software company in product management, focusing on anti-malware products for Windows . Away from my computer, you&#8217;ll find me spending time with my wife and 3 children, watching (American) football and slowly learning how to cook.

You can also find me on [Twitter][7] and [Identi.ca][8]. I&#8217;ll also be attending my first GUADEC this year, so please say hi!

I&#8217;m humbled to be here &#8211; I&#8217;ve been reading Planet GNOME for years, and I&#8217;m thankful to be part of the community.
