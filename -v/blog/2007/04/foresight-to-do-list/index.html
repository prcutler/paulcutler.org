            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Stuff I’m currently working on:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/docs/Getting+Started+with+Foresight+Linux">Getting Started with Foresight Linux</a>: A user’s guide to start using Foresight Linux. Currently it’s about 50% complete, but I expect to have it 90% complete by the end of the weekend. Includes installing Foresight, configuring, overview of the most used applications, updating Foresight, getting help and contributing. Feel free to contribute. Long term, I want to convert it to html and / or docbook as well.</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/marketing/Foresight+Linux+Newsletter">Foresight Newsletter</a>. The first newsletter was well received, but was done in less than week of it’s release. It should have content being added consistently through out the month, which I need to start doing, and find a way to get more volunteers to add content such as highlighting a package or doing an interview.</li>
<li>Gaming – Since I did a clean install of Foresight, I need to reinstall my games (Second Life, Quake IV, Doom 3, UT2k4). Lots of Quake 3 total conversions <a href="http://www.linuxgames.com/news/feedback.php?identiferID=9041&amp;action=flatview">have been in the news</a> the last week or two, wouldn’t mind trying those out as well. I probably should add some content to the wiki about gaming on Foresight.</li>
<li>Foresight Calendar – There’s a rumor that a Google Calendar exists for Foresight. I’m thinking I may poke at it, it may be an interesting exercise to add key dates to it, such as GNOME releases, Foresight releases, etc. It may make adding content to the newsletter more structured and give users an idea of key dates.</li>
<li><a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/">WordPress-MU</a> theme: There is some interest in adding blogs to foresightlinux.org. There’s still a question around where to publish the newsletter, though the wiki seems to be working for that, but also to offer developers blogs who may not have their own webspace. First, we’re going to need a theme, so I may hack at that – my html-foo is poor, so I’ve been putting that off, and then we need to get it on the webserver. I’m more than happy to admin it for folks who want blogs. I’ll probably throw WordPress-MU up on my webspace this weekend and poke at it to see what the admin interface is like.</li>
<li>Screencasts: Based on a discussion in IRC on Saturday, I thought I’d give creating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast">screencasts</a> a shot. I played with Istanbul a little over the weekend, and it will work, though the audio quality was pretty poor, and I have a very nice Plantronics headset. A big thanks to pscott for re-packaging <a href="http://www.jokosher.org/">Jokosher</a> and packaging <a href="http://www.pitivi.org/wiki/Main_Page">Pitivi</a>. My current plan is take the Getting Started guide pages on Applications, and create screencasts that match the write-ups I did for the apps. (See the <a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/docs/Banshee+Music+Manager">Banshee page</a> for a good example). I’ll record the screencast in Istanbul, then the audio in Jokosher, and use Pitivi to edit them together. It’s a little more long term, as the screencasts will need to be well scripted, both the video capture and the audio narration.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it for now – I don’t want to put too much on my plate and get burned out, so I’m trying to take it in chunks and stay focused. The newsletter and Getting Started guide are definitely the short term focus.</p>
