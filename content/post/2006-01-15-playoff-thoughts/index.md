I&#8217;m not sure why, but I was happy to see the Steelers win this afternoon.

The Colts have a coach who is well respected, with a rep he can&#8217;t win the big one, but who is supposed to be one of the nicest coaches you&#8217;ll ever meet. They have one of the best, if not the best, quarterback in the league. And yet I was rooting against them.

There&#8217;s something about Bill Cowher that makes me cheer for the man. He&#8217;s a pull no punches, tell like it is coach. I like the trick plays. I like the blue collar feel to the Steelers. I like that Cowher just wins &#8211; and his tenure in the league is as impressive as anything.

Jerome Bettis is pure class as he has accepted his role, and Big Ben, while tip-toeing the line of cockiness, is a hell of a leader on the feel. Troy Palamalu just makes plays &#8211; and he was robbed today.

Robbed! I don&#8217;t know what it was, but I thought the refs in both of today&#8217;s games were just off. From the non-call false start / off-sides in the Colt / Steelers game to the overturn of Palamalu&#8217;s interception, there were even a couple calls in the Bears / Panthers games that just seemed wrong.

Poor refs can&#8217;t ever catch a break.

I was sad to see the Patriots lose, but happy to see the Bears and Redskins lose. (Yes, I&#8217;m more happy for teams to lose than teams to win). The Bears is an easy call &#8211; I&#8217;m a Packer fan, and the true rivalry is with the team in Chicago. For the Seahawks &#8211; meh. I&#8217;m happy for them as it&#8217;s been 21 years since their last playoff win, and I respect Coach Holmgren &#8211; even if he is coaching the wrong team.

Next week&#8217;s picks: Steelers and Panthers win, and meet in Super Bowl XL.
