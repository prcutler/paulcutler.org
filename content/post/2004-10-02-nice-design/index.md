I recently received a [Linksys Wireless-B Music System][1]. The device is pretty cool, and designed fairly well.

Using a wired or wireless connection, you can stream MP3 (no Ogg!) from your PC, internet radio and Rhapsody if you have a subscription.

Fairly good design, including ethernet, optical audio out or RCA out. Detachable speakers so you can even just hook it up to your stereo. But where the block is for all these outs, there&#8217;s still a fairly large hole &#8211; like where batteries should be.

So it&#8217;s a wireless music system &#8211; _as long as AC power is plugged in_. They couldn&#8217;t have found room for two C batteries? Of course, checking the wireless settings and streaming from a PC would probably drain them pretty quick, but still.

The speakers don&#8217;t even sound too bad.

So close, but yet so far in design.
