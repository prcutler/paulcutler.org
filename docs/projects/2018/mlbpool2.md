MLBPool was originally created by Jason Theros as a web application in ASP.net. MLBPool came to an end in 2011 and in
2013, a small group of friends resurrected it as MLBPool2. (Original, huh?) Unfortunately, we weren't as smart
as Mr. Theros, who had created a website written in ASP which auto-updated the standings and the code was no
longer available. This meant we had to do it by hand and published the results in a Google Doc.

In 2015, the same group of friends decided to re-create the league, but for football. Like MLBPool2, the first
two years of NFLPool featured all of the updates done by hand. In early 2016, looking for a hobby, I decided to
learn Python to automate the scoring process and to keep historical records. The NFLPool application
launched in 2017 and MLBPool2 followed a year later. MLBPool2 ran for two years over the 2018 and 2019 seasons before
ending again.  The code is open source (MIT license) and archived on Github.
