One of my new favorite blogs to read, Total Dick-head, devoted to everything Philip K. Dick, [has the details][1] on the next Bladerunner DVD release, via [DavisDVD][2].

I love Bladerunner &#8211; it was really the Director&#8217;s Cut being released in theaters that really got me into it, as I remember going to the Oriental in Milwaukee to watch it, and just being blown away. The first DVD release was pretty poor &#8211; it was basically just the Laserdisc version slapped on to DVD without being remastered, and the quality is iffy at best. Bladerunner is by far the best adapation of a Philip K. Dick story (though A Scanner Darkly is the truest adaption), and the story, the visuals, and the acting were all top notch.

I eagerly await this release on DVD! Read the [details on the 5 disc box set here.][1]
