Two Minneapolis Star Tribune writers [have a back and forth discussion][1]on what they like and don&#8217;t like about 89.3, The Current.

It&#8217;s an above average article, and while I agree with most of it, there are parts I disagree with, though it does give you a good feeling for the station as a whole.

> JB: What I want from a radio station is a DJ I could talk music with. On the Current, I could definitely talk music with Mary Lucia and Bill DeVille &#8212; my two favorites. I loved the other day when Mary said, &#8220;I&#8217;m still loving this, and I&#8217;ll slap anyone who says otherwise. Here&#8217;s the Redwalls.&#8221; And I could talk with Mark Wheat and Jill Riley, who I think is really improving. But for Thorn [DJ Skroch], I think our conversation would have to be via e-mail.

> CR: Ultimately, I don&#8217;t care what their personalities are; I care about what they play. Bill DeVille definitely gets my vote in that department. I did a road trip on July 4th and didn&#8217;t once put in a CD thanks to him. He played sets such as Boomtown Rats with Betty Serveert with Gram Parsons with one of those especially weird new White Stripes songs.
