I saw on [Daily Kos][1], a liberal weblog, this morning, that Clear Channel [has][2] [put][3] up 11 billboards across the Twin Cities saying &#8220;_Don&#8217;t Vote_&#8220;.

According to a Clear Channel spokesman, the billboards are a teaser ad for an ad campaign that will be unveiled on Oct. 11th. The billboards are in predominantly minority neighborhoods. Clear Channel claims that at first they said no to the campaign until they saw the whole thing, which will be in good taste.

No matter what the ad campaign, even if it&#8217;s for their radio stations (of which they have almost 50% market share here in the Twin Cities), this is in poor taste, even if it&#8217;s nothing to do with this years election.

At some point, I need to get my old blog imported here, so I can link back to the stories I did on why Clear Channel is evil, and why radio here in the Twin Cities sucks (Thanks Clear Channel and ABC Capital Cities Radio!).

And don&#8217;t forget, Clear Channel executives have a nice history of giving to the Republican party&#8230;
