      <description>In no particular order:
 Airports &amp;amp; airport security. Food courts and choices at airports, especially as I think they over charge. (Is their rent that expensive?) Airplanes. Being crammed into a small seat with no legroom for ~4 hours, I always seem to hurt my shoulder somehow twisting around. Being out of the loop on the outside world. I find when I travel, and work across the country, between being busy in the office, and then dinners with co-workers, I miss the news on TV and the internet.</description>
