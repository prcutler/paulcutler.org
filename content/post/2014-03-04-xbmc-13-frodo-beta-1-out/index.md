[XBMC][1], the best media center for home theater computers, has just released the first beta of the next release, 13.0 (code named Gotham) &#8211; [go get it][2]!

The feature I&#8217;m most excited about? After adding PVR integration in XBMC 12.0 Frodo, commercial skip is now available for those using [MythTV][3] as a PVR. That, plus the all new audio engine and and a new version for Android devices have me excited to try this out.

I know what I&#8217;ll be doing after work tonight. Sometime in the next few weeks I owe a blog post of my current setup &#8211; [my last blog post from a few years ago][4] is woefully out of date.
