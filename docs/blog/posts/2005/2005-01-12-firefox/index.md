In Firefox news, share has increased to 21% of all browsers. Take that, Microsoft!

I know personally, I&#8217;ve signed up 6 people who are using it now. Not a lot, but I&#8217;m doing my share!

Over on Silwenae.com, I&#8217;ve given Bizet admin access, and he went nuts posting. And I made him download Firefox on his main machine, after he fell in love with it on his backup box. Next thing you know, he&#8217;ll be blogging!
