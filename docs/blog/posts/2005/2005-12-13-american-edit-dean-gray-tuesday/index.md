The mashup artists, known collectively as Dean Gray, [posted a mashup][1] of Green Day&#8217;s American Idiot album in late November.

Within 10 days, Green Day&#8217;s label, Warner Music, sent Dean Gray a takedown notice. Today, Tues. Dec. 13th, is American Edit day, when websites all over the globe host the MP3&#8217;s for download. Not for commercial gain, but to share and enjoy Green Day&#8217;s music, dubbed with other music, to promote Green Day.

Hit the link above to grab a download link, or surf on over to my other website [where I&#8217;ve posted the files][2] individually and as one archive (in tar.gz format).

If you&#8217;re into other mashups, [Lock3down has American Edit for download][3], as well as some other interesting mashups.
