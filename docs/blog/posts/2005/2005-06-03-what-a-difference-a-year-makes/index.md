  This is Alex&#8217;s 3rd year in organized baseball. Last year was the coaches pitching with a manual machine, this year is the first with kids pitching.

It&#8217;s amazing the difference a year makes. Last year in 7-8 year old, most of the kids had a hard time paying attention, hitting, throwing. This year, even Alex, who I don&#8217;t practice with enough, has shown tremendous improvement in the skills department.

He has a fun time playing, and is lightyears ahead of where he was. Tuesday night, the night the picture was taken, he was 3 for 4, including the hit pictured here.

I&#8217;ll group &#8217;em on Flickr this weekend.
