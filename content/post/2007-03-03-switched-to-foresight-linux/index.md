It&#8217;s official: I&#8217;ve switched to Foresight from Ubuntu on my main computer. As I posted a few days ago in my review of Foresight, I&#8217;ve been really impressed with the distribution and the community around Foresight. The community was what made the decision easy. I would have never believed even two weeks ago that I&#8217;d have a different distribution than Ubuntu on my computer, but here we are.

Installed the brand new [1.01 release][1] this morning, installed and configured everything to my needs (Nvidia Drivers, Compiz, Bluefish, etc), restored my data, and I&#8217;m all set. Copying my music over and importing in to Banshee as we speak. I need to learn how to install a development package, Jokosher specifically, so I can get back to creating my first Podcast. (Audacity isn&#8217;t in the repos, as it isn&#8217;t a GNOME-ish application).

I&#8217;ve signed up for the [mailing lists][2], created my [Wiki][3] and [Bug Tracking][3] accounts (and submitted my first bug report), and look forward to joining, and more importantly, contributing to the Foresight community.
