2 and a half years ago I debuted my new haircut, when I just had the stylist use the clippers on one all the way around. I&#8217;ve stuck with that since then, though I&#8217;ve gone no guard for the last few haircuts.

That haircut debuted right before a LAN party in Chicago 2 years ago sponsored by BFG. Their third annual one is next weekend, and in honor of that, I took the dive I&#8217;ve been talking about for the last year, and actually shaved my head.

We shall see what the reactions are this time.
