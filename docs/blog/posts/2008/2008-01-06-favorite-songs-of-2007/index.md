I&#8217;m involved in a CD swap, so I thought I would put a compilation together of some of my favorite songs released in 2007. I had to pare my initial list down from about 35 to 21 to get it to fit on one CD, so some good ones got left off.

(In order of how they live on the CD, not popularity. Artist / Song / Album. Minneapolis artists in italics)

1. Arcade Fire / Intervention / Neon Bible.
  
2. Bruce Springsteen / Radio Nowhere / Magic
  
3. Bloc Party / I still Remember / A Weekend in the City
  
_4. Brother Ali / Truth Is / The Undisputed Truth_
  
5. Spoon / The Underdog / Ga Ga ga Ga Ga
  
6. Dolores O&#8217;Riordan / Loser / Are You Listening?
  
7. Black Rebel Motorcycle Club / Not What You Wanted / Baby 81
  
8. The New Pornographers / All the Old Showstoppers / Challengers
  
9. Feist / 1234 / The Reminder
  
_10. Dan Wilson / Breathless / Free Life_
  
11. Ryan Adams / Halloween Head / Easy Tiger
  
12. Linkin Park / What I&#8217;ve Done / Minutes to Midnight
  
13. The Shins / Phantom Limb / Wincing the Night Away
  
_14. Cloud Cult / Pretty Voice / The Meaning of 8_
  
15. Sharon Jones & The Dap Kings / Let Them Knock / 100 Days, 100 Nights
  
16. Tegan & Sara / Nineteen / The Con
  
17. The Donnas / Save Me / Bitchin&#8217;
  
18. Ted Leo & The Pharmacists / Who Do You Love / Living With the Living
  
19. Lily Allen / Friday Night / Alright, Still
  
20. The View / Same Jeans / Hats Off to the Buskers
  
21. Rilo Kiley / Give a Little Love / Under the Blacklight

A few of the artists who came close, but didn&#8217;t make the final cut:

  * Chris Cornell
  * Yeah Yeah Yeahs
  * Modest Mouse
  * Joseph Arthur & the Lonely Astronaugts
  * LCD Soundsystem
  * Arctic Monkeys
  * Tori Amos
