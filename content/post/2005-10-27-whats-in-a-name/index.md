I&#8217;ve received a number of questions over the years of where the name &#8220;Silwenae&#8221; came from. It was randomly generated in Everquest &#8211; the second name I chose within EQ. It was unique enough that I stuck with it, including registering 3 domains. (And for the record, it&#8217;s pronounced _sill-win-ay)_.

CmdrTaco, co-founder of [][1], has [written an op-ed piece on Slashdot][2] on how Blizzard made him change his name due to the use of &#8220;Cmdr&#8221;, a title, in his World of Warcraft name, and how it&#8217;s affected him.

Online persona&#8217;s are interesting &#8211; there is a lack of accountability in using a handle for your pixels. There&#8217;s safety in anonymity. It wasn&#8217;t until recently I even put my real name on my blog &#8211; not out of safety, but out of privacy. (Though smart interweb people just look at Internic to see who owns a domain, and I&#8217;ve never faked that). I grew up on BBS&#8217;s, and using popular characters from books I liked &#8211; and I see that trend every day online (how many Drizzt&#8217;s did you see back in the EQ days?)

What does an online handle mean to you?
