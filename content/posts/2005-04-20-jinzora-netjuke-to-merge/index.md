So I leave for a business trip for a week, and halfway through I finally check the &#8216;net for news, and what do I see?

[Jinzora][1] and [Netjuke][2] are [merging efforts][3] to create an even better music management web tool.

While kind of cool, I&#8217;m glad to see the Jinzora team in firm control &#8211; their release cycle and active development is why so many Netjuke users have jumped ship from Netjuke to Jinzora. Blake Waters, the lead developer of Netjuke, has been busy for the last 2 years on other projects, leading to Netjuke development stalling.

I&#8217;m glad Jinzora 2 has been released, and under the GPL. I have concerns about Netjuke&#8217;s future, as they wanted to get away from the GPL, and possibly even charge for the software. I&#8217;m hoping Jinzora stays on the path they have so far, and away from where Netjuke had thought about going. And Netjuke&#8217;s requirement for 2.0 for PHP5 was disconcerting &#8211; I understand wanting to use latest and greatest versions of software, but even Ubuntu doesn&#8217;t support PHP5 yet.

I look forward to the teams working together.

Thanks to Jamie for the heads up on [my forums][4].
