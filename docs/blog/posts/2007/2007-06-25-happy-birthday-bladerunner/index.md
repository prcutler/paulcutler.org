[Today is the 25th anniversary][1] of [Bladerunner][2]. To celebrate, I&#8217;m off to watch the movie on the big TV with my laptop in tow to get some work done.

I was only 9 when this was released, but I still vividly remember seeing the re-release in 1992 at the [Oriental Theater][3] in Milwaukee when the Director&#8217;s Cut was released. I love everything about this movie, and can&#8217;t wait for the box set later this year.

I&#8217;m still working my way through the [Library of America collection of Philip K. Dick novels][4]. I&#8217;ve read The Man in the High Castle and The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch so far. I&#8217;m looking forward to Ubik and re-reading Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, the story Bladerunner is based on.
