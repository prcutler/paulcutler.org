[Flickr][1] has finally begun to offer online printing of photo&#8217;s (if you&#8217;re in the U.S.). They have a [FAQ][2] up, and prices appear to start at $0.20 for 4&#215;6 and go up from there, so it&#8217;s competitive. Looking at the [Flickr Blog][3], I see they&#8217;re also available for in-store pickup at Target. Very smart.

What&#8217;s interesting, is you, as the photo owner, can limit who can order prints from your photo&#8217;s. I never thought of that &#8211; I would have assumed it was just for the user, but when combined with a copyleft model, that&#8217;s pretty darn cool.
