I don&#8217;t blog politics much, though I&#8217;m a pretty passionate liberal (no, really).

DailyKos, one of the more liberal and bigger blogs out there, shared their [November straw poll results][1] for the Democratic primary.

Surprisingly enough, Russ Feingold is 2nd in the straw poll for the 3rd month in a row, after Gen. Clark.

Now granted, DailyKos readers are extremely progressive, but I&#8217;m still surprised. I had the honor of meeting Senator Feingold one Sunday when we bumped into each other at lunch at Dotty Dumplings Dowry (alas, one of the best burger places ever is gone from Madison now) when he was still a state senator. I&#8217;ve followed his career avidly (being from Wisconsin myself), and have great respect for him. Not only is he a maverick, but he votes his conscience. That, combined with how he listens to his voters &#8211; every year he visits every Wisconsin county and has a townhall in each one, Sen. Feingold is someone in the party I have great respect for.
