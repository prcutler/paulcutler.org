[The Register asks the questions about Google&#8217;s new DRM][1] that need to be asked.

Just because it&#8217;s Google, doesn&#8217;t mean they deserve a free pass. DRM is DRM. And now we have multiple, confusing, versions of DRM to muck up our content.

As the article says, so much for your motto, Do No Evil, Google.

If you still need to get up to speed on why DRM just plain won&#8217;t work, [Read Cory Doctorow&#8217;s June 2004 speech on DRM to Microsoft][2] or in [pretty html here][3].
