[GNOME Journal Issue 16][1] is out, featuring 3 new articles:

  * Writing Open Source conference recap
  * Putting the Network back into G(N)OME interview with J5 &#8211; based on his recent talk at GUADEC.
  * Behind the Scenes with Lucas Rocha &#8211; the man who started the Behind the Scenes feature on GNOME Journal

Special thanks to Jim and Shaun for helping edit the articles, and Lucas and J5 for taking the time for the interviews, both at and after GUADEC.

Issue 17 is already being planned as a special edition focused on Multimedia in Linux and GNOME. Have an idea for an article or interview? Let me know, we&#8217;d love to have you!
