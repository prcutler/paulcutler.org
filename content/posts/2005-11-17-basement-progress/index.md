Basement progress is slow, but I&#8217;ve enjoyed the first two days of my vacation.

There is so much drywall dust it&#8217;s amazing &#8211; I&#8217;ve vacuumed, and swept no less than 4 times, and still there is a coat of dust on the floor.

We&#8217;ve got the paint, did some shopping today and picked out the tile, carpet, and maybe some cabinets. Got the plastic and some painters tape, and tomorrow the real fun starts.
