How to make fun of your competitor and have fun at the same time:

[Blizzard announces Pandaren Express available for in-game food ordering][1]. Funny stuff.

But even funnier: [Playing Warcraft 3 inside WoW][2].

Blizzard always has good April Fools Jokes. I&#8217;m guessing they have some in-game events going on too. Ah well, poker tonight instead!
