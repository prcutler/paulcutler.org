After a month off (due to wiki maintenance) the Foresight Newsletter is back! Volume I, Issue 8 highlights the latest security fixes, Foresight in the news and a look at the first alpha of Foresight Linux 2, including:

  * Alpha release highlights
  * Known bugs
  * New editions: KDE and XFCE!

Issue 9 will start planning soon, if you want to lend a hand and write a section, ping me in IRC!

Update: How could I forget to mention this? [Go digg it!][1] (Thanks to etank for submitting to digg)
