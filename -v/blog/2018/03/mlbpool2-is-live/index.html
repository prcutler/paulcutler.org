            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I deployed <a href="https://mlbpool2.com">MLBPool2</a> on Monday. I had a flurry of activity over the weekend to fix a scoring bug. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get MLBPool2 to match the 2017 results that were done by hand. I learned that I don’t have the patience to hand enter the picks for 16 players and then all of their All-Star Break changes. I did it three times and every time I would catch a mistake that I made. And with the way the UniquePicks service works, one mistake is all it takes to throw off the entire score. I also decided to add the ability to add an administrator and let him or her update the database if a player had paid the league fee.</p>
<p>Once that was done, it was time to test my mediocre (at best) sysadmin skills. Adding the server blocks to nginx was easier than expected and it took me a half hour to figure out why the app wasn’t loading – when using nginx with Waitress for the wsgi server, the app name has to be an exact match. (Note to self: The app name is mlbpool, not mlbpool2).</p>
<p>I changed the DNS to point from one DigitalOcean droplet to another and Let’s Encrypt made it a breeze to get a new SSL certificate. (Of course https is served by default. I haven’t been a member of the EFF for 14 years for nothing).</p>
<p>The database hasn’t crashed yet, so I’m hopeful all my <code>session.close()</code> statements are where they should be, though Bing’s webcrawler apparently crawls by IP and not domain and I woke up to a Rollbar notification of an error thanks to Bing looking for a URL on NFLPool.</p>
<p>It’s been fun having Slack notifications for when a new user registers and makes their picks and seeing those roll in.</p>
<p>But the work doesn’t stop there. Yesterday I wrote user documentation using reStructuredText and Sphinx (yay, another markup language to learn. This is only the fourth language I’ve used to write user help.). I created an account on Read the Docs, connected my Github repo, and voila! <a href="http://mlbpool2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">User documentation for MLBPool2</a> on how to create and manage an account, now to submit and change picks, league rules and scoring. This was all just a precursor to what I really want to do, which is write the developer documentation.</p>
<p>I also started working on tests for MLBPool2. I’m still so confused on testing, specifically what tests I need to right to improve code coverage. But I successfully wrote my first test using <code>pytest</code> today – just a small one to check the MySportsFeed API and make sure it’s up and returns a 200 status code. Baby steps.</p>
<p>I’ve already filed a bug and a couple of enhancements that I want to work on once the season is over. When I set out to learn Python to build these apps, I did it because I wanted a hobby, and I sure have one now.</p>
