      <description>Tonight marks the end of Fringe’s five year run on Fox. Created by J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who were the early showrunners for Alias, and would the latter two would go on to write Transformers and Star Trek, which Mr. Abrams directed as well. Fringe began as a cross between the X-Files and Alias, featuring a monster of the week story in addition to the overarching story lines about Walter’s past.</description>

      <description>Fringe is my new favorite TV show of the season, with Life on Mars being a close second. Fringe, created by JJ Abrams of Alias, Lost and Cloverfield fame, is to me, the X-Files meets Lost. (Which probably explains why I love it so much).
Fringe is roughly half way through it’s first season, and most of the episodes have been standalone and self contained to introduce the new viewer to the characters and over arching storyline.</description>
