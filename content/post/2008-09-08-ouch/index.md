I was traveling in Los Angeles when Kelly got a bit of a scare last week.

Jack was running around upstairs, ran into the bathroom, and he slid on the linoleum right into the shower door.

With a cut on his head bleeding profusely, I think Zoe was more scared than Jack was. (Zoe seems to have rolled a high D20 for empathy when she was born).

Kelly rushed them to the emergency room, where they numbed Jack and gave him 6 stitches. The ER nurses were amazed that after 12 years with 3 children, this was our first visit to the ER.

Jack&#8217;s doing well &#8211; since he can&#8217;t see the cut, it doesn&#8217;t bother him at all. Surprisingly, the nurses thought it won&#8217;t scar, and if it does, it will be very small and almost unnoticeable. He&#8217;ll get the stitches out later this week.

I miss all the fun when I&#8217;m off traveling for work.
