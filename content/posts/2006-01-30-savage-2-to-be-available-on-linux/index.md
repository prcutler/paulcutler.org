[Linuxgames has the post and the links][1] with the details.

Savage 1 was an interesting game &#8211; a RTS / FPS hybrid, that actually worked. The learning curve was a little steep, but it was a fun game.

I&#8217;m glad to see another major developer continue to support Linux &#8211; add S2 games to the list of developers doing the right thing like id and Epic.
