It&#8217;s been way too long since I&#8217;ve blogged, once you get off the habit, it&#8217;s easy to do that. Let&#8217;s see what we can do about that.

Oxygenz.net was shut down this weekend due to a faulty PHP script. Based on the draconian rules set up by that webhost, Fazin and I decided to switch webhosts (again), this time to [Site5.com][1]. (Silwenae.org is proudly hosted on [Nearlyfreespeech.net][2], as a backup to everything else.)

Fazin spent all night Sunday transferring the data back up, and we&#8217;ve moved all the content from Silwenae.com to Apatheia.org which Fazin had registered a few months ago and had just been pointing at Silwenae.com.

The data&#8217;s up, including the databases, but we have some bug hunting ahead of us as you can&#8217;t log in to the Drupal site or into the forums.

All of the Apatheia guild stuff will be moving to:

  * www.silwenae.com to www.apatheia.org
  * forums.silwenae.com/phpBB2/ to www.apatheia.org/forums

More to come soon.
