[WordPress 1.5][1] is officially out, so it&#8217;s a good thing I I downloaded a nightly build a week ago to play with it. I&#8217;ve updated the site accordingly, and downloaded a few themes to play with as well.

I like the black, but spent two hours playing with the header graphic in GIMP, and didn&#8217;t really get anywhere. I&#8217;m going to leave the black theme up for now to see how I really feel about it. If I like it, I&#8217;m going to heavily modify it, including adding the links & meta back, probably adding a second column for that stuff, and seeing what I can do with the header graphic.
