Just in time for your weekend reading pleasure, for the first time since December 2007, a new GNOME Journal has been published!

Articles featured include:

  * [GNOME Asia 2008 Summit Report][1]
  * [GConf Configuration Concepts for Developers][2]
  * [An Introduction to the Message Indicator][3]
  * [A review of Gourmet Recipe Manager][4]
  * [An interview with Stormy Peters of GNOME][5]
  * And last, but not least, [a Letter from the Editor][6].

I&#8217;m especially proud of this issue, as it is my first <del datetime="2009-05-01T16:12:28+00:00">herding cats</del> as release coordinator. I&#8217;ve written an article and edited others before, but this is my first one as a major contributor to the team.

What are you waiting for? Go [read it now][7]!
