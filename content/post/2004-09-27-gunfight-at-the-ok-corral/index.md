I turned the Packer game on a few minutes late yesterday. I was thinking that DirecTV would blackout the Packer game as it was the game of the week on Fox, and Fox was still showing the Vikings-Bears game that was running late. So I change the TiVo to the Packer game (after watching the Chiefs lose) and lo, and behold, the Packer game is on Sunday Ticket (much less ranting to be had than last year).

3 minutes into the game, and I&#8217;ve already missed a Manning TD. Thinking to myself, hmm, they must have had a kick return for a TD&#8230; as I watch Favre air it out to Javon Walker for a TD strike. Back from commercials, I see Manning has already thrown one as Favre matches him, and again it happens &#8211; Manning TD, Favre matches him, 14-14 first quarter.

And they were just getting warmed up. 22 straight passes by Manning before Edge even touched the ball. Packers blitzing, blitzing, blizting&#8230; defensive doesn&#8217;t adjust once in the first half as they continue to play a base 4-3 as they blitz and Manning continues to pick them apart. 1st half ends, Colts have 35 points, all Manning TDs.

Second half starts, what&#8217;s this? Packers are in a dime! They adjusted their defensive scheme! Driver continues to drop balls with a few catches, Walker remains hot, Ferguson is non-factor on offense with his injury, but has an great kick return. Packers are trying to slow down the tempo a bit, offense and defense seem to be working. Holding Manning and Co. to 3 points so far.

And then Javon Walker is stripped at mid-field. Colts DB has been lit up by Favre all day, and he makes the play of the game on a beautiful, text-book rip-it-out-of-your-arms strip. Manning walks them down the field, some confusion to get to 2 minutes, Packers burning time outs. TD Edge. Game over.

At one point, early in the game, I had looked at Kelly and said I didn&#8217;t think the Packers would be able to keep up. I was pleasantly surprised in the second half to watch them methodically work their game to get back in it. Alas, it was all for naught, but it was an entertaining football game as losses go. I would rather watch that than the self-implosion I saw versus the Bears.
