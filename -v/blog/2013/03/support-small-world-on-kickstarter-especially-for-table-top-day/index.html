<p>This Saturday, March 30th, is <a href="http://www.tabletopday.com/" title="Table Top Day">Table Top Day</a>! <a href="http://www.geekandsundry.com/" title="Geek and Sundry">Geek &amp; Sundry</a> has organized an international day to support, enjoy and play table top games. About a year ago a friend invited a friend of ours, my eldest son and myself over to have a table top gaming night. I was blown away by number of games now available. You’ve probably heard of some of the biggest, such as Settlers of Catan, but there is a revolution going on in old school games. We don’t get together as often as we’d like, but about a month ago we scheduled it for this Friday night – coincidentally, just a day before Table Top Day, which Felicia Day talks about in the video above.</p>
<p>I’ve bought a number of games to play with my littler two over the last year, most notably <a href="http://www.firesidegames.com/castlepanic.html">Castle Panic</a> and <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/" title="Small World">Small World</a>. Tuesday nights are now game night with the kids, whether it’s a board game, chess or a card game. We usually try and play more games over the weekend as well. I really like that Castle Panic is a co-op game – working together takes a lot of the competitiveness (and trash talking) out, making a more enjoyable experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Small World also <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/online/en/smallworld/ipad/">released an iPad version</a> last year and are now working on Small World 2. The sequel is looking for <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/daysofwonder/small-world-2-the-return" title="Small World 2 on Kickstarter">funding on Kickstarter</a>, with the hope of building a version for PC (on Steam), Android tablets, and iPad. If you’ve already purchased the iPad game, it will be a free upgrade on iPad.</p>
<p>[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/daysofwonder/small-world-2-the-return/widget/video.html]</p>
<p>One of my favorite features of Small World 2, is if the player starting the game owns any of the expansions, you get to play the expansion as well – even if you haven’t bought it.</p>
<p>I highly recommend Small World – if you’re looking for a new take on the classic board game, this game has it all – strategy, quick combat and turns, and infinitely replayable.</p>
<p>Want to learn more? The very first episode of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9QtdiRJYro">Table Top on Geek and Sundry reviewed Small World</a>:</p>

<p>So grab a game and play some board games this Saturday, for <a href="http://tabletopday.com/" title="Table Top Day">Table Top Day!</a></p>
