[Albumreminder.com][1] is a website that can automatically inform you of when your favorite artist has a new album coming out.

After signing up for an account, Albumreminder.com can import a list of your favorite artists from [Last.fm][2] or iTunes.  You can then choose to be emailed the day of release or a few days before when your favorite artist has a new release coming out.  Alternatively, you can turn off email notifications and subscribe to a personal RSS thread instead.

If you&#8217;re a music junkie like me, this can help make sure no new release slips through the crack.  Even if you avidly read music blogs or track your favorite artists, it&#8217;s always nice to have a backup plan.
