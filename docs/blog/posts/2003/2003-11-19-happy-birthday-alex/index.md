My son turns 8 today. How time flies.

At least the baby isn&#8217;t being born on his birthday today. <img src='https://i0.wp.com/www.silwenae.net/blogs/img/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif?w=700' alt='&#58;&#68;' class='middle' data-recalc-dims="1" />

Which reminds me, I need to get her webpage set up so I can upload pictures and stuff.
