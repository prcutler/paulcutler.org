All hail the return of Opus!

Berkely Breathed, creator of Bloom County and Outland, is returning to Sunday comic&#8217;s with a new Sunday weekly this coming November.

2 years ago I started collecting all of the Bloom County books. Out of print, Berke never licensed them to keep printing (unlike Bill Waterson with Calvin & Hobbes). He had his reasons, and I respect them, but it was amazing re-reading them and seeing how many topics are still relevant &#8211; especially with the current administration.
