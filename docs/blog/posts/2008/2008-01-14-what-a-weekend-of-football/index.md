What a weekend! First, the Packers take apart the Seahawks after a costly start, with a game to remember on the Frozen Tundra with the snow blowing. And then the Cowboys, the #1 seed, lose to the Giants at Texas stadium.

It&#8217;s somehow fitting that 10 years after the Packers won the Super Bowl after hosting the NFC Championship game, that they host another one.

Cross your fingers my playoff tickets come through!

Go Pack!
