I updated the blog to [WordPress 2.1][1] last night, which has a lots of little updates. The upgrade went perfectly, and my theme and plugins seem to work without any errors.

I finally found the option in WordPress to update the feed to full posts instead of the summaries, which makes the blog much more friendly to RSS readers. A bonus effect is that it fixes the Daily Links post to post in bullet summaries in feedreaders instead of mashing the post in to one paragraph.

In addition, I switched feed management to [Feedburner][2] last month, so there should be one clean feed for everyone who subscribes, and gives me some nice statistics on who&#8217;s reading.

If anything appears out of the ordinary, let me know!
