The CircuitPython Show is an independent podcast with the people in and around the CircuitPython community.  I host an appoximately half hour conversation with people doing awesome things with CircuitPython or sometimes around CircuitPython.  This could include 3D Printing, circuit boards, and more.

The show will debut in the first quarter of 2022.
