Dear Lazyweb: I&#8217;m looking for a USB Bluetooth adapter that is Linux friendly.

I have two headsets with boom mics I&#8217;ve used on my desktop &#8211; one is a cheap off-brand, and one is a very nice Plantronics. I have been working on a podcast off and on for the last couple of months using [Jokosher][1], more as a test to learn Jokosher so I can add audio to screencasts and help show users how to use Foresight.

Unfortunately, the sound quality on the boom mics is lacking &#8211; the cheap off brand sounds tinny, and the Plantronics makes it sound like the mic is 10 feet away from my voice, and doesn&#8217;t really move on the headset so I can position it better.

However, I just received a [Jawbone][2] bluetooth headset for my cellphone. The Jawbone&#8217;s claim to fame is that they made it for DARPA, and it blocks all ambient noise so you only hear the user&#8217;s voice. My hope is that it might work well for voice recording on Linux. But I&#8217;m not sure how compatible the different USB Bluetooth adapters are for pairing a device like a headset, and I don&#8217;t even know if Jokosher or other applications will see the headset as a microphone for voice recording.

If anyone has any thoughts, please leave a comment here, or drop me a line at pcutler \_at\_ foresightlinux dot org.

Thanks!
