The Linux & GNOME communities are all abuzz with the announcement yesterday of [BetterDesktop.org][1] and the [Tango Desktop Project][2].

Better Desktop has published many usability videos of folks trying to do basic projects, and share those videos to make the user experience better. (Better Desktop is sponsored by Novell).

The Tango Project goal is:

> While the look and feel of an application is determined by many components the initial work has been done on unifying the look of the individual icon sets.

Sponsored by Novell/Suse, it&#8217;s interesting to see them moving forward with this, as one of my constant complaints with SUSE is it&#8217;s KDE-centric icons. Yup, I&#8217;m a user not a developer, so I like my eye candy. I have high hopes, as the team involved crosses distributions, including Novell (Ximian), Red Hat, and Mozilla developers to just name a few.
