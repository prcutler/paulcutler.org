As a Foresight user, I&#8217;m very excited about the future of PackageKit, which was highlighted in the August Foresight newsletter.

PackageKit will be a graphical front end for helping manage software packages on your computer, including installation, removal and updates.

Ken VanDine and Elliott Peele among others are hard at work getting Conary to work with PackageKit.

The new [PackageKit website / wiki][1] is up, and I just finished porting [Richard&#8217;s Docbook documentation][2] (that he [blogged about this morning][3]) for PackageKit to the wiki, [available here][4]. The basics are there, and I&#8217;ve got the ToC and most formatting done, but it could use some help with proofreading and getting the tables set up.
