I [posted to the lists][1] last night to discuss creating a Foresight Newsletter.

The short story is, what would you want to see in a newsletter, and how often would you like to see it published? Send an email to the list with your thoughts, or help edit the [Newsletter wiki page][2].

As far as publishing frequency, the newsletter will only be as good as the content included! I&#8217;ve volunteered to pull it together, and will have a rough draft up tonight for the first issue. Don&#8217;t be surprised if I come knocking looking for more content for future issues too, so collaboration will be key!

I&#8217;m also looking for a volunteer to quickly put together a WordPress / WordPress-MU theme. We&#8217;re thinking of publishing the newsletter on a blog to make it easy to update and subscribe to via RSS, though that part may not be ready by the weekend.

I believe a newsletter is a great tool for marketing and promotion, and keeping users informed of what&#8217;s going on with Foresight, especially for those who may not subscribe to the lists, visit the wiki or IRC, and show active Foresight is.
