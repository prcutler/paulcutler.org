## Winter never ends. {.subtitle}

I just returned home from 10 days in Asia, with a weekend stopover in Japan, staying in Osaka with a day trip to Kyoto.

It&#8217;s cold, snowing and blustery in Minneapolis on April 1st, so here&#8217;s a photo of a cherry tree just starting to blossom in Kyoto, Japan. We were a week or two early to enjoy the full cherry trees coming in to blossom, but there were a few just starting. Enjoy.
