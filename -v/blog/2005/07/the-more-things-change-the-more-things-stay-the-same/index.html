<p>Let me express my disappointment in the quality of announcers on the air in the #1 lineups. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>John Madden: Too old, too much of a showboat, and has lost his touch with today’s game</li>
<li>Joe Theisman: Not many original thoughts, was in the booth to argue with Paul Maguire (who was a much better color analyst than Theisman). Too animated.</li>
<li>Al Michaels: All class</li>
<li>Troy Aikman: Has gotten a lot better these last couple of years. Getting Cris Collinsworth out of the booth with him with only help him. Insightful analysis.</li>
<li>Joe Buck: Stick to baseball please.</li>
<li>Cris Collinsworth: Good riddance from Fox and the booth. Won’t have to put up with you calling Packer games, or on Sunday Night Football. Thank god.</li>
<li>Michelle Tafoya &amp; Suzy Kolber: I really enjoy both of their sideline reporting. Blows away Pam Oliver at Fox or anyone MNF had before Ms. Tafoya.</li>
<li>SNF / MNF losing Mike Patrick and Paul Maguire is a huge blow. I really, really enjoyed the way they called football games. Take out Maguire &amp; Theisman baiting each other, and it was the best broadcast of football weekly, including the analysis and ESPN’s presentation.</li>
