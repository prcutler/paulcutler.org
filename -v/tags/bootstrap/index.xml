      <description>I’ve started my next Python project: Silver Saucer, which will be hosted at silversaucer.com. I originally bought the domain about ten years ago when I was thinking of going into business for myself, which never happened and I hung onto the domain name because I liked it. It was inspired by Neil Gaiman’s poem, The Day The Saucers Came, which I also have a framed art print of:
