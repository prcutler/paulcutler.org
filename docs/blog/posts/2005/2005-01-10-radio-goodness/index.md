A long time ago, [I blogged about Rev105][1]. Without rehashing all of that history again, Rev105 is [being re-created by Minnesota Public Radio][2]. The purchase of WCAL, St. Olaf&#8217;s classical radio station, was met by animosity in Minnesota, as MPR bought out the classical competition in the city. But MPR&#8217;s vision for the new KCMP is a radio station dedicated to local music. Following the template of LA&#8217;s KCRW and Seattle&#8217;s KEXP, 89.3 KCMP will have a focus first on the local scene, and then dedicated to playing music no one else does.

How is this re-creating Rev105? Well, their station director is Steve Nelson, the former co-host (with Brian Oake now on Clear Channel&#8217;s 97.1) of Rev105, who left after some time after the Capital Cities buyout to go to NPR. Steve was also a founder of Radio K 770, and has been on their board of directors for quite some time. Thorn, KCMP&#8217;s music director, was the afternoon drive-time DJ on Rev105. And their newest DJ is Mary Lucia, who hosted nights on Rev105, and mornings with Brian after the buy-out and Steve leaving.

[MPR is hosting a blog dedicated to the launch of KCMP][3] as they prepare to go live. No go live date yet, but my anticipation is building.
