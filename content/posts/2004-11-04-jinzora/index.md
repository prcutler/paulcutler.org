Interesting&#8230; [Jinzora][1], an open source music web management system, [has announced they are working on version 2.0][2], that will offer an option of their normal PHP scripting, or a MySQL option.

A MySQL option is very intriguing, as I may be able to replace [Netjuke][3], which has had one update to CVS in the 4 months as they work (or not work) on Netjuke 2.0.

I&#8217;ll have to keep an eye on this, and maybe even test out the current 1.1 version of Jinzora.
