We had a really good Foresight developer meeting a few weeks ago, and one of the outcomes is to start scheduling week long sprints to accomplish some tasks.

First up, is Bug Hunting Week.

With 2.0 on the horizon, it&#8217;s time to get [JIRA][1], our issue tracker, cleaned up, and tackle all the outstanding issues in 1.4 (and older) and make sure that if the issue hasn&#8217;t been resolved, it&#8217;s at least assigned to a developer.

Want to help? Join us in #foresight-qa on Freenode or visit the [wiki pages][2] to learn more.
