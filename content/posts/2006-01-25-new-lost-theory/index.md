One of my favorite discussions is with a friend of mine about the TV show, [Lost][1]. We each take our guesses of what&#8217;s going on or who is next to die, or throw out a theory of why they&#8217;re on the island. (His is related to _The Tempest_, mine is about redemption).

However, this site offers a [new theory][2], and fairly well thought out. I know I would have never thought of it.

It&#8217;s interesting, but I don&#8217;t know if I buy it.
