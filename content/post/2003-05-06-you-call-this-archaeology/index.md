You call THIS archaeology?! &#8212; Indiana Jones

[The Digital Bits][1] has the press release and details on the upcoming Indiana Jones box set. Set to be released 11/4, the box set will include the three movies (in anamorphic or full frame) and a fourth disc with featurettes. 

I&#8217;ll have to agree with the boys at the Digital Bits. I was expecting a lot more from a special edition. If they made us wait this long for the movies, they could have at least done it right. Oh wait, it&#8217;s George Lucas. He&#8217;ll want us to buy it again and again.

Damn him!
