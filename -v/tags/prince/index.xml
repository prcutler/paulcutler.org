      <description>Princeâ€™s Purple Rain will also hold a special place for me as it was the first album I ever purchased. Oh, I had owned some 45s up until that point, but growing up I spent my summers at my grandparents house, and I remember as an eleven year old walking from their house to the local record store and buying it.
I think my grandparents, and my parents for that matter, might not have let an eleven year old buy the album considering some of the lyrics.</description>
