As a (spoiled) multi-computer user, one of my small annoyances is keeping tracks of my bookmarks on different machines. I&#8217;ve tried the Firefox extension that syncs bookmarks via FTP with mixed success, and a while back I signed up for a [Del.icio.us][1] but didn&#8217;t make great use of it.

Well, now Del.icio.us [built a Firefox extension][2] that makes it a cinch to keep track of all your bookmarks via their service. Use it to find new sites, see what others think is popular, or just keep to yourself and keep track of your own bookmarks.

I&#8217;m adding bookmarks like crazy, and may just wait for the import service to kick back in as it seems to be down. I highly recommend del.icio.us.
