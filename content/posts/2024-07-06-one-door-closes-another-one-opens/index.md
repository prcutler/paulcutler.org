I realized this week that I never blogged the end of The CircuitPython Show.  The show came to end at the end of January earlier this year after 36 episodes.  It had a good run and I still had the itch to podcast, so [Tod Kurt](https://todbot.com) and I resurrected [The Bootloader](https://thebootloader.net) this past March.  We're on a monthly schedule and have done four episodes so far this year with topics ranging from makers and their cool projects or products to 3D printing and more.  It also includes a healthy dose of CircuitPython news if you're missing the podcast.  You can find it wherever you get your podcasts or visit [The Bootloader.net](https://thebootloader.net).

But don't take it from me.  Here's LadyAda and pt from the July 3, 2024 episode of [Ask an Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8X6IXRyBdw) (fast forward to the 1:07 mark):
