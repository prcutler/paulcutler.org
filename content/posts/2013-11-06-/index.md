Why did I buy a [Nexus 5][1]?

That&#8217;s an easy answer.

_**Because I&#8217;m a sucker.**_

I could tell you all the things that are great about the Nexus 5 &#8211; it features the latest [Android release, 4.4][2] (aka KitKat); that the [battery is an improvement over the Nexus 4][3]; that Google has done an [amazing job of updating and integrating the family of Google products and apps][4] into one device; or that the [hardware itself is a major improvement featuring a full HD screen, speedy LTE internet, and a much improved camera][5], not to mention it&#8217;s thinner and lighter.

I bought my Nexus 4 a year ago.  It&#8217;s a great phone &#8211; the glass back scares me because I&#8217;m clumsy and I&#8217;m sure some day I&#8217;m going to drop it and crack the glass.  How I made it a year without doing that is beyond me.  It doesn&#8217;t have LTE, but how often am I really accessing the internet when wifi isn&#8217;t available?  My biggest complaint is the camera, which is pretty terrible.

But the key is I&#8217;ve been conditioned to want the latest shiny new things whenever they come out.  I shouldn&#8217;t &#8211; I should learn to be content, especially as I know I&#8217;ll get Android 4.4 in just a few weeks on my Nexus 4.

I&#8217;ve been saving up some fun money for a while and it&#8217;s been burning a hole in my pocket.  I&#8217;ve thought about buying an Xbox One, but when I finally decided to do that I realized that 1) There are no pre-orders available anymore and I&#8217;ll be in Asia when it&#8217;s released (and will probably sell out); and 2) Sports games are my preferred game and I already own Madden on the 360.  I covet a pair of Google Glasses, but I think my friends will beat me up if I show up wearing Glasses around them.

Between the urge to buy something it really comes down to the fact that I use my phone everyday.  I take a ton of photographs with it and with my constant overseas travel ti&#8217;s always with me.  If I&#8217;m going to buy something, it might as well be something more than a toy that I use a lot.

Combined with the price of $399 and that I can probably [sell my Nexus 4][6] for somewhere around $200, that&#8217;s not a bad price for an upgrade.  But no matter how I justify it, I don&#8217;t need it.  I want it.

The key is that it&#8217;s a &#8220;Nexus&#8221; device &#8211; the Android updates come straight from Google, not the mobile carrier and you&#8217;ll have access to the latest Android for 18 months.  My first smart phone was a Nexus One (I had a couple of Microsoft Windows phones before that, but we won&#8217;t count those as smart)
