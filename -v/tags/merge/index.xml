      <description>Welcome back!
July 25th is a big day for new music. If you’re not reading the Largeheartedboy blog for new music releases, including where you can stream the new releases for free before buying (which usually comes out on Wednesdays), you should be. The list of today’s releases can be found here.
Albums I’ve purchased this week include:
Passion Pit’s Gossamer: If you’re a fan of the first album, you’ll love their second album.</description>

Somehow I went through the 90s oblivious to Superchunk. I’m sure they were played on Rev105 back in the day, but for some reason I just don’t remember them. I’m now making up for lost time.
Amazon MP3 has had a number of specials on Superchunk since their September release of their latest album, Majesty Strategy, their first release in 9 years.</description>
