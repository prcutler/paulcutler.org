      <description>tl;dr: I don’t get testing, but thanks to Talk Python I’m starting to put it together. If you’ve taken both the Python for Entrepreneurs course and the Building Data Driven Web Apps with Pyramid this might help you write tests using the Python for Entrepreneurs code. And if you’ve taken courses at Talk Python, take advantage of the office hours!
I don’t get testing in Python at all. I don’t have a computer science degree and Python is a hobby for me.</description>

      <title>Python Dev Kit Humble Bundle</title>

      <description>Humble Bundle has done it again. They’ve released an awesome bundle of Python trainings, books and tools all for a low price and also supports charity!
Included in the bundle are three trainings from Talk Python (which I’ve already raved about a lot). I’ve been an ardent supporter of Talk Python trainings and have recommended them numerous times on the Python subreddits, and usually get comments that they’re so expensive (when compared to Udemy’s “sale prices” of $13).</description>
