Things have been relatively quiet since my last update about Snowy a couple of weeks ago. What’s been going on behind the scenes:
 Sandy triaged and assigned milestones to lots of features requests in Snowy bugzilla. Jeff hacked on Snowy to allow users to add a second OpenID provider to an existing account. Unfortunately it will have to be refactored as it works great for new users signing up but not for existing users as the form enforces that the users are unique.</description>

      <description>The Tomboy Online / Snowy team needs your help! We have an alpha instance of Tomboy Online up and running thanks to the wonderful GNOME Sysadmin team and we even have some new contributors helping with Snowy’s code (hi Jeff!).
But we need help! We need help with the web design for Tomboy Online and we’ll need help implementing it.
First, the design. Here’s what we have today:

      <title>GNOME Odds &amp; Ends</title>

      <description>A few different things going on:
 Tomboy documentation is almost done in Mallard. I’ve really enjoyed using the Mallard syntax – so much less complex than Docbook. Every time I have to look up an element reference, I shake my head and think, “Duh! That makes so much more sense I should have figured that out!“. Nice work Shaun. I triaged some docs bugs in GNOME Bugzilla. Want to get involved with the GNOME Documentation team but don’t know where to start?</description>

      <title>Meet Snowy, Tomboy&#39;s best friend</title>

      <description>Tomboy was one of the first GNOME products I contributed code (documentation) to. It also is one of my all time favorite apps and one I can’t do without on a day to day basis. Whether it’s jotting down ideas I don’t want to forget, to-do lists, or organizing the release plan for the next GNOME Journal, I always have a bunch of notes open.
A few weeks ago, I finally got around to trying to sync my notes via sshfs on my desktop and laptop.</description>

      <description>Lots of stuff going on in the world of GNOME for me!
Attended a few meetings last week with GNOME related projects.
This past Sunday, April 19th, the Documentation team met for the first time in a while. Shaun gave an update on the status of Mallard, the new markup language for GNOME Docs; a possible change to how we license docs; an introduction to Pulse and some brainstorming on new ways to bring guides to users.</description>

      <title>Tasky on Foresight 2</title>
      <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2008/02/tasky-on-foresight-2/</link>

      <description>Tasky is a new task management application for the GNOME desktop. Written by Boyd Timothy and Calvin Gaisford, Tasky features syncing with Remember the Milk, but doesn’t feature the ability to use RTM tags yet. Tasky is a great way to help implement and use Getting Things Done.
I went on the adventure last night of packaging Tasky for Foresight 2 in my personal repository on rBuilder, the first package I’ve added to my own repo.</description>
