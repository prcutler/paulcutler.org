I received a HP dv1000 as a gift from the Company last week, and quickly threw [Ubuntu 5.04][1] on it.

It&#8217;s a gorgeous laptop &#8211; Centrino based, with an Intel 54g built in, built in 5 in 1 card reader, firewire, USB everywhere, and widescreen 1280&#215;768 monitor. It&#8217;s pretty sexy for a notebook too, with a silver finish on the outside, and a shiny, glossy black finish on the inside.

Ubuntu worked great on it, other than the Centrino wireless, but Intel is starting to make a push in supporting Linux with their wireless cards. [Following the How-To on the Ubuntu Forums][2] helped, but it didn&#8217;t work until I changed my kernel from 2.6.10-5-386 to 2.6.10-5-686, and bam, everything worked.

Ubuntu works great on it, the card reader is supported, installation defaulted to the correct widescreen, DVD-RW, Synaptic touchpad worked, and battery life is excellent.

Need to throw some other applications on it before the weekend, including Tomboy, Bluefish, MP3, DVD playing, and Muine, and I&#8217;ll work on the blog layout while visiting the in-laws this weekend.
