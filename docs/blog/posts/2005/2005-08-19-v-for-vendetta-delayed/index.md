Damn, this sucks: [V for Vendetta has been delayed from November until March][1].

I recently bought the graphic novel again, which I hadn&#8217;t read in years, and it was still as powerful as ever. I highly recommend it. The movie adapation from what I&#8217;ve seen and heard isn&#8217;t 100% true to the book, but I still have high hopes.
