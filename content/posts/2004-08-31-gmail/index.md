[Google][1] has to be getting close to launching [Gmail][2] based on the number of invites I&#8217;ve been receiving.

6 last week &#8211; gone. Less than a week later, 6 more. Use one yesterday, today I have 6 again.

Sent 3 of those out already to [TCLUG members][3], we&#8217;ll see how long until Google restocks me.
