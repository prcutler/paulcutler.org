                <p>I’ve been in Los Angeles for most of the two weeks. I hate traveling, as I feel out of the loop on stuff, so trying to get caught up. A few others have posted some similar links, but here’s what’s going on in the world of Foresight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shuttle’s KPC <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856101065">launched on Newegg</a> a day or two ago. $209.99 with Foresight pre-installed.</li>
<li><a href="http://foresightlinux.org/gnome.html">Foresight 2.0’s GNOME edition was released 8 days ago</a> featuring GNOME 2.22 and a complete re-design of Foresight’s base infrastructure. Amazingly fast installer, latest GNOME, and some new default settings. A few things left to tweak, but I’m so amazed by the progress Foresight has made in the last year since I started using it. <a href="http://foresightlinux.org/gnome.html">Download it</a> and / or <a href="http://foresightlinux.org/releases/2-0.html">read the release notes</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://forum.foresightlinux.org/index.php">Foresight Forums are live</a>! I’m very impressed by the number of people who have created accounts already, and the number of discussions going on. Big shout out to Stef for launching the appliance.</li>
<li>I booked my flight for the <a href="https://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/marketing/Foresight+User+and+Developer+Conference">Foresight User and Developer Conference</a>. I’m very excited to see two of our UK devs coming over the pond to join us. Be there or be square!</li>
<li>Here’s a great interview with our fearless leader <a href="http://www.fsckin.com/2008/03/19/interview-with-ken-vandine-of-foresight-linux/">Ken VanDine at fsckin.com</a>.</li>
<li>Here’s a <a href="http://mklinuxos.blogspot.com/2008/03/news-foresight-linux-20-released.html">nice review of Foresight 2.0</a>. Love the User Guide shout out.</li>
<li>Here’s a <a href="http://www.distro-review.com/review-foresight-2">mixed review of Foresight</a>. The author liked the installation, User Guide, and had some valid concerns about PackageKit, Conary’s lack of metadata, and codec installation. Stuff I hope to work on this weekend. The author does not recommend Foresight at the end, and recommends Ubuntu to new users. I don’t have a problem with bad reviews – it’s good to maintain perspective and gives us developers goals to work towards to keep making Foresight better.</li>
<li><a href="http://live.gnome.org/Tasque">Tasque</a>, formerly Tasky, is now available in the Foresight repositories instead of my personal repo. It’s still in 2-qa for testing. Rock!</li>
<li>The <a href="http://abock.org/2008/03/13/banshee-10-alpha-1/">first alpha of the new Banshee</a> is also available for testing in 2-qa, available as banshee-1.</li>
<li>Audacity is <a href="http://www.rpath.com/rbuilder/repos/foresight/troveInfo?t=audacity">now available in 2-qa</a> for the first time in Foresight. GTK-1 apps are a pain to build packages for, and Ken is the man for getting this in. Time to start learning how to podcast!</li>
<li>ATI’s proprietary driver, <a href="http://www.rpath.com/rbuilder/repos/foresight/troveInfo?t=ati-fglrx">fglrx</a>, is available for testing in 2-devel for the first time in Foresight 2.0. I’m going to install and test it this weekend on my test box. I still need to write the documentation for installing that in the User Guide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of stuff going on! We still have bugs to fix, packages to add, and updates to documentation that need to be written. If you’ve ever wanted to contribute, now’s a great time. For more information ping me in IRC, pcutler on Freenode in #foresight.</p>
