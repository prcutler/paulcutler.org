I want to dedicate two nights a week to programming / web development. Unfortunately, with the 3 machines I have here at my desk, my Windows box is the only one really set up for any type of long term typing.

The problem is I&#8217;m used to Bluefish on linux, and recently I also tried Screem, which was equally impressive. Jedit on Windows is just plain ugly, and feature lacking, and there really aren&#8217;t any other good open source alternatives I&#8217;ve found. I need to get off my butt, get my server sorted out so I know how many hard drives I really have (and work), and pop one in my gaming box so I can dual boot.

So much work to do, so little time.

In other news, Matt came over this weekend, and we&#8217;re 90% done with the electrical wiring. Get the ceiling boxed out, fnish the wiring, get the insulation in and we&#8217;re ready for the drywall! I need to keep the momentum going with the basement, so I don&#8217;t stall anymore.
