[Neil Gaiman][1] continues to be one of my favorite authors ([and tweeters][2]). I [bought a print][3] of his poem &#8220;_The Day the Saucers Came&#8221;_ in 2007 when it first came out and finally have gotten around to having it framed. (And I have #69 of 750 made, a nice low number!)

&#8220;_The Day the Saucers Came_&#8221; was originally published in Neil Gaiman&#8217;s short story collection, &#8220;_[Fragile Things][4]_&#8221; and was one of my favorite stories included. The fact that it became the first print available illustrated by Jouni Koponen was even better.
