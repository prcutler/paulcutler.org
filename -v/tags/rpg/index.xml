      <description>Wil Wheaton is blogging about something I’ve always wanted to do, which is to run a D&amp;amp;D campaign for his son. (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, and Part 5).
I even went so far as a couple of years ago in buying the 3rd edition Players Handbook, DM Guide and Monster Manual, but I never did run a campaign.
Why not?
I suck as a DM.
I’m just not creative or flexible enough that when a player throws me for a curve to react.</description>
