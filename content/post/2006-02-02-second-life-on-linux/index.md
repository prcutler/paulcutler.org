It&#8217;s here! I received the email yesterday to participate in the alpha test of Second Life&#8217;s Linux client. It&#8217;s Alpha &#8211; it has a few graphic glitches, but it&#8217;s working. It seems to run fast so far.

The client is very Mac OS-ish and very intuitive. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t have time to play as I needed to watch Jack with my better half out shopping, but I&#8217;m really looking forward to spending some time this weekend with Second Life.

Obligatory screenshot right after I logged in:
