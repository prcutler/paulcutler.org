Back home after traveling 2 out of the last 3 weeks. And the last 3 weekends in a row.

Florida was nice. 80 every day. I could get used to that.

Messed around with Netjuke a bit last night to see if I could get downloading to finally worked. Installed gzip on Apache. The good news, you can now d/l one file at a time. The bad news, you can&#8217;t d/l more than one file at a time.

Looking at the gzip log files, it appeared to be an Internet Explorer thing (ha, there&#8217;s a surprise). IE 5.5 doesn&#8217;t read gzip encoded web pages right, nice bug. The pages are loading a lot faster though in IE and Mozilla, so a part of it is working right.

But in Mozilla, I couldn&#8217;t d/l multiple files either, so I think I need to play with my Apache configuration. (Ugh).

So I&#8217;ll add that to my to-do list, which keeps growing. And growing. And growing.
