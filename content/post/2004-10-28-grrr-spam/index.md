So not only is email spam a problem, but [Zoe&#8217;s blog][1] has been hit by weblog spammers. Time to download some plugins.

Each post has 4-6 comments with regular text quotations, but then the poster&#8217;s name is a link to online casinos. You&#8217;re telling me online casinos need money so badly this is what they resort too?

I&#8217;m a little angry. Got some hacking to do tonight!
