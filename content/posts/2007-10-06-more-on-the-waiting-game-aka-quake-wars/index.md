I, [like Phoronix][1], thought the Linux client was days away, but it&#8217;s weeks according to a [post I saw on Linux-Gaming.net][2] this morning:

> I&#8217;ve also been making steady progress with the Linux Client, and it&#8217;s coming along really well. We&#8217;ve been running a closed-beta test for &#8216;friends and family&#8217; for a little while, and for the past couple of weeks have had a fully functional version of the demo running. The closed-beta testers are now able to play alongside Windows players on the same version, with full Punkbuster support. The major systems including the renderer and audio are working great, and performance has been good on both the NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards.

> Alongside my other responsibilities at id, my focus now is on optimization for the Linux Client. If everything goes to plan, we should have the Linux Client ready for release in just a few weeks.

Darn. Well, I have tons of stuff to do with Foresight right now anyway, but it would have been fun to have some time to play before my new job starts in a couple weeks!
