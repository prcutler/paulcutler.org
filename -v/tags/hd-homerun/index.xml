      <description>A few weeks ago I blogged about buying the hardware to set up a MythTV PC to record off air high def TV and integrate it with Boxee.
The hardware arrived and Iâ€™ve been working on on the setup off and on over the last few weeks. Some random thoughts:
  The HD Homerun tuner is pretty cool. Fedora has the HD Homerun configuration tool in their repos. Installing that through PackageKit and yum made it easy to test out that it was working and had a good signal.</description>
