As a GNOME guy, I don&#8217;t use KDE.

As it was pointed out to me today (thanks Og!), without any intended ill intent, I left off any news of KDE in the Foresight Newsletter I&#8217;m working on.

One of the cool things coming with Foresight 2.0, is a KDE edition and a XFCE edition. The beauty of open source is choice &#8211; whether it&#8217;s a desktop environment, music player or your choice of web server.

The KDE edition is a little further along than the XFCE edition at this point, and one-ups the GNOME edition in the fact that it&#8217;s only 695 MB! One of these days we will get the GNOME edition to fit on a single CD. ðŸ™‚

Jtate and Int are leading the way in developing the KDE edition, which is also attracting new Foresight users such as Nixternal, whom you may know from such shows as Planet Ubuntu or Chicago LUG, and old Foresight users such as Og, who&#8217;s helping translate KDE to pt-br.

  * Download the KDE [x86 version here][1] or the [x86_64 version here][2]
  * Add KDE to an existing GNOME alpha edition: `sudo conary update group-kde` (Not 100% sure this works)
  * [File bugs here][3]

Now is a great time to get involved with Foresight &#8211; whether it&#8217;s helping polish the GNOME edition, help building the KDE or XFCE editions, or helping on any number of tasks in progress, such as documentation writing; bug triaging; building our next generation website or forums, or helping with marketing and attracting new users.

More information coming in this month&#8217;s newsletter!
