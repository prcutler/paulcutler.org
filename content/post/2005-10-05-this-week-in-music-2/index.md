A few new releases came out this week I just had to pickup:

  * [Liz Phair][1]: Somebody&#8217;s Miracle
  * [Fiona Apple][2]: Extraordinary Machine
  * [Public Enemy][3]: New Whirl Order

I enjoyed Fiona&#8217;s first release, what, 10 years ago? Her second was good, but not as good. I&#8217;m looking forward to this after all the press about Fiona over the last two years. (Free Fiona!)

I&#8217;m a huge Liz Phair &#8211; have been since Exile in Guyville and have bought everything she&#8217;s done. 2003&#8217;s self-titled album was a bit of a shock as she transitioned to pop, and Somebody&#8217;s Miracle is in the same vein. Listened to the album almost twice now, and while her last album had 3 or 4 songs that popped at me right away, so far the new one only has one, which is her current release, Everything to Me, which is catchy as hell.

Public Enemy&#8217;s newest album in quite some time, New Whirl Order, was another must have. Other than the Beastie Boys, they&#8217;re the only rap group I&#8217;ve ever really, really gotten in to. I picked up their greatest hits disc a month or so back, and that was phenomenal. I&#8217;m looking forward to New Whirl Order.
