GNOME 2.20 is out and that means a formal release of [Foresight Linux, 1.4][1], is out to go with it!

Why do I say &#8220;formal release of Foresight Linux&#8221;? Because of Conary, Foresight does rolling releases &#8211; whenever a package has a major update, you&#8217;ll get it right away, so you always have the latest bug fixes of your favorite software.

Here are the [GNOME 2.20 Release Notes][2], Foresight 1.4 [release announcement][3] and [release notes][4], and because it is [International Talk Like a Pirate Day][5], [the release notes done by our resident pirates][6].

And of course, the best place to get the latest GNOME is Foresight Linux &#8211; [download today][7].

Congrats to the team for another great release, and here&#8217;s to 2.0 in the near future!
