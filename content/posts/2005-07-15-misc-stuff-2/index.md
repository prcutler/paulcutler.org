I&#8217;m back from California, and getting caught up on misc. stuff.

I&#8217;ve updated the theme to K2 Alpha 3, added a new Flickr badge, and still don&#8217;t care that it doesn&#8217;t work in Internet Explorer. Go get [Firefox][1] already.

I [mentioned the Burn It Club][2] a while back. The summer [Burn It session][3] is now on if any of my three readers want to do it with me. I have to say I&#8217;m struggling with the theme, but I really want to participate.

I have a ton of stuff do this weekend, more as my muse wills later.
