Gregory Mcdonald, most famous for being the author of the Fletch series, [has died at age 71 from cancer][1].

I&#8217;m not a big mystery reader, but due to [Kevin Smith][2]&#8216;s praise for McDonald&#8217;s dialogue in his novels, I picked up one or two of his books, and then quickly bought them all a number of years ago.

You thought the Fletch movies (well, at least the first one) were funny? Each and every one of these books will have you chuckling and laughing out loud at some point, and the mysteries weren&#8217;t half bad either.

They&#8217;re light, quick reads, and the next time you&#8217;re looking for a book to read, I highly recommend any of his books, including both the Fletch and Flynn series.
