Here&#8217;s why I like the [EFF][1].

The EFF has [filed a brief in support of DirecTV][2] against a website operator who is suing DirecTV for accessing his website. Basically, if you want to make your website private, set up a password &#8211; you don&#8217;t have a right to say &#8220;don&#8217;t enter here if you work for so and so&#8221; which this yahoo is trying to do.

What do I like about it? EFF has gone after DirecTV in the past. From the article:

> EFF has opposed DirecTV in the past for its legal campaign against &#8220;smart cards,&#8221; and co-sponsors a website, www.directvdefense.org, designed to help those who have been sued by DirecTV. However, as Bankston said, &#8220;When it comes to protecting the rights of Internet users, EFF doesn&#8217;t hold a grudge. We may oppose DirecTV in other cases, but here, it&#8217;s plainly on the correct side.&#8221;

But the EFF is on the side of what&#8217;s right &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t always matter who.
