I am a married father of three, living just outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota. I work as a product management executive in the cybersecurity industry.  When I'm not attending my kid's sports activities or introducing them to classic 80's movies, you can find me listening to records from my [vinyl collection](https://discogs.com/user/prcutler), watching a movie, or learning to code in Python.

I have been involved with a few open source projects in the past, mostly with [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org). I also used to be an avid gamer, known as Silwenae.  I am a fervent believer in civil liberties and a long time vocal supporter of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff..org).  I have been blogging here for almost twenty years, mostly about nothing, but most recently about learning [Python](https://paulcutler.org/tags/python) and [building an arcade cabinet](https://paulcutler.org/tags/arcade).
