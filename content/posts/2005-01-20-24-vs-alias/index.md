[I recently blogged about Alias&#8217; current reboot][1], and as I try and get caught up on my TiVo, I finally watched the two hour premier of 24.

Talk about how to reboot a show in two totally different ways. I&#8217;ve already complained about Alias and my inability to suspend my imagination about the reboot. 24 handled it the opposite &#8211; in less than 5 minutes they explained the changes in Jack&#8217;s life, made it believable, and then the action just grabbed you and didn&#8217;t let go for two hours. Sure, Jack becoming a temporary field agent stretches the imagination a bit, but no where near how Sydney&#8217;s working for Sloan again does.

I was very impressed with 24&#8217;s season premiere, and couldn&#8217;t stop watching. Where with Alias, I watched it, but I was just waiting for the next thing to happen.

The 3rd season of 24 might have been the weakest in some regards, but it was also better with how they kept the plot moving, 3 major plot shifts instead of 2 at the twelve hour mark, (which helps people watching for continuity&#8217;s sake). The 4th kicked off with a bang, and hasn&#8217;t let go yet.

I&#8217;ll continue to watch both shows, but for very different reasons.
