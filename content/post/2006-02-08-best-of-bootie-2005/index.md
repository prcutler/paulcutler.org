Go [here and download][1] the Best of Bootie 2005, a collection of mash-ups featuring the favorite mashups of 2005 bootiesf.com.

They picked some good ones &#8211; I really dig the album. But then again, I dig mashups. What&#8217;s a mashup? Think remix, especially when you combine one artists vocals with a completely different artists music. Look at the track listing on the link above &#8211; the last song on the album is actually really good, which is NWA vocal&#8217;s laid over Nirvana&#8217;s Smells like Teen Spirit.

Give it a try &#8211; you won&#8217;t believe until you listen.
