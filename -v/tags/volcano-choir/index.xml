With 2013 now in the books, I’d like to share some of my favorite albums of 2013. After Polica dropped their debut album digitally on December 20th, 2011, I’ve learned to wait until the year is over to share my favorite albums – don’t want to miss one!
These might not be the critic’s choices, but these are albums I like, and almost all of them I’ve bought on vinyl this year.</description>

      <description>“Certified” to be frustration free. Especially when they tape over the easy open pull tab when you’re trying to get to your new shiny vinyl record.
(It’s Volcano Choir’s first album, Unmap, if you were curious.)</description>

      <description>Summer is the slow time for new music releases and August saw a number of great new releases, with even more coming later this fall.
Here’s some of the new releases I picked up on vinyl in August:
 Superchunk – I Hate Music: The alt rockers have been around since 1989(!) and I Hate Music is their tenth album. The album is short and sweet, clocking in at just over 37 minutes.</description>
