GNOME 2.18 is 2 days from release &#8211; have you taken it for a test drive yet? Thanks to Ken Vandine and Foresight Linux, there is now more than just one way to take GNOME 2.18 for a spin. VMWare images, QEMU / Parallels, name your virtualization way and there&#8217;s probably an image, in addition to a LiveCD.

Visit the [downloads page][1] and pick your way to test out GNOME. Links will be updated once 2.18 goes final. Take some LiveCDs to your next LUG meeting or installfest, and show off GNOME 2.18 powered by Foresight.

_Simply Beautiful._
