I&#8217;m pleased to announce the 1.0 release of the Getting Started with
  
Foresight Linux User Guide:

[http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/docs/Getting+Started+with+Foresight+Linux
  
][1] 
  
The User Guide provides a high level overview of Foresight Linux, including:

  * Download and Installing Foresight Linux
  * Post-Installation Configuration
  * Using Applications
  * Updating Foresight / Adding & Removing Programs
  * Getting Help
  * Getting Involved with Foresight Linux

The User Guide is intended for users new to Linux or new to Foresight,
  
though advanced users may learn something as well.

The User Guide currently lives on the Foresight Wiki, so if you have
  
any updates or see any errors, feel free to update it, I would love to
  
have some more eyes looking at it. I hope to export it to HTML and /
  
or Docbook in the next month or so.
