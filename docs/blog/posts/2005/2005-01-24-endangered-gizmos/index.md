The [EFF][1] has launched a new campaign: [Endangered Gizmos][2]. As Big Media threatens innovation, reverse engineering, and freedom of invention, the EFF has put up a list of Extinct technology (/wave Replay, DVD-X-Copy), Endangered (HDTV Tuners, Open WiFi hotspots, MP3 players), and products that have been Saved in the court system (from the Betamax which begat VHS which begat DVD to printer cartridges).

Each product carries a link to more information, whether it&#8217;s the HDTV Broadcast Flag, information on the court cases that have saved innovation, or the history of the product itself.

This is why the EFF matters. It&#8217;s not just the court cases they wage every day, it&#8217;s the education they provide, like this, that everyone can understand, not just technophiles.

Go Go EFF!
