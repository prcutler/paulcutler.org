Ah, the good old says when the interweb was young, and to chat in a group required IRC.

Fazin pointed out a quote tonight at the site [Bash.org][1] which is just filled with quotes from IRC taking me back to another time. I highly recommend spending an hour and going through their top 100. I was laughing so hard my stomach hurt.

A few favorites I saw:
