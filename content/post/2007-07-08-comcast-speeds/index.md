I haven&#8217;t been a huge fan of Comcast since we were switched over from Time Warner last year. They jacked prices up 30%, and have horrible customer service, but the quality of service of the broadband connection has maintained.

I recently switched to a commercial account recently through an accomodation program at work, so I&#8217;m getting better upload and download speeds, for about 15% cheaper than my previous bill.

The speed tests were interesting, why couldn&#8217;t I have had this kind of speed 7 or 8 years ago when I was running a Counter-Strike server?!
