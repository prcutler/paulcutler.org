The New York Times [has an article up about Homaro Cantu][1] (no registered required link!) who prints edible pictures of sushi on a Canon i560 inkjet printer and serves them to customers.

Mr. Cantu has a vision to make technology enhance the dining experience, including making food levitate, edible printouts (in 3d no less), and edible utensils.

Interesting stuff.
