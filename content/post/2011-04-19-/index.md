Today is the ninth anniversary of the day Alice in Chains lead singer, Layne Stayley, was found dead in his Seattle apartment. Layne had been dead for two weeks, dying of a heroin and cocaine overdose on April 5th, 2002.

I saw Alice in Chains twice growing up. The first time was in a small club, the Eagles Ballroom, opening, believe it or not, for Extreme in the fall of 1991. The show was terrible. We got there early as we usually did, and the club was fairly empty as Alice in Chains took the stage. Grunge hadn&#8217;t taken over yet and the Seattle explosion was still six months away from taking over the airwaves. Standing five feet away from the band, we could see that Layne was high as a kite &#8211; I vividly remember seeing how dilated his eyes were and as he growled out the lyrics to their first album, the crowd eventually booed them off the stage while we waited for the hair metal headliner Extreme to take the stage.

A couple years later I saw Alice in Chains open for Van Halen at the Marcus Amphitheater. The show wasn&#8217;t much better, though the crowd at least knew who Alice in Chains was.
