Let&#8217;s just say that I received such a form letter in response to my email, that I won&#8217;t even post it. Basically they implied it was a problem with my webhost since I don&#8217;t host with GoDaddy. It led me to firing back this, short and sweet:

> Your stock answer below does not answer either of my questions.

> Let me be clear as to what my questions are:

> 1. Why did GoDaddy park my domain for a period of 6-12 hours on 1/9/2006?
  
> 2. Why did GoDaddy&#8217;s account management system on godaddy.com show me my

> Those two errors above cost me another 2 year domain renewal fee as I

Now they need to verify it&#8217;s me speaking to them, and the cycle continues.
