So I&#8217;m sitting here at the in-laws, have a while till I leave.

So I fixed all the imported blog entries from my old blog. All of the categories are now correct.

Still not sure why the old blog entries that had hyperlinks in them only show up when you click the whole entry instead of the front page, but I&#8217;m not going to worry about it. If people are going back a year and a half to read my blog entries, they&#8217;ll figure it out.
