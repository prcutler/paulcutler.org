The latest [GNOME Journal][1] is out!

We have six articles in this issue:

  * Will Kahn-Greene writes his first article for GNOME Journal about the GNOME Miro Community. Want to watch videos about GNOME? Will has all the information you need.
  * GNOME Bugzilla was upgraded late last year. Sumana Harihareswara writes up the case study on the partnership between the GNOME Foundation, Canonical and Everything Solved, a consultancy focused on Bugzilla.
  * Stormy Peters interviews Juan José Sánchez Penas, who works at Igalia and sits on the GNOME Advisory Board.
  * Jono Bacon writes about a topic I&#8217;m personally passionate about &#8211; tools for opportunistic developers who want to write small, focused and fun applications for GNOME.
  * And another topic I&#8217;m passionate about &#8211; Shaun McCance introduces Mallard, the new XML schema we&#8217;re using to write help and documentation in GNOME.
  * And last, but not certainly not least &#8211; Jim Hodapp writes a Letter from the Editor &#8211; thank you Jim for all your hard work on GNOME Journal as Editor in Chief and your kind words.
