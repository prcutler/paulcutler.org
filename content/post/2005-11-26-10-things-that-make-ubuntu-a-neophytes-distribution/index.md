I don&#8217;t think of myself as a neophyte when it comes to Linux or Ubuntu, but the All About Linux Blog covers [10 things that make Ubuntu great for a new Linux user][1].

I won&#8217;t cover them here, as he does a great job of explaining them. And I whole-heartedly agree &#8211; Ubuntu is the only distribution I would recommend for someone new to Linux. Or even to a user who&#8217;s used Linux for a while. By far the best distribution I&#8217;ve ever used, and it&#8217;s still my day to day OS at home on my two primary machines.
