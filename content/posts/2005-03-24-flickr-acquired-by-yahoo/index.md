My favorite photo-sharing site, [Flickr][1] was [acquired][2] by Yahoo this week.

The link to the [Flickr Blog][3] has some interesting Q&As about what it means.

While I&#8217;m nervous about it, I&#8217;m not worried. I hope what they&#8217;re saying is true that Flickr will influence Yahoo more than Yahoo influencing Flickr.

Flickr is great for a few reasons:

It&#8217;s [completely built on Open Source software][4].

Flickr&#8217;s use of [Creative Commons][5]

Flickr&#8217;s use of social networking to [tag photos][6]. (Search for &#8220;Packers&#8221; some time &#8211; you see some great shot of Lambeau during a game).

Flickr&#8217;s [tools for integrating photos into blogs][7].

I&#8217;m very happy for [Ludicorp][8]. Good for them for building a site that works, people like, and being able to make some money for it.

CNet&#8217;s News.com did a [great story on Flickr, tagging, and it&#8217;s acquisition][9].
