The 2nd best Christmas Present I received was a book from a co-worker: The Daily Adventures of Mixerman, by [Mixerman][1].

The book tells the story of Mixerman, a sound engineer in Los Angeles hired to mix a new up and coming band&#8217;s CD. This dysfunctional band, signed to the label after a bidding war, has been locked away by the music label for 2 years to write a &#8220;radio hit&#8221;. Everyone in the book is anonymous, including the author, to protect the band&#8217;s identity. From Willy Show, the big time producer, nick named because his contract to produce the album isn&#8217;t done and he doesn&#8217;t show up for a week, to the aptly named Dumb Ass, the drummer who can&#8217;t do anything right.

The book is a hilarious look at everything that can go wrong in a recording session, and a behind the scenes look at the music industry. Originally posted almost as a blog in 2002 (before blogs were cool), the book contains all of the blog entries, and the missing final entry. It was easy reading, and will keep you laughing the whole way through.
