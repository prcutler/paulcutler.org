            <div class="post-content">
                <p>A week and half ago, <a href="http://www.silwenae.net/blog/index.php?p=33">I purchased Fable and NHL2k5 for my X-box</a>. I’ve probably played 10-12 games of hockey, and having a blast doing it – even if on Pro I’m still winning too many, even if by only 1 goal.</p>
<p>I haven’t played Fable as near as much as I’ve wanted due to two things:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Was traveling</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>It’s a M rated game – as I found out after I started playing it. And Alex likes watching me play way too much for him to see me playing a role playing game as I hack away at the bad guys.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So I had received a gift card last week, and after trying out <a href="http://www.farcry-thegame.com/">Farcry</a> at Kent’s a week or two ago, decided to pick it up, as I enjoy a good FPS. After the fun I had playing <a href="http://www.callofduty.com/">Call of Duty</a> single-player a year after everyone else, I decided this could be a good fit. So I bought it today. Come back to the office, and get more presents: <a href="http://www.totalwar.com/community/rome.htm">Rome: Total War</a>, a new real time strategy getting good reviews, and <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/games/swbattlefront/">Star Wars: Battlefront</a> (Warning: flash site) for the PC.</p>
<p>Considering I’ll be wiring the basement this weekend, in Orlando the following weekend, in Chicago after that, then at Lambeau the weekend after for the Cowboys game, when will I find the time? I still have Fable to play, my NFL2k5 football and hockey seasons, and two beta’s, including WoW to test. I’ve barely caught up on my TiVO from the last week or two, and here we go again… Good thing I haven’t bought X-Men from Raven yet! And I haven’t even thought about practicing for the BFG lan competition.</p>
<p>When it rains, it pours.</p>
