[ESPN&#8217;s Len Pasquarelli is reporting][1] that Mike McKenzie will report to the Green Bay Packers Wed. morning, ending his holdout.

He is still seeking a trade, but is hoping a shift in strategy (by reporting to work) will help his case.

Even with a very good performance Monday night by the Pack, it will be nice to have him back.
