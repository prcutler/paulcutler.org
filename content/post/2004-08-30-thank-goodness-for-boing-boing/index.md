Thank goodness for [boingboing.net][1]. This site has provided hours of amusement, but [their][2] [chronicling][3] of the [Bikes Against Bush][4] and the [Joshua Kinberg story][5] (MSNBC link) is eye opening.

In other news, [Republicans hate New York][6]. Oh wait, that&#8217;s where they&#8217;re having their convention. Hypocrites.
