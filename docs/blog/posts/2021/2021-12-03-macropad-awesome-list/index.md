Inspired by the CircuitPython Awesome List, I've created an [Awesome List for the Adafruit Macropad](https://github.com/prcutler/awesome-macropad).

I finally found some time to set mine up after I received mine this past summer in the Adafruit AdaBox subscription.  I've 3D printed a couple of cases for it already and also programmed mine to work with the Onshape CAD software.

It's pretty cool and I was curious to see what others had programmed for macros for their applications and I figured why not create a list for everyone!

If you have any suggestions for what to add, please let me know or feel free to fork and send a pull request.  Contributing guidelines are in the list and if you have any questions, you can find me on Twitter or on the Adafruit Discord (link in the list).
