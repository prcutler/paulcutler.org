That Howard Dean could get the nomination?

[This article at MSNBC][1] sums up centrist Democrats&#8217; fears.

Is it really only his anti-war stance? Many, many people believe that the war in Iraq was unjustified &#8211; yes we have removed a menace, but it&#8217;s how we went about doing it as well.

As many people learn more about Dean, they&#8217;ll find out he&#8217;s not that far left. Yes, on the war he absolutely is. His health care proposal is excellent &#8211; but liberal. His take on gun control is moderate &#8211; and some would even say to the right of most centrist Democrats.

But for Democrats to say their worst fear is his nomination and compare that to McGovern, Mondale and Dukakis, that&#8217;s a reach.

Let&#8217;s face facts &#8211; when was the last time a sitting Senator won a presidential election? What do Kerry, Lieberman, or even Edwards offer that&#8217;s unique or not a line handed to them from the DLC? And for Lieberman to go on the Today show and sound off yesterday, if that&#8217;s not spin, I don&#8217;t know what is. Bob Graham has an interesting opportunity, but is he late to the party?

Dean has been consistent. Much more so than any other Democratic hopeful. Yes, he was Governor of a small state &#8211; but at least he has hands on experience governing, which I don&#8217;t believe the current crop of Senators necessarily do. 

I&#8217;ll save my Lieberman rant for a later date.
