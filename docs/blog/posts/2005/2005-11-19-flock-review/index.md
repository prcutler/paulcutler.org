Newsforge has a pretty good [review of Flock][1] up.

I&#8217;ve downloaded the Linux client, and while stable, I haven&#8217;t really used enough of it to comment yet. It brings together a number of tools I use while browsing, including Flickr and blogging. Delicious bookmarks are definitely something I want to get into a lot more, especially since I share so many computers.

If you&#8217;re into Web 2.0 / social networking / insert buzzword here, and want to see read a review of a browser for Web 2.0, hit the link above.
