Happy New Year! Kelly&#8217;s due date has come and gone, so we will be welcoming in the New Year any day now with a baby.

Resolutions this year? A few off the top of my head:

  * Finish the basement
  * Clean my closet
  * Build a HTPC
  * Go to Guyfest
  * Get silwenae.net back up and running, including with Jinzora
  * Make a Podcast
There&#8217;s a ton more, especially basement related, but I&#8217;ll just stop there. </ul>
