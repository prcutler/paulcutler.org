The [American Marketing Association defines marketing][1] as:

> Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.

I don&#8217;t think there is a question that GNOME has value for customers, clients, partners and society at large.

It&#8217;s our job to shout about that value from the rooftops, far and wide.

Right now though, we need to focus on the first part of that sentence:

> Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes&#8230; 

Now is a great time to join the [GNOME Marketing][2] team. We&#8217;re getting organized, including [organizing sub-teams][3], revamping our [team member page][4] (add your name!), updating the [tasks we want to accomplish][5] (don&#8217;t click that yet, we are still [migrating our content][6]!), and beginning to define the messages we want to communicate, and how we will communicate them.

I strongly believe that GNOME 3.0 offers us a unique opportunity for marketing GNOME, first to our current users about the changes coming, and to even more audiences about the benefits of GNOME, including developers, GNOME Mobile, and non-GNOME users.

We need volunteers who are passionate about communicating the benefits of GNOME. We need writers, editors, art designers, researchers, speakers, event organizers, project managers and more.

We need you. Join the [mailing list][7] or [sign up on our wiki][4]. Let&#8217;s tell the world about GNOME.
