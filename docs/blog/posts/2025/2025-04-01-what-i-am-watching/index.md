Each year, the director Steven Soderbergh releases a list of all the movies and TV shows he's watching. It's a fascinating look at what he's interested in and can give a clue to future projects. I've also wanted to do something similar, and this
year I'm finally keeping track of everything I'm watching.  Mr. Soderbergh's list is a daily breakdown - I'm not going into that much detail, but with the exception of sports, I kept track of all the movies and TV shows I watched.

This past February was my birthday, and I treated myself to a subscription to The Criterion Channel. Criterion started as a home video company in 1984 that focuses on licensing, restoring and distributing "important classic and contemporary films". In 2019, Criterion launched a streaming service that offers a curated selection of Criterion's catalog.  For only $99 a year, you get access to classic movies from the last one hundred years of cinema, including some modern classics, such as Minority Report or Down With Love. I'm really enjoying streaming the classics and broadening my knowledge of cinema history.

Even with the two podcasts and my electronics hobby, I watch a lot of TV and movies. TV Shows listed are the month I finished watching the season.  Movies are in bold. This list includes physical releases, streaming, and re-watches.
