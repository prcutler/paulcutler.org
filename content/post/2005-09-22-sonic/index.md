A follow-up from my visit to Houston last week: I finally had the chance to eat at a [Sonic][1], &#8220;America&#8217;s Drive-In&#8221;.

The funny thing is, none of us had any idea it was _only_ a drive-in. I see the commericals all the time on ESPN, and have wanted to stop there to see what it was all about. I see the breakfast food commericals about ten times more often than I do for their burgers.

They were all over Houston, I saw more Sonic&#8217;s than McDonald&#8217;s (which is fine with me). Drive through or drive-in are your only choices, maybe outdoor seating if you were lucky. Had a Jalapeno Double Burger with Tater Tots and a Lime-ade, all three of which were quite good for fast food.

Definitely better than your normal chains such as Hardees, McD&#8217;s or BK. Step up from Culvers ups here in the north, but not quite as good as an In &#8216;N Out out west.

And our thoughts are with you for those of you in Houston right now.
