Ahh, NFL kickoff Sunday. Sitting here in the living room with the laptop wirelessly, flipping between games, currently on Bengals @ Jets.

Saw Resident Evil 2 last night. It was entertaining, closer to a rental than in the theater, but we had a good time.

White Chocolate Reese&#8217;s Peanut Butter Cups are weird.

In general silwenae.net news, I have my old blog re-installed, but I cannot get it imported into this one for whatever reason. Both the RSS importer and the b2evo2wp importer crap out. I might look into doing it by hand, but blech.

Have some plans for the silwenae.net homepage, but all this CSS & PHP stuff needs to be learned.

I did get my [GPG key uploaded][1] so now you can email me securely!
