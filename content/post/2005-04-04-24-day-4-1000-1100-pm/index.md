This week&#8217;s episode, in Season 4 (Day 4, 10:00 &#8211; 11:00 p.m.) might just be the best episode of 24 ever.

It&#8217;s definitely tied in my mind right now with the season finale from Day 1. I&#8217;m not going to spoil anything, but it&#8217;s an interesting twist to what has come before.

Well done.
