Get ready to listen to the same annual cry from the music industry &#8211; &#8220;_The sky is falling_!&#8221; NPR&#8217;s music blog, The Record, [has the details][2].

For the first time, all music sales, when adding CD, LP, cassette and digital &#8211; declined as a total. Digital tracks grew 1%. One thing the article and Soundscan&#8217;s numbers don&#8217;t cover is how digital sales break down. I would have to guess that the trend of individual track sales is still growing &#8211; which continues to impact albums sold via digital. Total albums sales fell to 326 million, the lowest since 1993, a drop of 13%, which was the same decline as 2009 for total album sales.

NPR&#8217;s article goes on to say that the &#8220;&#8221;return of vinyl&#8221; has hit the brakes.&#8221; Contrast that with a [Rolling Stone article][3], also released yesterday, whose headline says &#8220;Vinyl Sales Increase Despite Industry Slump&#8221;. So whose spin are you going to believe? After reading the NPR article, which points out how terrible the music industry is doing, I&#8217;ll take the Rolling Stone&#8217;s more positive headline. I would think the music industry and their PR flacks would want to jump on any positive news, and the fact that vinyl sales grew 14% year over year, especially when compared to the other declining numbers, is definitely a positive.

Total vinyl sales were the highest they&#8217;ve been since 1991, and for a format most people would consider dead, this growth should be good news to the industry, especially when you consider the average selling price for a vinyl album is significantly higher than a digital album or CD.

Best selling new vinyl albums, in order, for 2010 were:

  * Arcade Fire &#8211; The Suburbs
  * The Black Keys &#8211; Brothers
  * Vampire Weekend &#8211; Contra
  * The National &#8211; High Violet

The best selling overall vinyl album was The Beatles&#8217; Abbey Road.

I believe in quality over quantity and if the record industry would focus on longevity and the quality of the artists rather than hit machines, it would be a different story. Â But that&#8217;s an article for another time.

Here&#8217;s to another year of growth for vinyl in 2011!
