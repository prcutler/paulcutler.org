The [EFF][1] has launched their latest campaign, in [support of bloggers&#8217; rights][2].

Follow the link to see the rights you should have, and how the EFF is fighting to defend your rights every day.

Like many other sites, including [BoingBoing][3], I&#8217;ve added a badge to the right in support of the EFF and their efforts.

Join the EFF &#8211; they&#8217;re even offering a discount off their member rate. It&#8217;s tax deductible, and one of the best non-profits you can donate too. I&#8217;ve been a Pioneer member going on 4 years now.

Defend your rights before it&#8217;s too late. They need your support.
