It&#8217;s release day for Foresight Linux 1.3. Nothing gets your adrenaline flowing like release day as you try and get all your tasks done to help out. Not only did we release the latest and greatest version of Foresight Linux, including GNOME 2.18.2 also released today, Issue #3 of the Newsletter is out. Here are some links to keep you busy:

  * [Foresight Linux 1.3 release notes][1]
  * [Go download Foresight][2]! We have installable CD & DVD images, and lots of Live Media, including VMware images, Parallels / QEMU images, and a LiveCD will be out in the next day or two. Why aren&#8217;t you using Foresight Linux yet? 
  * [Issue #3 of the Newsletter][3]. Including a first look at the next generation version of Foresight Linux, 2.0.
  * The [Release Day HOWTO][3]. All the different tasks that go into release day. (Feel free to add whatever we&#8217;ve missed!)

Use it, love it, and help us make Foresight even better. Stop by #foresight on FreeNode in IRC &#8211; we won&#8217;t bite, I promise.
