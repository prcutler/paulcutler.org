I&#8217;m a big fan of [Last.fm][1] and since I started using [Banshee][2], I&#8217;ve reported all my my music through it. A couple of tools came to my attention today.

Digg linked to the [Mainstream-O-Meter][3] to measure how mainstream your listening habits are. Digg, being the force they are, have made the site go offline temporarily. My music came in at 68% mainstream. 68%! I like to think I&#8217;m a little more eclectic, but maybe I&#8217;m not. Or maybe tech geeks like me who use Last.fm just have similar tastes. ðŸ™‚

Pscott linked the second one, [LastGraph][4], which graphs out your music listening habits over time. You can set the background color / theme, and the date range you want to graph.

Here&#8217;s my 2007 graph:

And here is since I started using Last.fm in Oct. 2005:

[<img src="https://i2.wp.com/farm1.static.flickr.com/219/535527225_0171a3ae24.jpg?resize=500%2C90" width="500" height="90" alt="all-music" data-recalc-dims="1" />][6]

Click through to Flickr to actually read them. A couple of notes:

  * I hacked my Xbox, and added Last.fm reporting. My wife listening to music through it really skews it. (Dixie Chicks or U2 anyone?)
  * I&#8217;m definitely a streaky listener. I get stuck on an album or artist and listen to the crap out of it. (Liz Phair, Chili Peppers, The Shins)
  * You can tell when I installed my home theater in August of last year. From August to December, I wasn&#8217;t spending any time in my office on my PC. It was all about the new, big TV. The little music I listened to was on the Sonos through the network. (I so wish Sonos had Last.fm reporting built-in!)
  * I also listen to a lot of [89.3 The Current][7], both on the radio through the home theater, and streaming online through Banshee. That is not reflected in the graph. That is truly eclectic listening. 

I&#8217;m a big enough fan, that I&#8217;ve actually subscribed for over the last year. I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m thrilled by the recent acquisition by CBS, but I love the statistics Last.fm collects and lets me share, both on their website and through the badge on this blog.
