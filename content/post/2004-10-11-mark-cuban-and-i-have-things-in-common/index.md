Who would have known that Mark Cuban and I have multiple things in common?

No, we both don&#8217;t own basketball teams. (I&#8217;d buy an NFL team first!)

Mark Cuban was in the news last week for [donating $100,000 to the EFF][1] [to fight the INDUCE Act][2]. It appears [to be working][3], as INDUCE is dead for the rest of this year.

Oh, and we&#8217;re on some [mailing list][4] together.
