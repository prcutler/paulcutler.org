Last weekend, my wife had a craving for pretzels. No, she&#8217;s not pregnant, she just loves pretzels. We&#8217;re talking the big, huge soft pretzels covered in salt. She wanted them badly enough that she even asked if the Twins were in town &#8211; and she doesn&#8217;t like baseball. We were also looking up to see if there were any places in the Twin Cities known for their pretzels, but didn&#8217;t find much outside of a couple mall restaurants, and we weren&#8217;t feeling that brave.

As I&#8217;ve dived into cooking over the last year, one of the best things I&#8217;ve found to help teach me to cook has been [Hilah Cooking][2], a website and [Youtube channel][3] hosted by Hilah Johnson for beginner to intermediate cooks. I&#8217;ve [bought her cookbook][4] and watched countless videos teaching me a ton of things I didn&#8217;t know, especially about how to cook, not just what to cook. These include how to season a cast iron skillet, smoke points of oil, and more. Some of these things may be basic to those who have been cooking a while, but I&#8217;ve never had anyone really show me these things, and learning them has been invaluable.

The best part about both Hilah&#8217;s writing and Youtube channel is her humor. I enjoy it and it makes it much more fun to watch than a dry cooking show on some cable channel. Also, being on Youtube, I can just grab my iPad and re-watch the episode while I cook, which is so helpful.

By chance, Hilah posted a soft pretzel recipe two days ago. The timing couldn&#8217;t have been better with my wife&#8217;s cravings, so I ran out to the store yesterday and picked up some yeast and bread flour. The recipe is very simple and the pretzels turned out great. They took a little longer to cook then the recipe calls for and they&#8217;re not as dark brown as shown the video. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s due to the beer I used, but they tasted fantastic, which is what matters! The wife agreed and I see us making more of these in the future.

Here&#8217;s the episode from Hilah&#8217;s Youtube channel as she visits Easy Tiger in Austin, known for their pretzels and beer garden, as well as the recipe.
