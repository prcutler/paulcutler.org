[Slyck.com Interviews Jon Lech Johansen][1], famous (or infamous if you work for Big Media) of DeCSS fame, and *Musique fame. Interesting follow-up to last week&#8217;s post about [Digital Music on Linux][2].

Miguel de Icaza, of Gnome & Mono fame, recently [reached out to Jon to create a pyMusique port to GTK# resulting in SharpeMusique][3].

It&#8217;s on my t0do list to download and try out. I&#8217;d give Apple&#8217;s iTMS a shot if it works. I&#8217;m hoping it shows up soon in the Ubuntu universe (I haven&#8217;t checked yet). I have Mono running, with a few apps (I love Muine) and I miss Tomboy (Tomboy isn&#8217;t working in Hoary for me, no idea why, it was fine in Warty).
