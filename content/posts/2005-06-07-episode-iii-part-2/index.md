I figured out what&#8217;s been bothering me about Episode III. For as much as I love it, it&#8217;s Padme&#8217;s role that bothers me. In Episode I, Queen Amidala was portrayed as a strong character, who loved her planet, and fought the evils of the Trade Federation&#8217;s invasion. In Episode II, she was again a strong character as a Senator, trying to keep the Republic together when the Separtists threatened to destroy it.

In Episode III, her role is to be in love with Anakin. She&#8217;s not shown as a strong political figure anymore, just as someone who questions what side she&#8217;s on. Her love for Anakin is the major plot line, and she&#8217;s, at best, a secondary character relegated to worrying, instead of taking action like she did in the first two movies, whether it was traveling to Coruscant to defend Naboo, or going to rescue Obi-Wan in AOTC.

It&#8217;s too bad really &#8211; she&#8217;s much more emotive in this film, and for as good as an actor as she is, and her two awful performances in the first two (which I blame Lucas for more than her), it&#8217;s too bad too see her relegated to the sidelines in Episode III.

Some other [interesting][1] [thoughts][2] on Episode III.
