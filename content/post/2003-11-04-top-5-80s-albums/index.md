One of my favorite parts of Nick Hornby&#8217;s great book, High Fidelity (and the movie adaption with John Cusack was pretty good too, but his books are better), are his Top 5 lits.

So here&#8217;s my first one. Inspiration hit me last night when flipping through the radio dial (If I hear Coldplay&#8217;s new live song one more time&#8230;.) and I heard Prince&#8217;s Purple Rain.

Here we go, Top 5 Albums (yes, I said albums, this is the 80&#8217;s, and I&#8217;m talking a complete record here, not one with just 2 good songs, in no particular order:

1. Prince &#8211; Soundtrack to Purple Rain
  
2. INXS &#8211; Kick
  
3. Def Leppard &#8211; Hysteria
  
4. Van Halen &#8211; 1984
  
5. Depeche Mode &#8211; 101

There&#8217;s so many other ones that I could mention, but those are my personal faves.
