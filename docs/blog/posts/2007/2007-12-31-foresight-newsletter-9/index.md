The last [Foresight Newsletter of 2007 is out!][1] This one I&#8217;m especially proud of, as I spent some time going back through the wiki, older newsletters and chatting with a few folks about all of of Foresight&#8217;s accomplishments this past year.

You&#8217;ll also get a look at X-Chat, a GNOME IRC Client, contributed by Eric Lake aka etank, updates on the next alpha, and documentation updates for deveopers.

You can subsribe to the newsletter in your [favorite feed reader here][2], and don&#8217;t forget to [Digg it!][3]
