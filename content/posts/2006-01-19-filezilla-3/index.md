My favorite FTP client for Windows, [Filezilla][1], is being ported to Linux for the release of Filezilla 3. [Linuxedge has a preview][2] of Filezilla 3 on Linux built from CVS.

Pretty cool, I&#8217;ve been a big fan of Filezilla for years, though gFTP seems to work fine for me on my Linux desktop. It looks GNOME-HIG compliant, and will be interesting to test out.
