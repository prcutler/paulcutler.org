Two of the more high profile games to be released this year, with already announced Linux versions, have been delayed. Both stories courtesy of [Blue&#8217;s News][1].

Activision&#8217;s latest quarterly statement [highlights ET: Quake Wars has][2] been delayed to their fiscal 2008 year, which runs from April 2007 to March 2008.

Unreal Tournament 2007 has undergone a name change to Unreal Tournament 3, with part of the name change reflecting the title&#8217;s [delay until later in 2007][3], when it was originally scheduled for 2006.

I&#8217;ve built my new machine with a fancy Core Duo, and can&#8217;t wait to play both with native Linux binaries this year. Let&#8217;s hope for no more delays!
