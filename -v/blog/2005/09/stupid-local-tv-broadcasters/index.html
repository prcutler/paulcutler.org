                <p>I missed 45 minutes of Destination: Lost Wednesday night because of a major storm that ripped through the Twin Cities. (It was no Category 3 or higher storm, but it did a little damage).</p>
<p>The local ABC affiliate, Channel 5 KSTP, used the hurricane system and people’s fears of those storms to sensationalize the storm reporting for as long as they could, including 45 minutes of Destination: Lost and the first 20 minutes of the season premiere of Lost.</p>
<p>I have it on my TiVo – it’s just them repeating themselves for an hour – high winds, look at the radar, blah blah blah.</p>
<p>But that gets me to my point: ABC is <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/389/5630010.html">unwilling to re-broadcast the premiere</a> this weekend, due to cast contracts and the residual payouts. At least they’re admitting it’s about the money, so they can screw over their viewers.</p>
<p>Being technologically aware, I just went out and <a href="http://www.torrentspy.com/directory.asp?mode=sub&amp;id=303">downloaded it</a> from an HDTV rip and burned it to DVD. 42 minutes long now and no commercials – just because my local affiliate wouldn’t broadcast it.</p>
<p>And the television industry considers this an illegal act. An over the air television show, currently stored on my TiVo, and I can’t go download a copy and watch it on my TV. I purchased Lost Season One on DVD a week and a half ago. I’ll spend money where it’s deserved, for a quality and innovative program like Lost.</p>
<p>But yet, god forbid you miss one show in a series, you are not supposed to download them. What if it’s a show like Lost, Alias or 24 where you miss one episode and it can seriously set you back in understanding the plot?</p>
<p>The TV industry needs to get with the times then and offer a technological solution if they want to make this illegal. They should be ashamed of themselves for being the Luddites they are. <a href="http://www.eff.org/legal/cases/betamax/">Sony Betamax vs. Universal</a> was settled over 20 years ago and yet here is history repeating itself.</p>
