Back from LA, good trip.

Beautiful weather (mid 80s, 60 at night). Stayed at the Renaissance Hotel in Hollywood, next to the Kodak Theater and Mann&#8217;s Chinese Theater. That was pretty cool being next to where the Oscars take place, and the famous movie theater. I remember the pictures of the Chinese Theater in &#8217;77 when Star Wars opened.

Nice to be home, if still a little jet lagged.
