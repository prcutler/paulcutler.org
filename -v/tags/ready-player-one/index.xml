      <description>If you grew up in the 80s like me, especially as a teenager, Ready Player One is a book for you.
For fans of retro arcade games, 80s music and movies, MMOs, cyberpunk, roleplaying and early computers like the TRS-80, it weaves them all into a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I can’t do it justice, so read the summary here. And then buy it and read it, you won’t be disappointed.</description>
