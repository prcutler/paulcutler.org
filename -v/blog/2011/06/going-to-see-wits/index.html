            <div class="post-content">
                <p>This Friday, my son and I are going to the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul to see the season finale of <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/programs/wits/">Minnesota Public Radio’s Wits series</a>. Each performance features an interview with a cultural icon, a musical guest and other guests. I purchased tickets for this one specifically because of the featured guest: <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/">Neil Gaiman</a>. Mr. Gaiman is touring in support of the tenth anniversary of his first novel, the class <em>American Gods</em>.</p>
<p>I vividly remember the first time I read <em>American Gods</em>. I knew of Neil Gaiman through his groundbreaking comic, <em>Sandman</em>, but <em>American Gods</em> blew me away. I remember thinking, “<em>How does this Englishman know of all these Midwest landmarks?!</em>” And when they stopped at a Culvers just outside of Madison… It wasn’t until a few years later than I learned he had relocated to Wisconsin, not too far from the Minnesota border. The book’s take on mythology and its plot quickly made it a classic.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to see Neil Gaiman speak and do a book signing a few years ago when his last collection of short stories, <em>Fragile Things</em>, was published. He’s an engaging speaker and listening to him read from his stories is a thrill in itself. (I also won the raffle in support of the CBLDF):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/276164059/" title="DSC00872 by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>This week’s musical guess is Josh Ritter and the hosts are John Moe of MPR and <a href="http://www.thenewstandards.com/munson.html">John Munson</a>. Mr. Munson was formerly in the bands Trip Shakespeare and Semisonic. Back in (probably) 1994, for the only time in my life, I won concert tickets on the radio from <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/about/people/mpr_people_display.php?aut_id=121">Mary Lucia</a> at <a href="http://www.pessimistic.com/revolution/radio.htm">Rev105</a> to see a showcase of Minnesota acts at <a href="http://first-avenue.com/">First Avenue</a>. One band in particular, Pleasure, just blew me away – it was one of the tightest bands I’ve ever seen, and I didn’t know a single song. I moved out east and never heard about the band again. A year or two later, a friend from the Twin Cities moved out east to work with me, and I asked him about Pleasure. He excitedly informed me they had changed their name to Semisonic and I bought their debut album the same day. (You probably know them from their big hit, <em>Closing Time</em>).</p>
<p>In addition, guests at Wits this week appearing via the phone include Wil Wheaton, Adam Savage, <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/programs/wits/">and more</a>.</p>
<p>Can’t wait – both for the show and to introduce my son to seeing Neil Gaiman live.</p>
