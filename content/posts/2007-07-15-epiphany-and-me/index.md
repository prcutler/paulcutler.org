A few months ago, I tried out Epiphany for 60 days after a particularily nasty Firefox crash caused me to lose a lot of content I was working on in a wiki page. At the end of the 60 days, I was pretty happy with Epiphany, and impressed with the developers in how they integrated Epiphany in to the GNOME desktop.

However, a few things had me coming back to Firefox:

  1. I have to use WindowsXP at work, and I use Firefox there. I love the [Google Sync extension][1] for sharing my history, cookies and bookmarks between my work computer and my two home computers.
  2. Extensions: I love the [Gmail Manger][2] and [del.icio.us][3] extensions. By far, the most useful two extensions I&#8221;ve come across.
  3. Epiphany&#8217;s default behavior for opening a new tab drives me crazy, as it opens Google, and the cursor sits in the Google search box instead of the URL field to type a new webpage address in to.
  4. And this is very minor, but Mugshot was opening in Firefox by default.
  5. Epiphany would always open in a new window, not a new tab.

After I switched back to Firefox a few weeks ago, it was just eating up too much memory and CPU cycles. Firefox then began pausing while using it when the CPU / memory use would spike, which drove me crazy, so I went back to Epiphany&#8217;s waiting arms one more time.

Since I have switched back, I have also invested some time in customizing Epiphany:

  * Changing the default home page to blank fixes the focus issue I had on the URI line, since Google is no longer the home page, it doesn&#8217;t default to the Google search box. [This plugin][4] does a similar thing as well.
  * Based on the screenshot below, you can see I&#8217;ve added an extra toolbar. Within that toolbar, I&#8217;ve added the &#8220;Post to del.icio.us&#8221; link since the Epilicious plugin is currently broken, which you can get from the del.icio.us home page. I&#8217;ve also added 3 search boxes:
  1. Google: Add a new bookmark when you&#8217;re at Google.com, and then add %s to the end so it looks like this: http://www.google.com/%s Then View Bookmarks, and drag that bookmark to your toolbar.
  2. JIRA: Search the Foresight issue / bug tracker from your toolbar: http://issues.foresightlinux.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa/%s (I may have a typo, I have issues with this one).
  3. Search rBuilder / Foresight to see if a certain package is maintained on rBuilder: http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/search?type=Packages;search=%s&#8221; Great for when folks stop by in IRC looking for a package, and you can tell them to use Conary to install if it&#8217;s there.

  * Make sure you go to System > Preferences > Preferred Applications and have Epiphany chosen as your default web browser, and then click on the radio button for &#8220;Open link in new tab&#8221;. If you have Epiphany, and click on a Mugshot link for example, it will open in Epiphany. Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t found an extension yet to have links in your web browser always open in a tab, ala [Tabbrowser Preferences for Firefox][5]. 

One ongoing complaint, is the dialog box to remember passwords doesn&#8217;t work if I type &#8220;R&#8221; &#8211; I can only use the mouse, even when the dialog box has focus.

The last complaint I have is that the Epilicious and Gmail Notifier plugins are currently broken. I&#8217;m a del.icio.us and Gmail junkie, and those are almost enough for me to go back to Firefox, but I&#8217;ll manage manually.

If you haven&#8217;t tried out Epipany, take the challenge. Give up your other browser for 30 days, and with a few exceptions, Epiphany as just as good any other browser out there, and it integrates with your GNOME experience that much better. I&#8217;m dedicated to using Epiphany, and here is my obligatory screenshot (click through to Flickr to see larger sizes):
