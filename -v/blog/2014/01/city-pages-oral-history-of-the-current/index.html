<p>A few weeks ago I was out watching football with some buddies. I was talking about my new car and how I was disappointed it didn’t have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Data_System">Radio Data System</a> built in, which shows you the song name and title when listening to the radio. “Who still listens to the radio?!” he said. I replied, “I listen to <a href="http://www.thecurrent.org">The Current</a>! We have one of the best public radio stations in the country!” A week or so later, he forwarded me the Arbitron ratings locally to debunk my statement.</p>
<p>As The Current celebrates its ninth birthday, <a href="http://www.citypages.com/2014-01-22/music/89-3-the-current-an-oral-history/">City Pages has published an Oral History of The Current</a>. Featuring former and current employees of <a href="http://www.mpr.org">Minnesota Public Radio</a> and <a href="http://www.thecurrent.org">the station</a>, they talk about the founding of the station; the highs of getting it off the ground; the lows of the rating crash a few years later and bringing in a consultant; and the success they’ve had with both the station, supporting new artists and especially their support of the <a href="http://www.thecurrent.org/local">local music scene</a>. It’s a fantastic read and gives you a rare behind the scenes look at running a radio station.</p>
<p>And to my friend who wanted to argue with me about having one of the best radio stations in the country, the opening paragraphs back me up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, 89.3 the Current celebrates the start of its 10th year, having become the model for cutting-edge radio throughout the country. Not bad for a station built from the ground up in six weeks.</p>
<p>Before the Current hit the airwaves in January 2005, local FM radio was a dead zone, and 89.3 was home to string orchestras. Flash forward to today, and the Current has revitalized the local music scene and been named the country’s best non-commercial radio station by industry peers for four years running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happy 9th birthday, 89.3!</p>
