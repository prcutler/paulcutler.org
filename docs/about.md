# About

Paul lives in the suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota with his wife and his dog, a black Labrador Retriever.
When he's not in front of his computer you can find him listening to records from his vinyl record collection,
tinkering with Python or CircuitPython, playing with his dog, or watching a movie.

Paul co-hosts [The Bootloader](https://thebootloader.net) with [Tod Kurt](https://todbot.com), a monthly podcast
with topics from the maker and CircuitPython communities. Since 2022, he has
hosted [The CircuitPython Show](https://www.circuitpythonshow.com/@circuitpythonshow),
an independent podcast where Paul interviews people doing cool things with CircuitPython or in the maker
community.

Paul believes strongly in the power of open source, both software and hardware. Paul has contributed to a number of open source projects, most notably in the past with GNOME, where he also served as a mentor for Outreachy, for those under represented in tech; and served one term on the GNOME Board of Directors as President and Chairman. Paul is active in the CircuitPython community and writes documentation for a handful of open source projects and is a co-maintainer of [Joalla](https://github.com/joalla/discogs_client), the Python library for the [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com) API. He is also a member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Python Software Foundation.
