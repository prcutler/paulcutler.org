And so it begins. It took me 5 minutes to figure out why [Planet Gnome][1] was showing [Planet KDE][2] this morning, until I visited the Planet KDE site and it hit me that it was April Fool&#8217;s Day.

Davyd Madeley, a Gnome Developer [has one of the funnier ones up][3] that I&#8217;ve seen yet over the years. What if you had to continue to donate to use your desktop? Gives open source development a new lens.

I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll see the usual silly game press releases and what not. I&#8217;ll post any good ones I see.
