A bunch of good stuff this week:

Books:

  * The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale by Margaret Atwood. A cow-orker lent me this to read last week and it was fantastic. A must read, review coming soon.
  * Survivor, Invisible Monsters, and Stranger than Fiction; all by Chuck Palahniuk. Author of Fight Club, Mr. Palahniuk&#8217;s writing style is very unique, and Stranger than Fiction are some non-fiction stories from his time on the road.
  * A Spell for Chameleon, by Piers Anthony. An author near and dear to my heart from my childhood. Last year I picked up the Incarnations series and Bio of a Space Tyrant series from my favorite used book store. A Spell For Chameleon is the first Xanth novel, published in 1977. I&#8217;m going to re-read it and see if Alex is ready for the series.

Music:

  * [Gorillaz][1], Demon Days: Special Editon. From one half of the team formerly known as Blur, Gorillaz&#8217; Demon Days is a fantastic alternative rock album flavored with a bit of hip-hop.
  * Audioslave, Out of Exile. The sophomore effort from Chris Cornell and the former bandmembers of Rage Against The Machine.

Movies:

  * In Good Company. Topher Grace is Dennis Quaid&#8217;s boss, and tries to date his employee&#8217;s daughter as well.
  * The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Wes Anderson&#8217;s (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums) third film, with an ensemble cast. I think the Royal Tenenbaums was one of the final straws for my friends in movies I recommended and made them watch that they hated.
