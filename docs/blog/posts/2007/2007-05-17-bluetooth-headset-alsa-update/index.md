A follow-up to [last night&#8217;s post][1] about Bluetooth adapters on Linux to use a headset with my desktop:

**Breaking News: Foresight Developers can read minds!**_

Serendipity struck, that within an hour of posting, [Ken Vandine][2] pinged me in IRC on #foresight to let me know that earlier in the day, he had [already updated][3] the Bluetooth ALSA packages on Foresight to make this project work.

So not only will Foresight developers package up software if you ask nicely in IRC, I have now learned that Foresight Developers have the ability to read minds, and package software they know their users will want later in the day.

Can your distribution&#8217;s developers read minds? [Get Foresight today!][4]

(Now I&#8217;m off to pickup a bluetooth adapter later today!)
