I have a few different Google accounts I use, including two for email, one for backup, and a Google for Domains account (pcutler at foresightlinux dot org).

I forward all my email to my primary account (silwenae at gmail dot com), and use that account to log in to all my Google services. Within that account, I have selected pcutler at foresightlinux dot org as my main account to send email from, when logged in as silwenae. Gmail makes this all pretty easy from it&#8217;s settings menu within Gmail.

One of the recent challenges I had, is that I&#8217;ve created a couple Google Groups for Foresight mailing lists. Since I was logged in to Google as silwenae, and my default email to send from is pcutler at foresight, I kept getting bounce messages when I&#8217;d try to email the group as I&#8217;d forget that I had to change my send email address in Gmail. So I then created another Google account for pcutler at foresight, subscribed to the group, but now I was subscribed as two different users. It fixed the problem, but wasn&#8217;t elegant.

Yesterday, the [Google Operating System Blog posted about associating another email address][1] with your Google account. Similar to how Gmail allows you to associate another email account (including receiving and sending emails), it allows you to use all of Google&#8217;s services, such as Calendar or Groups, with this account.

I had to delete the new Google account I set up using pcutler @ foresight, and then followed the steps above. Then, in Google Groups, I went to &#8220;Edit my Membership&#8221;, and it asks: What address do you want to use for this group? I selected pcutler @ foresight and voila, all fixed, with a much more elegant solution.

For those of you with @foresightlinux.org accounts, this trick may come in handy.
