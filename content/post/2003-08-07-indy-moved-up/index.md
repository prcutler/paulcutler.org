The Digital Bits <a href=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/#mytwocents>is reporting</a> that the Indiana Jones trilogy has been moved up from 11/4 to 10/21 to avoid competition with Finding Nemo.

Sounds good to me, early Christmas gift incoming!

Bummer the Packer game got called on rain Monday night in the 3rd quarter. But to be honest, we were playing Madden by halftime anyway.

They need their offensive tackles back. Having Favre get hurt in the preseason just isn&#8217;t worth it. Don&#8217;t start him if you don&#8217;t have to. And besides, don&#8217;t the Pack need to figure out who #2 and #3 QBs will be? :yes:
