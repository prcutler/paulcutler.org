I saved up from last week, and splurged this week on all the new stuff that has come out in the last 8 days.

Movies:

  * Blade 3

Music:

  * Aimee Mann
  * Nine Inch Nails
  * Ben Folds
  * Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Soundtrack
  * Ryan Adams
  * G. Love & Special Sauce (slightly older release, but they didn&#8217;t have last week&#8217;s New Order)
  * Mike Doughty (former lead singer for Soul Coughing)

The new Nine Inch Nails and Ben Folds are dual discs, with DVD content on the back of the disc. The Ben Folds dual disc has the entire album in 5.1 and some video content. We&#8217;ll see how good it is.

The new Mike Doughty album is _fantastic_. It&#8217;s been too many years since he&#8217;s made music, and 89.3 had him live last week acoustically so I got a preview then. The new album, produced by Dan Wilson of Semisonic, has blown me away. It&#8217;s much more emotional and raw than his previous work with Soul Coughing.

Next week: Weezer!
