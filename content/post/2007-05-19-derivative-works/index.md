Big Media is nothing if not two-faced about the creation of derivative works. From the music industry busting re-mix artists &#8211; the same artists paid by the industry to promote their artists in dance clubs, to the film industry&#8217;s penchant for remakes. And how many movies made today are born from an original idea? Even this year&#8217;s Best Picture winner, The Departed, is a remake of a Hong Kong film.

[Techdirt takes a look at this issue][1], using the story of the fans who re-made Raiders of the Lost Ark shot for shot starting in 1981 and taking the next 7 summers to complete it. As Techdirt points out, this couldn&#8217;t be done today. The author does a great job in pointing out the irony in the movie business on the subject of copyright.
