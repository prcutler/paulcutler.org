[The WordPress Themes Competition winners have been announced][1]. I&#8217;m torn to what theme I want to use.

I&#8217;m testing [the equix theme][2], which I like as a light colored theme, though I&#8217;m still debating about going back to a dark theme. I don&#8217;t like the mouse cursor, and I don&#8217;t know why it doesn&#8217;t render correct in IE (damn work forcing my browser choice). It works fine in Firefox. I like it&#8217;s clean look though.

&#8230;Must learn more HTML, PHP and CSS.

_Update 6:00 p.m.: Cursor fixed, thank god_
