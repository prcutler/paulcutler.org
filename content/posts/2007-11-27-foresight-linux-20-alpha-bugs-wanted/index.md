Yes, the title is right. Are you running the alpha of Foresight Linux 2.0? We want, no, **need** your bugs!

The alpha has been out for a couple of weeks now, and only [ten bugs have been filed against the alpha][1], with two of them fixed. And I&#8217;d argue a couple more aren&#8217;t really bugs, but enhancements or tasks.

Please, please file bugs against the alpha. This way we know what needs to be fixed or needs improving. A new alpha release should be out sometime in the next week or two as well.

In other bug news, see me or [Kevin][2] if you&#8217;re interested in joining the [QA team and want to help with bug hunting][3]. We have [110 bugs assigned to Distro][4] that need triaging! ([Learn how to triage here.][5])

So please file bugs against the alpha, we want your desktop to be cool (and bug free).
