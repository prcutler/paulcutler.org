  10 years ago (doesn&#8217;t seem that long ago), I was working in Maryland, the first time I was in management.

Our Video Supervisor, Dave, made me this horse as a present, it was a hobby of his, when Alex was born.

Alex wasn&#8217;t a big rider, but Dave was one of the cooler guys I&#8217;ve worked with in all my time at retail. A bit older (especially older than me), he was one of the few that really made me feel welcome after we had moved cross country.

Zoe really likes to rock on the horse, as evident in the grin on her face. Every time she rides, it takes me back to those days, and I think of Dave, one of the best experiences I had for as long as I&#8217;ve been with the Company.
