I&#8217;d like a [Nokia 770][1] please.

The era of handheld, internet browsing tablets is finally here. With an impressive 800&#215;440 resolution, running a customized version of GNOME, this would be perfect for me. I currently keep a laptop in the living room, but rarely use it &#8211; and when I do, it&#8217;s to browse the net while watching TV, and that&#8217;s about it. This is truly what I need. Well, not need, but want. A lot.

Here&#8217;s a [fairly decent review][2] of the 770, by a former editor at OSNews.com.
