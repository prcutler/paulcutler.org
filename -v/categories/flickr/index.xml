      <description>Winter never ends. I just returned home from 10 days in Asia, with a weekend stopover in Japan, staying in Osaka with a day trip to Kyoto.
It’s cold, snowing and blustery in Minneapolis on April 1st, so here’s a photo of a cherry tree just starting to blossom in Kyoto, Japan. We were a week or two early to enjoy the full cherry trees coming in to blossom, but there were a few just starting.</description>

      <description>If you have 10 minutes during the day, and need a pick me up, I highly recommend browsing through Storm Troopin’, a Flickr set of Stormtrooper poses with commentary.
It’s guaranteed to bring a smile to your face.</description>

      <description>There is a Foresight Flickr group I created a while back, for screenshots and conferences. If you have a Flickr account, or want to follow along as the conference progresses, you can find the group here: http://www.flickr.com/groups/foresightlinux/.
pscott has spent a chunk of the day getting Foresight to run on his Asus EeePC – he’s booting Foresight from an external USB hard drive, and had to compile a custom madwifi driver to get wireless to work.</description>

      <title>Flickr launches Photo Printing</title>
      <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2005/10/flickr-launches-photo-printing/</link>

      <description>Flickr has finally begun to offer online printing of photo’s (if you’re in the U.S.). They have a FAQ up, and prices appear to start at $0.20 for 4×6 and go up from there, so it’s competitive. Looking at the Flickr Blog, I see they’re also available for in-store pickup at Target. Very smart.
What’s interesting, is you, as the photo owner, can limit who can order prints from your photo’s.</description>
