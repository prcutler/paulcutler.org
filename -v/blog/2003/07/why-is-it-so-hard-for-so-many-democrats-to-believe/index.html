                <p>That Howard Dean could get the nomination?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/945273.asp?0cv=CB10">This article at MSNBC</a> sums up centrist Democrats’ fears.</p>
<p>Is it really only his anti-war stance? Many, many people believe that the war in Iraq was unjustified – yes we have removed a menace, but it’s how we went about doing it as well.</p>
<p>As many people learn more about Dean, they’ll find out he’s not that far left. Yes, on the war he absolutely is. His health care proposal is excellent – but liberal. His take on gun control is moderate – and some would even say to the right of most centrist Democrats.</p>
<p>But for Democrats to say their worst fear is his nomination and compare that to McGovern, Mondale and Dukakis, that’s a reach.</p>
<p>Let’s face facts – when was the last time a sitting Senator won a presidential election? What do Kerry, Lieberman, or even Edwards offer that’s unique or not a line handed to them from the DLC? And for Lieberman to go on the Today show and sound off yesterday, if that’s not spin, I don’t know what is. Bob Graham has an interesting opportunity, but is he late to the party?</p>
<p>Dean has been consistent. Much more so than any other Democratic hopeful. Yes, he was Governor of a small state – but at least he has hands on experience governing, which I don’t believe the current crop of Senators necessarily do.</p>
<p>I’ll save my Lieberman rant for a later date.</p>
