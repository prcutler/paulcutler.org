And the trend continues of taking websites down and bringing them up.

This time, I&#8217;ve moved my blog from silwenae.net to the newly created paulcutler.org. Why you may ask? I wanted to try out nearlyfreespeech.net in preparation for moving hosting companies. That&#8217;s a different discussion topic all together. Thanks to Fazin once again for the technical support in making it happen this morning.

So much stuff to blog about since the downtime: MPR&#8217;s new radio station, politics, Packers meltdown, and the Badgers too, books, and other stuff. More to come soonish.

I also have a technical blog running on silwenae.com with updates on my travels and travails through my servers.
