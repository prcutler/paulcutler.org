There is a Foresight Flickr group I created a while back, for screenshots and conferences. If you have a Flickr account, or want to follow along as the conference progresses, you can find the group here: <http://www.flickr.com/groups/foresightlinux/>.

pscott has spent a chunk of the day getting Foresight to run on his Asus EeePC &#8211; he&#8217;s booting Foresight from an external USB hard drive, and had to compile a custom madwifi driver to get wireless to work. It runs well &#8211; fairly snappy, and according to him, comparable to the Xandros OS it ships with.
