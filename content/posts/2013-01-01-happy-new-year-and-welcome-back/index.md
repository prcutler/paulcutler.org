Welcome to the revamped paulcutler.org.

I&#8217;m your host, Paul. With January upon us, the blog has officially turned 10(!). One of my New Years resolutions is to blog more &#8211; I only blogged twice last year, but I can&#8217;t tell you the number of ideas I had for blog posts that I saved in Evernote, Google Reader or Pocket / Instapaper. This year I hope to follow through on that a bit more.

With the blog&#8217;s ten year anniversary here, I went back and looked through some of the old blog posts &#8211; and quickly wished I hadn&#8217;t. Maybe that&#8217;s not fair, but I believe my writing style has improved since I first created the blog. The blog has gone through a number of iterations &#8211; first as a place to share whatever I wanted, including technology, digital rights, sports, or gaming. Later, as I became more involved with open source projects, the blog became a place to share news or thoughts about the projects I was involved with. As I became less involved, and with the rise of Twitter, the blog posts tapered off.

I plan to go back to the original premise and share my thoughts and interests on technology, digital rights, tabletop games and anything else that might come to mind. I&#8217;ll share interesting links from around the web &#8211; some you may already have seen and others may be new to you. 

Lastly, I&#8217;ll be talking about music. I&#8217;ve always been an avid music fan, but a few years ago I bought my first turntable and got into vinyl in a big way. I started a music blog, which also has suffered from a lack of posts in the last year. I&#8217;ll be combining the blogs and only using the blog at paulcutler.org going forward, so this is also where I&#8217;ll be talking about music.

In preparation for 2013, I&#8217;ve spent some time re-designing the [home page][1] and the blog. But we&#8217;ll save that for another post. You have to have a reason to want to come back, right?
