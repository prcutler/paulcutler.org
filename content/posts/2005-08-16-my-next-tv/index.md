As seen on [Gizmodo][1] today, Sony has unleashed a [press releasing introducing the KDS-R60XBR1 and KDS-R50XBR1 Grand WEGA][2] LCOS televesions.

> Sony Electronics today introduced two new sets in the line based on the acclaimed Silicon X-tal (Crystal) Reflective Display (SXRDâ„¢) technology delivering full 1920 x 1080 high-definition resolution.

1920&#215;1080 in 1080p is a beautiful thing. Featuring 2 HDMI inputs, 3 Firewire, and one VGA input, I can plug in almost anything. Running the V for Vendetta trailer in full blown 1920x1080p on a PC through the VGA input should be stunning. Also features a memory stick reader for photos.

I&#8217;ve been hearing from a good friend about this TV for quite some time, it&#8217;s nice to see it&#8217;s official. This is the same chipset in their current 70&#8243; $25,000 set and is now being released for the rest of us at normal pricing of $4000 and $5000 (thank god!).
