Trumping Microsoft in the aesthetics department, the [Playstation3 was unveiled tonight][1].

Gorgeous, sleek design (with the exception of the controller, blech), in 3 colors, with more connectivity than you&#8217;d ever think you need: 6 USB, 3 Ethernet, 6 Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (for PSP!) and best of all&#8230;2 HD outputs.

Check it:

> Speaking of video, Sony Computer Entertainment&#8217;s Chief Technical Officer Masa Chatani was on hand to show off the PS3&#8217;s panoramic video functions. Since the console has two HD outputs, it is can be hooked up to two side-by-side HDTVs to projecting video in a 32:9 extra-widescreen format (think Cinemascope in your living room). Like a gigantic version of the Nitnendo DS, the dual digital outputs also allow for an extended game display, with the action on one screen and either game information or video chat on the second.

With just a little less system memory than X-Box 360, and launching 4-6 months later, it will be interesting to see the big bad mega-corporations duke it out.
