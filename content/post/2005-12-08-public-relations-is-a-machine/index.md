I try not to talk about work on the blog for a number of reasons, one being that I work in Marketing for a Fortune 100 company. There are times when my personal beliefs might clash with my corporate responsibilities.

However, with that said, [here is a fascinating story about the power of public relations firms][1].

As someone who has used PR as a tactic, the article is pretty damn close to the truth. This paragraphy in particular struck me, and I thought the author&#8217;s conclusions about PR and the blogosphere are right on. I&#8217;ll leave you with the quote:

> I didn&#8217;t realize, till there was an alternative, just how artificial most of the writing in the mainstream media was. I&#8217;m not saying I used to believe what I read in Time and Newsweek. Since high school, at least, I&#8217;ve thought of magazines like that more as guides to what ordinary people were being told to think than as sources of information. But I didn&#8217;t realize till the last few years that writing for publication didn&#8217;t have to mean writing that way. I didn&#8217;t realize you could write as candidly and informally as you would if you were writing to a friend.
