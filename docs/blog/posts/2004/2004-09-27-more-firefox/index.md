Man, after using Firefox for months, and especially after Firefox PR1, it&#8217;s harder and harder to use IE.

Especially after installing [extensions][1] to make Firefox better. I can&#8217;t recommend [the Adblock extension][2] enough. While it&#8217;s a bit of a bear at first getting the ad blacklist created, it&#8217;s gorgeous to use on sites you surf a lot. (Basically you&#8217;ll see a little &#8220;Adblock&#8221; button on ads, click that and it blocks the ad on a per site basis. It also has the ability to do recursive directories or wildcards to block lots of stuff).

Between the extensions, built-in pop up blocking, and tabbed browsing, the best browser gets even better. I&#8217;ve also installed the Gmail checker, and [Web Developer][3] extensions.
