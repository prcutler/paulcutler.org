I will spare you the gory details, but that was the worst deployment I've ever been through for one of my personal projects.  I'm not a system administrator nor do I pretend to play one on TV, but I can usually get around a cloud server.

Not this time.  For whatever reason, I couldn't get FastAPI to load, then I had SSL issues, and then and then four days later it's finally over.

It's [up now](https://silversaucer.com). The `Today` and `Play` pages are coming soon.  Just the two random buttons work for now, but it's progress.

The next two big tasks are getting MQTT up and running and displaying a picture on the 64x64 matrix.  Progress on those as well, more soon.
