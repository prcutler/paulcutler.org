My new T61 laptop is freezing, typically after 5-10 minutes of inactivity, but every once in a while I&#8217;m using it. It seems as if I&#8217;m actively using it, it won&#8217;t freeze up, but soon as I stop, within 5-10 minutes it just hard locks. I&#8217;ve used my T61 up to two hours without lock-ups, set it aside, and bam, frozen.

I&#8217;ve [browsed through the /var/logs/messages file][1] a number of times, but I don&#8217;t see anything in the file &#8211; just the reboot messages. I spent 3 hours last night running [Memtest86][2], and my memory passed all the tests. I also re-formatted and re-installed Foresight a second time. I can&#8217;t figure it out.

I would really hate to have to re-install Vista to see if it happens there too before calling Lenovo&#8217;s warranty service.

Anyone have any ideas?
