What&#8217;s on President Bush&#8217;s iPod, you might be wondering?

[CNN is here to let you know][1].

> The playlist does reveal a rather narrow range of babyboomer tunes. Writing in the London Times, Caitlin Moran noted: &#8220;No black artists, no gay artists, no world music, only one woman, no genre less than 25 years old, and no Beatles.&#8221;

Why am I not surprised?
