Finally the jinx is broken with the Pack and Badgers winning in the same weekend (only took them a month!)

Ahman green dominated Chicago as the Green & Gold spoiled the new grand opening of Soldier Field.

Now let&#8217;s see if the Pack can keep it up against the Seahawks and Chiefs over the next 2 weeks &#8211; and I&#8217;ll be there to cheer them on!
