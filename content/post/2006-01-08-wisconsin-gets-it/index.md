Gov. Jim Doyle of Wisconsin [signed into law][1] a bill requiring any vendor who provides electronic voting machines _must_ provide the code that runs on those machines.

This, combined with paper copies of the vote you cast for (which Wisconsin also requires) are a must when it comes to electronic voting. Not just to avoid the fraud as seen in Ohio in 2004, or as a check against corrupt CEOs who publicly say they&#8217;ll do everything in their power to see an election go a certain way and they also just happen to provide e-voting machines, but the code and paper voting provide trust to the end user that their vote counts.
