            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I’ve been on a bit of a buying spree for CD’s over the last month or two, especially picking up a lot of indie bands.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The New Pornographers, Challengers: One of the best albums I’ve bought in a long time. I’ve always like the New Pornographers, but it wasn’t a disc I would spin over and over. This disc is amazing – Neko Case and the whole gang did a heck of a job writing some very memorable songs that are guaranteed to get stuck in your head. My favorite track by far is All the Old Showstoppers.</li>
<li>Rilo Kiley, Under the Blacklight: I bought this and the Challengers on the same day, and both of these have vied for the same playing time, with Under the Blacklight probably getting the edge in total playtime. I was introduced to Rilo Kiley a few years ago on 89.3 The Current, and ended up getting their last release free from the station at a volunteer opportunity. I really liked, but this disc is a major step forward. The title track, Under the Blacklight, 15, Smoke Detector and Give a Little Love are standout tracks. (I also picked up Take Offs and Landings, their second album but first released commercially.)</li>
<li>Interpol, Antics: Very similar to their last album, but it seems a touch more mellow. I need to listen to this one more.</li>
<li>Tegan and Sara, The Con: I absolutely adored their last disc, but this one doesn’t live up to that. The Con is more of a concept album, and while not a departure from the twins’ signature sound, it doesn’t have the 2 or 3 songs that you couldn’t get out of your head that So Jealous did.</li>
<li>Fountains of Wayne, Traffic and Weather: I don’t think these guys get the credit they deserve. They write catchy pop alternative songs with interesting lyrics, but all that everyone remembers them for is “Stacy’s Mom”. Good album, on par with their last effort.</li>
<li>Dolores O’Riordan, Are You Listening?: The former frontwoman for the Cranberries unleases a solo album that was 3 or 4 years in the making, and it was worth the wait. If you ever liked the Cranberries even just a little, pick this up. Ms. O’Riordan’s songwriting and lyrics have matured, and this album has it all, from mellow to rockin’ out.</li>
<li>Garbage, Absolute Garbage (Special Edition): Greatest hit collection from the alternative band from Madison, WI. I’ve seen Garbage live a few times, and they have always been one of my favorite bands. From Butch Vig’s catchy pop sound to Shirley Manson growling or purring, Garbage is the real thing. I made sure to pick up the Special Edition and get the second disc of remixes, which were a bit of a disapopintment. But I’ll give it to Garbage, the songs collected for the greatest hits album were perfect.</li>
<li>The Donna’s, Bitchin’: The follow up to Gold Medal, this all girl band left their label and is publishing this independently. They’ve cranked the amps up to 11 for this album, and are rocking even harder. What I love about this album is the classic 80’s hair band feel The Donna’s bring. While not over the top, most songs are anthem rock songs without going too over the top. I highly recommend this album. (I have a friend who digs The Donna’s for the song Take it Off from the Gold Medal release, as he can play it on Guitar Hero).</li>
<li>White Light Riot, Atomism: This local band from Minneapolis has been getting some airplay on 89.3, and have an indie sound that’s a little harder than some of the current indie favorites out there, and a couple of the songs are pretty catchy. Due to some of the favorites above I haven’t listened to it as much as I’ve wanted, but I’ve been happy the few times so far that I have.</li>
<li>Bruce Springsteen, Magic: I was blown away by Radio Nowhere, the first single from the album, and unfortunately the rest of the album doesn’t sound like it. I’m a Springsteen fan though, and while the rest of the songs don’t rock as hard as that one as it mellows out a bit, the rest of the album is good. If you liked The Rising, you’ll like this release.</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to go buy the new Radiohead album off their website now. I’ve also been poking around Amazon’s store, and they are promising an album downloader for Linux. I’m really looking to give that a try. But more on physical vs. digital another time.</p>
