      <description>Summer is the slow time for new music releases and August saw a number of great new releases, with even more coming later this fall.
Here’s some of the new releases I picked up on vinyl in August:
 Superchunk – I Hate Music: The alt rockers have been around since 1989(!) and I Hate Music is their tenth album. The album is short and sweet, clocking in at just over 37 minutes.</description>

      <description>Welcome back!
July 25th is a big day for new music. If you’re not reading the Largeheartedboy blog for new music releases, including where you can stream the new releases for free before buying (which usually comes out on Wednesdays), you should be. The list of today’s releases can be found here.
Albums I’ve purchased this week include:
Passion Pit’s Gossamer: If you’re a fan of the first album, you’ll love their second album.</description>
