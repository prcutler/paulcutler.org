I finally got the RSS feed to work on Silwenae.com for this blog. Added the EFF RSS feed as well.

For whatever reason, the Gadsden Flag post below is dated on the site as 2-3 &#8212; but it&#8217;s 2/14. No idea why it did that.

Still can&#8217;t get the NWN server up. Slivers emailed me some ideas to try. I&#8217;ll get to that this weekend.
