The Foresight Council, aka Focus, which holds bi-weekly meetings on Fridays, is opening the meetings to all community members! This topic was discussed at yesterday&#8217;s Focus meeting, and all three council members were unanimous in supporting it.

Get a peek of what&#8217;s going on inside Foresight, from current development, future development, sub-teams goings on, and community updates.

Here are the [meeting notes from yesterday&#8217;s meeting][1], and we&#8217;ll see you in #foresight-council on Freenode IRC at our next meeting on June 6th at 9 a.m. EST. For more information on the Foresight Council, see the [Focus homepage][2] on the Foresight wiki.
