I&#8217;m sometimes criticized for my liberal beliefs. That doesn&#8217;t bug me, especially in these times. Without getting into politics, one of the favorite ways to poke fun at me is for my technology views, especially when they&#8217;re viewed as paranoia. (See the links on right hand side of [Silwenae.com][1].)

However, there is a [story up at Kuro5hin][2] discussing spyware, adware, and digital rights management. The article starts out with good definitions of each and then some editorial content. While the article tries to delicately avoid all-out Microsoft bashing, there is some, but the article describes very well the state of digital rights today, and some of the things being done to curtail our fair use rights.

So go ahead and make fun of me for using Linux. But at least read the article and understand some of the concerns. While parts of the article might be on the edge, some parts are right on, and these things paint a picture of what could come &#8211; if we don&#8217;t speak up.
