Like [last year](https://www.paulcutler.org/posts/2023/12/favorite-albums-of-2023/) and the [year before](https://paulcutler.org/posts/2022/12/favorite-albums-of-2022/), hereâ€™s the list in no particular order:

* The Staves - All Now: The trio of sisters returned as a duo on their latest album.  The melodies are still sweet and the songs are catchy.
* Japandroids - Fate & Alcohol: The duo return and it's exactly what you expect: loud and fast.  It's their fourth and final album and I will miss them deeply.
* Passage du Desir - Johnny Blue Skies: Sturgill Simpson returns under a new name and his fusion of rock, country, and bluegrass does not disappoint.
* Waxahatchee - Tigers Blood: This alt-country gem is on a lot of end of year lists for good reason.

Favorite Find: Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis.  I was floored when I received the weekly email newsletter from my 
local record store with this album in the restocks section.  I had a different version in my wantlist on Discogs for years, 
and somehow missed this version, which seems to be fairly common.  I rushed to Down in the Valley and picked it up right away.
