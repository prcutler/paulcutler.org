What&#8217;s that? You follow [planet.gnome.org][1] but not [news.gnome.org][2]? For shame &#8211; we have a [blog for the GNOME Documentation team][3] but I guess this once I can [cross-post][4] for you.

We&#8217;re [having a meeting tomorrow at 19:00 UTC in #docs on irc.gimp.org][5] to start planning the topics and task for GNOME 3.0. We have big things (like GNOME Shell) to document and lots of little topics to tackle as we break up the old GNOME User Guide and organize it better.

As the post on the Docs blog says &#8211; now is a great time to get involved &#8211; even if you don&#8217;t know Docbook or Mallard, the important thing is to write the new user help and we&#8217;re here to help you learn.

See you there!
