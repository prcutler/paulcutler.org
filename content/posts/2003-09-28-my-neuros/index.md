So after, what, 2 months? I got my [Neuros portable MP3 player][1] working with Ogg files!

Using the latest beta firmware (1.40a), and the [Neuros Database Manager][2], an open source Java interface for the Neuros, Ogg files seem to be working fine.

Pretty darn cool.

Now I just have to:

  * Mow the grass with the 128mb player today
  * Get the 20GB Backpack working
  * Load it for my trip to Columbus this week
  * Get MyFi working for my drive to Green Bay next weekend
  * Listen to Oggs!
