      <description>Part 1: Setting up Azure Pipelines with SSH keys Part 2: Setting up Azure Pipelines (or watching it work on Python 3.6 and fail on Python 3.7) Part 3: Finishing Setup  It turns out that all the problems I was having for about ten days in trying to learn Azure Pipelines for continuous integration that I briefly touched on in Part 2 had nothing to do with me. There was a bug in Azureâ€™s hosted images of Ubuntu used in the CI pipeline that did not include SQLite, as Python lists it as an optional module.</description>

      <description>Part 1: Setting up Azure Pipelines with SSH keys Part 2: Setting up Azure Pipelines (or watching it work on Python 3.6 and fail on Python 3.7)  Using Dependabot to manage Python dependencies All I want is to start coding. I want to learn how to write a Pyramid app the correct way and also to start learning pytest. There&amp;rsquo;s just one more thing to do and one to tweak in Azure and then it&amp;rsquo;s time for the fun part - the actual learning and coding.</description>

      <description>In Part 1, I covered the challenges I had in setting up my SSH key with Azure Pipelines to work with my existing Github repository, which contains a new Pyramid project without any customization (yet).
Now that Azure Pipelines could build my project, I spent the last week after that trying to figure out why builds would fail on Azure with Python 3.7, not with Python 3.6 or on my local development machine.</description>
