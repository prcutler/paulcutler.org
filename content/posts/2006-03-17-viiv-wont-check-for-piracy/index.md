I&#8217;ve been following Intel&#8217;s new Viiv platform for a while, and Intel confirmed some details this week at a launch event. Viiv is Intel&#8217;s latest platform, specifically to enable Media Center functionality in the desktop and in homes. From transcoding ability built-in, automatic driver updates, and ability to transfer content to other devices, Intel is betting that&#8217;s it&#8217;s the cornerstone of the future home.

The good news is that the hardware won&#8217;t check for DRM and watermarks natively. [From the CNet Australia article:][1]

> Interestingly, MacDonald also told CNET.com.au that Viiv won&#8217;t be testing to see if the content being played is pirated from networks such as BitTorrent. He believes that it&#8217;s not Intel&#8217;s job to be policing downloads and that it&#8217;s wrong to assume that &#8220;all consumers are criminals&#8221;. As such, Viiv won&#8217;t test for &#8220;watermarks&#8221; or other red flags that reveal pirated content, allowing any type of media to be played.

> Ultimately, though, MacDonald is confident that piracy won&#8217;t be a significant issue for Viiv, as Intel promises to &#8220;make content easier to buy than it is to pirate&#8221;.
