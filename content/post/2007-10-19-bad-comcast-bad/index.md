It&#8217;s been rumored for a while that Comcast was filtering traffic on it&#8217;s network, specifically Bittorrent, and now the AP after significant testing, according to this [story on MSNBC.com.][1]

I&#8217;m extremely disappointed to have this confirmed. After Time Warner and Comcast swapped markets a year ago, I&#8217;m now a Comcast subscriber. Time Warner and it&#8217;s Roadrunner service was an excellent internet provider &#8211; a number of years ago when I was running a home server, I received an email from Time Warner. It informed me they noticed I was running a mail server, which was against it&#8217;s TOS, but they probed and it wasn&#8217;t compromised, and they let it be.

Comcast, on the other hand, within 3 months of taking over service, jacked up my rates by 30% (from $45 / month to $60 / month), on the premise I only had their broadband service, and not their TV or phone service, but would leave my rates at $45 if I signed up for one of those. (I still don&#8217;t understand how this isn&#8217;t illegal tying&#8230; I really wish I had gone to law school.)

As a Linux developer, Bittorrent is a legitimate file sharing service. I can share ISOs of the software I contribute to. Bittorrent is not just a copyright infringing service.

Comcast needs to wake up and smell the coffee.

Support [net neutrality][2], and [learn more][3]. Call your Senators and Congressional representatives, and don&#8217;t let big business ruin the internet.
