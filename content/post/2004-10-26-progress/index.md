Finally figured out what&#8217;s hanging my linux box &#8211; [GAIM][1], my IM client. Can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m shocked, there have been a ton of updates lately.

It&#8217;s driving me pretty close to using [Ubuntu Linux][2] though. I&#8217;ve tried Debian, Gentoo, and have been (and still am) a long time user of Red Hat & Fedora. The box currently has Fedora Core 2 on it, and Fedora Core 3 hasn&#8217;t come out fast enough for me.

[Gnome 2.8][3] is sexy.

Ubuntu, as a Debian derivative is very interesting me. 6 month release cycles (similar to Fedora), tied to Gnome releases, which are 6 months as well (close, but not quite similar to Fedora).

I am very excited about the community aspect of Ubuntu &#8211; Debian with all the updates, contributed back to the Debian core teams, funded by a .com millionaire to make a great Linux distro. As a huge Gnome fan, their Gnome integration looks (from the outside) fabulous. All the power of apt-get, with the power of Debian.

I always hated the Debian installer &#8211; I had to actually get help at a [TCLUG][4] installfest to get installed (damn network). Ubuntu looks to take some of that complexity away. In addition, their interesting choice of using sudo instead of a root account is intriguing.

I tried their pre-release on my laptop, but it wouldn&#8217;t boot, but I&#8217;m sure it was ACPI related. I just didn&#8217;t spend the 15 minutes needed to find the boot command. I burned the final version last week &#8211; I&#8217;m going to get on my linux box as I backed up my music and email a day or two ago, and then my laptop and AMD64 box right after that.

More to come.
