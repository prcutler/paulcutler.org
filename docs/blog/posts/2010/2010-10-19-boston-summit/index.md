I&#8217;m coming to the [Boston Summit][1] for the first time. My primary purpose is to attend the [Snowy Hackfest][2] but I&#8217;m looking forward to to seeing the GNOME community, talking to [Jason Clinton about GNOME 3.0 videos][3] for GNOME 3.0 marketing and seeing my fellow board members.

Are you coming? Take a look at the [GNOME Foundation blog for more][4].

See you in two weeks!
