I can&#8217;t think of many worse ways to start a week than to read [Bryen&#8217;s blog post][1] this morning about having his equipment stolen as he travels to the Accessibility conference and hackfest. I was impressed to see how many of my friends shared the post in Google Reader to pass the news on.

I pinged Stormy to see if there was something we can do and and she let me know my co-worker [Stephen Shaw was already on it][2]. Stephen has set up a [Pledgie to collect donations][3] to help Bryen out. I&#8217;m pretty excited as I went out to lunch and after coming back I see we&#8217;re already halfway past the goal!

I first met Bryen almost a year ago at the first GNOME Marketing Hackfest in Chicago. It was great meeting him in person and understanding how he used GNOME gave me a better understanding for how important GNOME&#8217;s support for accessibility is. Since then, I&#8217;ve worked and talked with Bryen about GNOME marketing and openSUSE marketing and have really enjoyed working with him.

If you have a few dollars you can spare, [please think about donating][3]. Thanks!
