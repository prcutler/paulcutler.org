Will tomorrow be the day Mike Sherman loses his GM responsibilities?

Will he be able to transition to &#8220;just&#8221; being a coach?

Will he be happy if he doesn&#8217;t get a contract extension as he enters the final year of his contract next year?

Will he even be our coach after next season?

I guess we&#8217;ll find out some of these answers tomorrow! Change is good. We don&#8217;t need more disappointment from the Packers. Sherman&#8217;s record is amazing, but his lack of success in the postseason is very disturbing. I don&#8217;t question his drive, his motivation and his will to win. But when is it too much for one person? It will take change to get to the next level, so change is good.
