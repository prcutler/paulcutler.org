      <description>I just got back from a business trip where we took a customer down to Key West, Florida. I’m not much of an outdoorsman, but we had an event where we went deep sea fishing.
I caught a 45″ barracuda – the first mate said it was one of the biggest catches he’s seen in a few years. I also learned I really enjoy jet skiing. Fun trip!</description>
