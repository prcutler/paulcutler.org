![GNOME 2.28 - Made to Share!][1]

GNOME 2.28 came out right on time yesterday! Improvements include Bluetooth support, tons of feature enhancements in Empathy (and all new documentation using Mallard!), and Webkit in Epiphany. But don&#8217;t take my word for it &#8211; go [read the release notes][2]!

Speaking of release notes, it was the first time I&#8217;ve helped write them, and and it was pretty cool to see the GNOME community working together from a front row seat. A special thanks to Dannielle for giving me pointers on how to get started, Frederic and Andre for all my questions during the process in the #docs channel, and everyone who helped review them and gave feedback to make them better. It was also pretty neat to see the translators at work &#8211; everytime I&#8217;d refresh the website to proofread or do a git pull there were more and more translations available. And one last thank you to Bastien and Guillame for providing [quotes in the press release][3], which is the first time we&#8217;ve included quotes from developers as far as I know (or at least in recent memory).

I&#8217;ve enjoyed reading the various coverage on the web, but I did want to correct one small point that [some][4] [are][5] [reporting][6] &#8211; the decision to make GNOME 2.30 into GNOME 3.0 won&#8217;t be made until November, so it&#8217;s not a safe assumption that 2.28 is the last 2.x release. The release team will consider a number of factors, and it&#8217;s possible 2.32 could be 3.0 instead.

Congrats again to all the GNOME developers, contributors, and translators for a job well done.
