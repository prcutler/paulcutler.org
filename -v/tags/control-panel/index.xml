      <description>Kelly needed to replace the blade in the saw and she cut me a new piece of wood to use as a prototype for the control panel. (At some point, I&amp;rsquo;m going to need to learn to use the saws!) After carefully paying attention to using the right size drill bit, my board looks like this:
Kelly then took a turn at doing it herself, and hers ended up the same way, so I don&amp;rsquo;t feel too bad.</description>

      <description>If I don&amp;rsquo;t improve my attention to detail, I&amp;rsquo;m going to waste a lot of time and money. Case in point: just trying to build a prototype for the control panel so I can figure out how to use the Ipac controller and arcade buttons.
The first prototype I built 18 months ago I built upside down. I tried to fix it, but it was just uncomfortable to use.
The second control panel I drilled the holes the wrong size.</description>
