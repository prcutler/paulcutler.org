Christer Edwards (aka Zelut) recently represented GNOME at the Utah Open Source Conference. He&#8217;s got some great pictures up and has some good things to say about GNOME, including that he&#8217;s getting involved more (which is great to see!)

[Read his full blog post (with pictures) here][1].

Christer and I were also recently talking about how we can expand GNOME usergroups in the US &#8211; he&#8217;s got some great ideas and experience. Still formulating my thoughts, expect a blog post soon on that as well.
