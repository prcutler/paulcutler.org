I have multiple websites through [Dotster][1] and [GoDaddy][2], and typically register with whomever is cheapest, and then jump to a different registrar at renewal time to again keep costs down. I&#8217;ve been happy with GoDaddy&#8217;s renewal fees, as the registrars usually try to charge you double to renew vs. registering a domain, and GoDaddy usually charges the same price.

However, with paulcutler.org up for renewal, they&#8217;ve screwed the pooch pretty bad on this one. A copy of my (fairly nice) email is below, we&#8217;ll wait for their response. According to their [support website][3] their phone hold time is 17 minutes, and average email response time is 9 hours. As it&#8217;s not mission critical as the site is up now, we&#8217;ll see how their email response is.

Here&#8217;s my email / letter:

> Dear GoDaddy Customer Service Representative:
> 
> I wanted to make you aware of a problem I had with your service. I visited my domain early this morning (7 a.m. CST) and I received a GoDaddy Parked Domain page. Logging in to my account at GoDaddy, it showed my domain expiring on 1-4-2006.
> 
> Unfortunately, my office network blocks webmail, so I was unable to visit Gmail to double check my last email from GoDaddy. I then assume assumed the domain had expired as the GoDaddy account page showed, and GoDaddy had given me a week before parking the domain, as it had worked last night. I then renewed the domain for another 2 years through GoDaddy early this morning.
> 
> Upon returning home tonight from work, my domain was working again, and I checked my GoDaddy account and Gmail. Sure enough, I have a receipt from GoDaddy in Gmail showing I renewed this domain on 12-8-2005 for 2 years, and my GoDaddy account now showed my domain was now renewed through 2010.
> 
> Please explain to me why my domain was parked when I renewed over a month ago. I feel taken now that I&#8217;ve renewed for an additional 2 years on top of my renewal in December and you have even more of my money. I&#8217;m extremely disappointed in your level of service, specifically in not displaying my account information correctly.

> Sincerely,
>
