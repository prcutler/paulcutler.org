So here I am watching NFL football.. watching the CBS feed on NFL Ticket and Kevin Smith pops in a commercial for Jersey Girl.

Holy crap was it funny &#8211; he holds up a picture of his wife, says how hot she was and a guy who looks like him needs the bling bling to keep her. So buy his movie. And help a fat guy out.

His self-deprecating humor cracks me up.

On a related note, I watched Jersey Girl this past Tuesday.

It was one of his better films, and very much unlike anything he has done before. While hints of his style and his older films were there (the jokes in the beginning, the 80s references, the obligatory Star Wars reference) the story was touching without being too sweet. And as much of a hard time as Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez got / get, I thought they had amazing chemistry on screen. (Don&#8217;t worry, she dies early in the flim). George Carlin has acting chops few know about, and the the girl who plays Gertie was a great actress for one so young. I highly recommend it.
