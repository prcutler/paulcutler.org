Still trying to get IcculusNews to work for the frontpage of Silwenae.net&#8230; Kelly helped take a look at it, but we need to look at it again so I can mail the email list to see if the problem with the daemon can be fixed.

I&#8217;m going to try to install IcculusFinger this weekend, it&#8217;s better documented, so we&#8217;ll see what happens.

If you use my music site, the new [Quintessential][1] 4.02 didn&#8217;t stream Ogg correctly. I worked with the developer, and the new Ogg input plugin fixes the bug for streaming Ogg. [Get it here][2]. Just a self-extracting exe file that will update Quintessential for you.

Set up a blog here for Alex (as you can see at the top of the page). Now I have to show him how to use it. It will be interesting to see how fast a 7 year old picks it up.

I was thinking about that, and when I got my first computer. (We had a Timex Sinclair &#8211; 2 of &#8217;em eventually). I think I was about 7 or 8 when we first picked that up. I remember getting computer magazines and coding machine language by hand to play Breakout. (Which probably explains my addiction to [lbreakout2][3] on Linux). <img src='https://i0.wp.com/www.silwenae.net/blogs/img/smilies/graysmilewinkgrin.gif?w=700' alt='&#59;&#68;' class='middle' data-recalc-dims="1" />

I did purchase an original Timex Sinclair off Ebay last year along with an Apple //c and monitor. Gotta get that basement finished so I can set up my mini-museum of computers I used growing up. Just have to find a 286 at some point as well. And maybe a P100 at some point (had a Packard Bell once we could afford a computer, and that upgrade cycle with it started all of my learning&#8230;)
