[Boing Boing][1] is full of random goodness today.

First, [BB has a link][2] to [Found Item Clothing][3], who has re-created the shirts from the movie Real Genius that Chris Knight (played by Val Kilmer wore).

Next, [BB points out][4] that William Gibson (of Neuromancer and other books&#8217; fame) has [started blogging][5] again.

It looks like the current election cycle has gotten to him. Let me quote one of the jokes he has up on his site:

> President Bush goes to an elementary school to talk about the war.
> 
> After his talk, he offers to answer questions. One little boy puts up his hand and the president asks him his name.
> 
> &#8220;I&#8217;m Billy, sir.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;And what&#8217;s your question, Billy?&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;I have three questions, sir. Why did the US invade Iraq without the support of the UN? Why are you President when Al Gore got more votes? And whatever happened to Osama Bin Laden?&#8221;
> 
> Just then the bell rings for recess. Bush announces that they&#8217;ll continue after recess.
> 
> When they return, Bush asks, &#8220;OK, where were we? Question time! Who has a question?&#8221;
> 
> Another little boy raises his hand. The president asks his name.
> 
> &#8220;I&#8217;m Steve, sir.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;And what&#8217;s your question, Steve?&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;I have five questions, sir. Why did the US invade Iraq without the support of the UN? Why are you President when Al Gore got more votes? Whatever happened to Osama Bin Laden? Why did the recess bell go off twenty minutes early? And what the heck happened to Billy?&#8221;
