I&#8217;ve been meaning to write this for the last day or two, but I went out lunch Thursday to a Vietnamese restaraunt, and had [Pho][1] for the first time. Pho has been on my [list][2] of things to try since I joined the respective mailing list.

A Vietnamese soup, [quite][3] [popular][4]  [in the US][5] as well, Pho is one of the few Vietnamese dishes not served family style.

Typically made with beef, it&#8217;s a soup served in a large bowl with rice noodles, beef, and a number of assorted spices. This particular restaraunt had it&#8217;s choice from beef, meatballs, tripe, beef strips, rare steak, and a few others I can&#8217;t remember. On the recommendation of the waitress I had the beef and meatballs. It was excellent &#8211; can&#8217;t wait to fnd another restaraunt to try it out.
