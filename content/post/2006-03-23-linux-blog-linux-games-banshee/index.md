I came across a new Linux Blog, [Linux Revolution][1], that has two posts up, near and dear to my heart:

[An overview of next-gen Linux games][2], looking at some of the lesser known games by smaller studios. Some of these I have tried (or installed), including Sauerbraten, and some more I&#8217;m definitely going to keep my eye on.

The second article of note is [Rhythmbox vs. Banshee][3]. This is an article I&#8217;ve been meaning to write myself for some time, but I&#8221;m lazy, and haven&#8217;t got to it. It&#8217;s a good overview of the two music players for GNOME, and like the author, I&#8217;m a huge Banshee fan. Banshee&#8217;s development has been fast and furious, and every release adds key features. I can&#8217;t recommend Banshee enough.
