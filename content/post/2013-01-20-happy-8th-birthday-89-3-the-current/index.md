It feels like yesterday that [Minnesota Public Radio][2] announced they would be launching their own indie rock station with a focus on local music. [89.3 The Current][3] hired a number well known of on-air personalities who had worked in the Twin Cities for years, with experience at Rev105, RadioK and more, which just added to the excitement. Giddy with anticipation, I donated to MPR, becoming a founding member even before the station had launched. (Getting a free vinyl record to celebrate from The Current was just a bonus &#8211; who knew that I would get back into vinyl just a few years later and would make this the first record I would listen to after I bought a turntable).

And here we are eight years later already! For the last few years The Current throws a big birthday bash at the legendary [First Avenue][4]. I had to pass up tickets to the second night show on Saturday (twice) and as I followed the event on Twitter, I had to kick myself. In addition to an awesome line-up of Now, Now, Dave Pirner (of Soul Asylum), and Cloud Cult, the special surprise guest was the YN Rich Kids, the summer&#8217;s hottest local sensation.

You haven&#8217;t heard of them? A good friend of mine hadn&#8217;t either as I texted him at the show.

If you missed it over the summer, this video went viral in the Twin Cities in a big way. Time Magazine even named it the [#7 best music video of 2012][5] and The Current gave it some radio coverage, too.

I knew I should have bought tickets when I had the chance! Well, there is always next year&#8230;

Happy Birthday 89.3! Keep on rockin&#8217;!
