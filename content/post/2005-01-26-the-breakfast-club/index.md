John Hughes&#8217; seminal teenage movie, The Breakfast Club, turns 20 next month. I stumbled across [an article on the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel][1] discussing the film&#8217;s anniversary. It briefly covers the movie, and also 5 things you might not know, 5 things that would be different, and 5 reasons why it&#8217;s still relevant.

The Breakfast Club still remains my favorite John Hughes movie, but Pretty in Pink has to be a close second. The Breakfast Club introduced us to the actors that become the Brat Pack in the late 80&#8217;s, and the view on high school it had in 1985 isn&#8217;t too different even 20 years later.
