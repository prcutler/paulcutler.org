I continue to be impressed with [Spam Karma 2][1] for WordPress since I installed in a couple weeks ago.

I was getting about 50 spam comments a day in the blog, and Spam Karma 2 has cut that down to nothing. Zero. Zilch. I think I&#8217;ve had to moderate 3 comments so far it wasn&#8217;t sure of (which were spam), but that&#8217;s nothing compared to the daily maintenance hell I used to go through in deleting comments.

Kudos to the developers.
