[Gaming Groove][1] is reporting that their founder, Billy Wilson, has died at the age of 33. Details haven&#8217;t been released, but those who remember the gaming web news scene at it&#8217;s height in the late 90&#8217;s will all miss Billy.

Billy &#8220;Wicked&#8221; Wilson, founder of [Voodoo Extreme][2], as well as Gaming Groove, was known for his sense of humor he brought to the world of gaming news. At it&#8217;s height, Voodoo Extreme was one of the best web sites around to get information on 3d gaming, including games and hardware.

A while back I had [blogged about][3] Billy and how Voodoo Extreme had fallen, even before it&#8217;s purchase by IGN.com.

Rest in peace Billy.
