      <title>Bad Comcast, Bad</title>

      <description>It’s been rumored for a while that Comcast was filtering traffic on it’s network, specifically Bittorrent, and now the AP after significant testing, according to this story on MSNBC.com.
I’m extremely disappointed to have this confirmed. After Time Warner and Comcast swapped markets a year ago, I’m now a Comcast subscriber. Time Warner and it’s Roadrunner service was an excellent internet provider – a number of years ago when I was running a home server, I received an email from Time Warner.</description>

      <title>Derivative Works</title>

      <description>Big Media is nothing if not two-faced about the creation of derivative works. From the music industry busting re-mix artists – the same artists paid by the industry to promote their artists in dance clubs, to the film industry’s penchant for remakes. And how many movies made today are born from an original idea? Even this year’s Best Picture winner, The Departed, is a remake of a Hong Kong film.</description>

      <title>Digg Melts Down (and DRM continues to break)</title>

      <description>In what surely will be the most talked about story of the week (just above Dell shipping Ubuntu on PCs), Digg melted down last night. I watched it in real time last night as more and more users added stories displaying the banned HD-DVD encryption key.
It’s amazing how one 16 digital hexadecimal string of numbers (and a little bit of censorship) can wake up a community.
The blog at Franticindustries has the best recap of the story I’ve seen yet.</description>

      <title>Stop the RIAA – Join the Petition</title>

      <description>The EFF has started a petition to send to Congress regarding the RIAA’s tactics in stopping music piracy.
From the petition:
 We respect reasonable copyright law, but we strongly oppose copyright enforcement that comes at the expense of privacy, due process and fair application of the law.
We urge you, as our representatives in Congress, to stop this madness.
 As of this morning, the petition is at 80,758 signatures – with 100,000 signatures the EFF can send this to the Senate and House Commerce and Judiciary Commitees.</description>

      <title>Google DRM</title>

      <description>The Register asks the questions about Google’s new DRM that need to be asked.
Just because it’s Google, doesn’t mean they deserve a free pass. DRM is DRM. And now we have multiple, confusing, versions of DRM to muck up our content.
As the article says, so much for your motto, Do No Evil, Google.
If you still need to get up to speed on why DRM just plain won’t work, Read Cory Doctorow’s June 2004 speech on DRM to Microsoft or in pretty html here.</description>

      <title>American Edit: Dean Gray Tuesday</title>

      <description>The mashup artists, known collectively as Dean Gray, posted a mashup of Green Day’s American Idiot album in late November.
Within 10 days, Green Day’s label, Warner Music, sent Dean Gray a takedown notice. Today, Tues. Dec. 13th, is American Edit day, when websites all over the globe host the MP3’s for download. Not for commercial gain, but to share and enjoy Green Day’s music, dubbed with other music, to promote Green Day.</description>

      <title>Evil Corporations #3: Macrovision</title>

      <description>I haven’t done an Evil Corporations story in over two years, and it’s definitely time. The focus: Macrovision.
From their About Us page on their website:
 Macrovision helps solve the global need for content protection, DRM and software licensing solutions.
 Now we all know that I’m no fan of DRM or Digital Rights Management, and right there in their company description Macrovision makes it a point to let you knwo that’s exactly what they’re about.</description>

      <description>Try, try again.
Or at least that’s what the MPAA thinks. The Broadcast Flag is being revived by the MPAA and 20 member of the House have pledged their support to it.
Danny O’Brien of the EFF breaks it down for you.
This is a must-read if you care about digital television. The MPAA’s attempts to ramrod this through backdoor legislation is appalling.</description>

      <title>Stupid Local TV Broadcasters</title>

      <description>I missed 45 minutes of Destination: Lost Wednesday night because of a major storm that ripped through the Twin Cities. (It was no Category 3 or higher storm, but it did a little damage).
The local ABC affiliate, Channel 5 KSTP, used the hurricane system and people’s fears of those storms to sensationalize the storm reporting for as long as they could, including 45 minutes of Destination: Lost and the first 20 minutes of the season premiere of Lost.</description>
