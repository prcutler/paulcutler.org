Amazon made a splash this morning by announcing that they are now offering MP3s of albums you buy on CD &#8211; for free. But the even bigger surprise was that if you had purchased a CD from them going back to 1998(!), and it&#8217;s one of the 50,000 albums in their catalog that features AutoRip, they automatically added that album to your Amazon Cloud Player.

It was quite a pleasant surprise to wake up to find about 30 albums added to my Cloud Player, especially the Pearl Jam Twenty soundtrack, which features a number of different artists, which I could never seem to get ripped properly with the right artist names.

Amazon has [three videos up on the AutoRip page][2], including an overview, how to, and a video about Cloud Player.

I don&#8217;t know how much (or if) they&#8217;re paying the labels for this service, but I love it. I still like my shiny discs, especially from my core favorite artists, and this is a great service to provide (even if it a shrinking business). I buy most of new music on vinyl these days, and since I started collecting vinyl a few years, almost every vinyl album has come with an MP3 download card.

Now I can&#8217;t wait for the day I buy a book and can get the ebook&#8230;
