Why, oh why, can Internet Explorer not conform to web standards?

I threw up a placeholder on [Silwenae.com][1] using Drupal, and put a transparent PNG as the header graphic.

Looks awesome in Firefox, but IE you see the background.

I hate IE. I don&#8217;t want to use a GIF due to patent issues, and JPEGs can&#8217;t handle transparency.

Grr.

Silwenae.com 5.0 is up, and a history of it is coming soon.
