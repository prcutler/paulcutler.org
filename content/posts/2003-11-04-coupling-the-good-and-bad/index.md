So I missed the news last month, but the [BBC had a press release][1] on Oct 14th that Coupling is coming back for a 4th season. 

I never could make the transition from the (much better) BBC version to NBC&#8217;s version.

NBC&#8217;s version got the axe this week. Done. Caput. Over with. Oh well. The worst part about it is the perception problem that &#8220;Coupling&#8217; is bad &#8211; when the BBC version is absolutely hilarious.

Oh, and the Season 2 DVD just came out. Must get.
