I made it to about 12:30 last night, and then started to nod off. Was awake on and off until 2 am when I finally crawled into bed.

Turned on CNN this morning. Was happy to see Wisconsin went for Kerry and Feingold, but to say I&#8217;m disappointed in the end result nationally, is an understatement.

I&#8217;m shocked at the margin of winning, and how many Senate races went Republican. Shocked.
