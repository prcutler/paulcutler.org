I more than enjoy the Guitar Hero franchise, having got my PS2 out of the closet a year and a half ago after buying all the Guitar Hero games, including this last one on the 360 for the first time.

Tomorrow marks the release of Rock Band, and [Ars Technica takes a look][1] at it and approves.

I&#8217;m pretty excited to get it, even with the high price point, as a few of us have been known to get together and rock out to Guitar Hero. Now we just need to find a 4th&#8230; And I can play with Alex, who I am sure will get a kick out of banging the drums. I&#8217;m happy the Guitar Hero guitar works with Rock Band, but very disappointed the Rock Band guitar doesn&#8217;t work with Guitar Hero as I don&#8217;t want to buy another guitar, but really want to unlock the co-op songs in GHIII. Hopefully they will patch the 360 version so the Rock Band guitar will work with GHIII sometime in the future.

Thankfully, I have the room in my basement for the setup, although if I do pick it up, I won&#8217;t be able to play it until next week since we&#8217;re going home for the holiday.
