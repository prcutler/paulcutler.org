Ah, the 80&#8217;s. When I was young, impressionable, and naive.

[From the goodness that is BoingBoing][1], I bring you: [The Last Starfighter: The Musical][2], an off Broadway production.

[Jason Scott&#8217;s blog][3] has the review.

One of my favorite movies, I remember when Jason bought this a year or two back (at full price, no less) and we watched it. And then John mentioned a month or two back he had bought it too.

Must add to the wishlist.
