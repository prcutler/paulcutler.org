So I&#8217;m browsing the &#8216;net mindlessly this afternoon, and decide to take a peek at the [Star Tribune&#8217;s movie page][1] just to see if any new movies have come out I may be interested in. And what do I see halfway down the page but a story to the movie &#8220;Alone in the Dark&#8221; that came out this week, and this is what the synopsis said before you even click to read their review:

> If you took the 100 worst ideas ever conceived for a science-fiction film, rattled them around in a Lotto tumbler and spilled them out onto the screen at random, you could not produce a more asinine hodgepodge than this.

How many people do you think will even read that review, much less go to that movie? That cracks me up, tell it like it is Star-Trib!
