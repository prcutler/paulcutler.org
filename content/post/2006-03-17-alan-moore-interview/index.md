Mile High Comics has a two-part interview ([Part 1][1], Part 2) with Alan Moore, a giant in the comic book industry. The author of well-known works as League of Extraordinary Gentleman, From Hell, V for Vendetta and Watchmen, a Hugo award winner.</p> 

In the interview he talks about his anger for DC Comics for letting his books be turned into poor movies, not owning his own works, and the industry in general. Agree or disagree with his thoughts, you have to respect him as he stands for his convictions.</a>
