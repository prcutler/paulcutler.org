Oh, the new [Liz Phair songs][1] are yummy! Her new album comes out 6/24 and those songs rock.

Extraordinary is probably my favorite so far. The 2nd song listed, the one that will be the first release, sounds a little Avril-ish. But we all know Liz was around years before her, and Liz writes her own stuff.
