Today marks the one year anniversary of [89.3, The Current][1], a Minnesota Public Radio station.

By far the best radio station to hit the Twin Cities in a long time, The Current offers an eclectic playlist you&#8217;d be pressed to find anywhere else, other than KCRW or KEXP. With a focus on Minnesota local music, and DJ&#8217;s who get to play their own songs of their choosing, where else can you hear music from Elvis to Aimee Mann to Thunderbirds Are Now!

Check out their [real time playlist][2] &#8211; it&#8217;s as diverse as it comes. You can even [listen online][3] if you choose.

I&#8217;ve volunteered for a couple different things for 89.3, and the first event I went to was a volunteer meet & greet. Towards the end of the session, and their current Vice President at the time summed it up best. I don&#8217;t remember the exact quote, but it went something like this: &#8220;We want The Current to be the radio station that helps connect music for our listeners, so they hear the evolution of music through the years, from Muddy Waters to G. Love.&#8221; Not only do they play artists you don&#8217;t hear on mainstream radio, but they introduce new artists like the Hold Steady, and help connect the dots and teach you about music.

The Minneapolis Star-Tribune [ran an article this past Sunday][4] on the front page of the Lifestyle section about The Current. The article was only about 50% good &#8211; they took a number of shots at The Current in the back half of the article, but it gives you a good overview of the last year for 89.3.

Here&#8217;s to many more years listening to a great radio station!
