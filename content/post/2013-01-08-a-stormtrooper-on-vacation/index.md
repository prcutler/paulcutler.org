My youngest son turns 7 at the end of this week. After starting a new job in early 2012 that had a lot of travel, I &#8220;borrowed&#8221; one of his Lego Stormtrooper Minifigs who needed a vacation from the daily grind of the Empire. He travels around with me and I&#8217;ve [captured his adventures on his own Tumblr][2]. 

My wife tells me Jack giggles when he sees the updates, which makes it all worth it. Feel free to follow along.
