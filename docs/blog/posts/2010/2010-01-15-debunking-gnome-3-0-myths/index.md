Change is hard. People go through six predictable stages as they adjust to change, which I learned at a former company. [From Changecycle.com][1]:

> _People react, respond and adjust to change in a sequence of six predictable stages. The Change Cycle model identifies the thoughts, feelings and behaviors associated with each stage of change._ 

  1. Loss
  2. Doubt
  3. Discomfort
  4. Discovery
  5. Understanding
  6. Integration

With GNOME 3.0 coming out later this year, there is certain to be fear, uncertainty and doubt associated with the changes in GNOME&#8217;s user interface and applications.

[Diego had an awesome idea][2] that we should start a PR campaign and / or meme to start debunking this myths. It&#8217;s best to get out ahead of these things, and with that I give you: [Debunking GNOME 3.0 Myths][3].

Please consider this page just a stub at the moment, but if you have heard of any misconceptions around GNOME 3.0 or you&#8217;re a developer on a project and have an idea or myth to debunk, please add it! It will take all of us through the year to keep this page up to date and help our users and journalists informed of what the changes in the GNOME experience entail.

Thanks in advance!
