Yes, I know silwenae.com is down.

I received an email from my hosting company that silwenae.com executed a denial of service attack approaching 100 Mb/s this morning resulting in the hosting company shutting my site down.

This is the second time my site has been exploited in the last 60 days. I&#8217;m starting to lose my patience.

I&#8217;m waiting for the hosting company to respond, and hopefuly re-activate my site.
