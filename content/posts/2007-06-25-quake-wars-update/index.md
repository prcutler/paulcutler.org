I&#8217;m standing in Chicago last night (just after eating at a Chicago-style hot dog place, one of my favorite things to eat, but I digress) waiting for the train to take me to the airport when I get a call from a good friend informing me that Quake Wars [beta keys were available][1].

[Linux Games][2] has an [update from Timothee Besset][3] at iD regarding the Linux client and lack of beta:

> I don&#8217;t want to commit to any schedule for the ETQW Linux client at this point. Most of my time is spent working on the game itself, on the Linux dedicated server and on the network infrastructure.
> 
> Once those things wind down (in the upcoming weeks) I will start working specifically on the client. But fear not, ATI and NVidia have expressed interest in getting a Linux client early, so they can review how it performs and get their drivers adjusted. When we release, we&#8217;ll release a high quality product, just like we do on Windows.
> 
> In any case, don&#8217;t expect to find Linux binaries on the retail DVD. It&#8217;s hard enough for everyone to get gold masters done, there are enough things to check and worry about, I will not place additional strain on the procedure by trying to squeeze my additional set of files on there.

I have my key, looks like I&#8217;ll have play the beta at a buddies house for now. September can&#8217;t come fast enough for when I can play at home.
