Paul Cutler is a married father of three.  He currently works as a product management executive in the security
software industry.  When he's not attending his kids sports activities or introducing them to classic 80s movies,
he can be found listening to his vinyl record collection, watching football, or learning Python.  Paul is a former
gamer (known as Silwenae) and was formerly involved in open source software projects.  Paul is a fervent believer
in civil liberties and privacy and is a vocal supporter of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org).
He has been blogging about nothing for over 15 years, but most recently about learning to code with 
 [Python](https://www.python.org) and building an arcade cabinet.
