      <description>LCD Soundsystem played its last show last night at Madison Square Garden. James Murphy made being a DJ cool again in the last 10 years and brought a rock sound and beats to his electronic music that made it sound both familiar and new at the same time. I remember the first time I heard Daft Punk is Playing in My House from their first self-titled album – a lyric to this day, that if I hear it, is stuck in my head for days at a time.</description>

      <description>2010 has gone and now it’s time to share some of my favorite music of the year. Everyone has a top 10 list, so I thought I’d try something different. Well, that, and I can’t seem to whittle my list down to ten.
2010 was a great year for music. For the last few years music executives have been crying that the sky has falling as music sales decline. What they need to remember is that quality beats quantity – when they stop focusing on hit makers and on quality music and artists who will last, the sales will be there.</description>
