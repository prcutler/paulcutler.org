      <description>2010 has gone and now it’s time to share some of my favorite music of the year. Everyone has a top 10 list, so I thought I’d try something different. Well, that, and I can’t seem to whittle my list down to ten.
2010 was a great year for music. For the last few years music executives have been crying that the sky has falling as music sales decline. What they need to remember is that quality beats quantity – when they stop focusing on hit makers and on quality music and artists who will last, the sales will be there.</description>
