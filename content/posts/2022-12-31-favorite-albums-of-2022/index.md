I [shared this on Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@prcutler/109592254922689488), but in an effort to (maybe) blog more, here are some of my favorite albums of 2022.  I'm sure I'm forgetting some.  In no particular order:

Spoon - Lucifer on the Sofa
Metric - Formentera
Muna - Muna
Yeah Yeah Yeahs - Cool it Down
Frank Turner - FTHC
Taylor Swift - Midnights
Chastity Brown - Sing to the Walls
Hatchie - Giving the World Away

Spoon gets a special mention - the remix album, Lucifer on the Moon, is just as good as the original.
