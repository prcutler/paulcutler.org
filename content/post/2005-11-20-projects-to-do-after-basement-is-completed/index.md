Already looking past the present, things to do once the basement is done, and I consider building a HTPC part of doing the basement.

  1. Make a podcast
  2. Build a [MAME cabinet][1]
  3. Drywall the garage so Kelly has a work area
  4. Technorati Tags integration on this here blog
  5. Get Fuse running to manage all my computers / websites
  6. Hack my Buffalo TeraStation to use SSH so I can use the afore-mentioned Fuse 
  7. Catalog (online!) my cd, movie and book collections
  8. Fix my server (silwenae.net) (Probably should do this sooner&#8230;)
  9. Get paulcutler.org /.com / and .net integrated somehow
 10. Inventory all my stuff (and send updated list to insurance company)

I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve left a bunch of stuff off this list &#8211; I always have more ideas than motivation. And this doesn&#8217;t include adding the 3rd kid to the family, enjoying my new home theater setup and whatever else pops up.
