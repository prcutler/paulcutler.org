[USA Today&#8217;s Michael Hiestand&#8217;s][1] column covers the shifts in the TV network&#8217;s announcer lineups now that NBC has picked up Sunday Night Football.

Let me express my disappointment in the quality of announcers on the air in the #1 lineups. In no particular order:

  * John Madden: Too old, too much of a showboat, and has lost his touch with today&#8217;s game
  * Joe Theisman: Not many original thoughts, was in the booth to argue with Paul Maguire (who was a much better color analyst than Theisman). Too animated.
  * Al Michaels: All class
  * Troy Aikman: Has gotten a lot better these last couple of years. Getting Cris Collinsworth out of the booth with him with only help him. Insightful analysis.
  * Joe Buck: Stick to baseball please.
  * Cris Collinsworth: Good riddance from Fox and the booth. Won&#8217;t have to put up with you calling Packer games, or on Sunday Night Football. Thank god.
  * Michelle Tafoya & Suzy Kolber: I really enjoy both of their sideline reporting. Blows away Pam Oliver at Fox or anyone MNF had before Ms. Tafoya.
  * SNF / MNF losing Mike Patrick and Paul Maguire is a huge blow. I really, really enjoyed the way they called football games. Take out Maguire & Theisman baiting each other, and it was the best broadcast of football weekly, including the analysis and ESPN&#8217;s presentation.
