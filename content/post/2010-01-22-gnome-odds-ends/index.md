A few different things going on:

  * [Tomboy documentation is almost done][2] in Mallard. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed using the Mallard syntax &#8211; so much less complex than Docbook. Every time I have to look up an element reference, I shake my head and think, &#8220;_Duh! That makes so much more sense I should have figured that out!_&#8220;. [Nice work][3] Shaun.
  * I triaged some docs bugs in GNOME Bugzilla. Want to get involved with the GNOME Documentation team but don&#8217;t know where to start? [This wiki page has a list of projects][4] looking for help with their documentation.
  * We had a Marketing [team meeting earlier this month][5] and we&#8217;re [having another next month][6].
  * We&#8217;ll be having [Sysadmin Team][7] meeting soon too. (Surprise Sysadmin team members!)
  * We&#8217;re having a [Snowy meeting][8] tomorrow. I know it&#8217;s short notice, but I love the potential of Tomboy Online &#8211; if you can&#8217;t attend I&#8217;ve volunteered to post the log and meeting minutes. We need web designers, web developers, <del datetime="2010-01-23T03:45:44+00:00">CouchDB folks</del> (whoops!) &#8211; you name it there&#8217;s probably a role for you. Come get in on a project at the ground level! GNOME needs a web service likes this.
  * Rumor is we&#8217;ll have the beginnings of [Banshee][9] [documentation][10] showing up next week, stay tuned. (Though I have no idea where these rumors start, really!)
  * We&#8217;re in the final throes of pushing out a new [GNOME Journal][11]. Soon, I promise you, soon!
