      <description>40 years of using your imagination. Ethan Gilsdorf has a fantastic essay up on Boing Boing: At 40 Years Old, Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Still Matters. As the original Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons turns 40 this year, I’m guessing we’ll see many great tributes to the grandaddy of all role playing games, and Mr. Gilsdorf’s essay really resonated with me.
 Along the way, D&amp;amp;Ders like me learned about stuff. We discussed hit dice and saving throws, ballistas and halberds.</description>

      <description>Photo by fireflythegreatunder a CC-BY 2.0 licenseJust before Christmas, I visited my local gaming store with the intent of buying the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Basic Set to play with the kids over the holiday break. It was time to step up from RPGKids, which I started with the kids a year or two ago. I’m a terrible Dungeon Master and lack creativity, so one of the things I was excited about in buying a set was that I’d be able to buy modules to help create the adventures for the kids.</description>
