I vividly remember the day Rev105 changed formats. My wife and I were leaving work and climbed into the car in the carpool lot. Turning on the car, Van Halen was playing. I was surprised, but I’ve always been a Van Halen fan, and dug that they were playing it. Rev105 was the most eclectic radio station I’ve ever listened to, and while I was surprised to hear Van Halen, it wasn’t out of the norm from some of the things they played.</description>

      <description>Over thirty years later, Blade Runner still remains one of my favorite films (as I’ve previously blogged about). It was only six weeks ago that I sat down and watched it again – it is easily one of the movies I can watch over and over and still enjoy with a sense of wonder.
I’m not the only one who shares a passion for Blade Runner, as fans have paid tribute to the classic film in a few ways in 2013:</description>

      <title>The return of OMNI</title>

      <description>I vividly remember reading Omni Magazine growing up, both in my local library and my high school’s library. The mix of science writing and science fiction stories were fantastical and helped shape me for years to come. It was there I first encountered the writing of George R.R. Martin with his story Sandkings and other authors I would read as an adult.
Glenn Fleishman wrote recently at Boing Boing about who owns the copyrights of the former magazine:</description>

      <description>I’m a fan of the show How I Met Your Mother. Like most viewers though, I’m of th eopinion it’s time for the show to end. As much as I’ve enjoyed it over the years, I was disappointed when they decided to extend it one more year.
Apparently, Ted’s kids agree with me, from this video show at this years Comic-Con.
(Why CBS doesn’t allow it to be embedded is beyond me…)</description>

      <title>Audi’s latest commercial features a hilarious take on Old Spock vs. New Spock</title>

      <description>I have to hand it to Audi – this is the funniest commercial I’ve seen in some time, especially outside of the Super Bowl.
This commercial has it all – and the best part is some of the in-jokes for Star Trek fans. I don’t want to spoil it for you, so go spend 2 minutes of your life and watch it.

      <title>Henry Rollins – Spoken Word</title>
      <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2013/04/henry-rollins-spoken-word/</link>

      <description>I don’t remember how I was first introduced to Henry Rollins and his spoken word performances. I know it was a long, long time ago and when I first purchased the CD Box Set of his albums, it was over twenty years ago now. I wore those CDs out and they helped me drive cross-country at least once.
For a man who got his start in punk music singing for Black Flag, Henry may be the closest thing we have to a Renaissance man.</description>

      <title>Why You Can Never Get Good Seats at Concerts</title>

      <description>Have you tried to buy concert tickets lately? Once you get past the sticker shock of how much a ticket will cost you, especially with the fees, you can then enjoy the frustration of trying to find seats. Good seats. And you won’t find many.
Here’s six reasons why.
And that’s why I only go see shows at clubs.</description>

      <title>Can arcades make a comeback?</title>
      <link>https://paulcutler.org/blog/2013/02/can-arcades-make-a-comeback/</link>

      <description>Having been born in the early 70’s, I am a child of the 80’s. One of the best parts of being a child of the 80’s was living through the boom (and later bust) of the arcades. Whether it was going to Godfather’s Pizza and playing a handful of arcade games or Chuck E. Cheese with dozens of games or getting dropped off at an arcade in a mall while my parents went shopping, the fun in plugging quarters in for hours can never be re-lived.</description>

      <title>Alan Moore &amp; the Guy Fawkes Mask</title>

      <description>Alan Moore talk to The Guardian about V for Vendetta and the use of the Guy Fawkes mask he created for V for Vendetta and its use by Occupy.
 It is an irony noted with relish by critics of the protests – one also glumly acknowledged by many of the protesters – that the purchase of so many _Vendetta _masks has become a lucrative little side-earner for Time Warner, the media company that owns the rights to Moore’s creation.</description>
