For those of us who grew up in the 80s, Super Tecmo Bowl was the best football game ever made. There was nothing like taking Herschel Walker 90 yards, turn around, run back to your own end zone, turn around again and run 100 yards for the score. All without being tackled.

Someone took the electrifying Packer win from last Monday night against Denver, and did a mashup with Super Tecmo Bowl.
