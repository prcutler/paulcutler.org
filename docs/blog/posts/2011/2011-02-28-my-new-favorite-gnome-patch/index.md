For those of us without a disability, understanding the challenge users may experience when trying to use a computer can be a foreign concept.  (Or at least it is for me.)

Browsing Reddit, of all places, this weekend I came across this story of a user with [ALS][1] who created a patch for Eye of GNOME.  The patch contributor&#8217;s son added a [comment to the bug report][2] ([and a link to a picture][3]) that is a must read.  Go read it.  Now.

This is why we write free software.  All users can contribute.  And we write software that everyone can use.  Sometimes [when other stuff is going on][4] we might forget and this is a great example of why free software is important.
