The [EFF has started a petition][1] to send to Congress regarding the RIAA&#8217;s tactics in stopping music piracy.

From the petition:

> We respect reasonable copyright law, but we strongly oppose copyright enforcement that comes at the expense of privacy, due process and fair application of the law.
> 
> We urge you, as our representatives in Congress, to stop this madness. 

As of this morning, the petition is at 80,758 signatures &#8211; with 100,000 signatures the EFF can send this to the Senate and House Commerce and Judiciary Commitees.

I purchased 3 CD&#8217;s last night &#8211; I&#8217;m all for supporting the artists, but the music industry&#8217;s governing body is out of control when they&#8217;re blackmailing 12 year old girls and suing families who don&#8217;t even own a computer.

[Sign the petition today][1], the RIAA&#8217;s madness has to be stopped.
