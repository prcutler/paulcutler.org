<p>If you played Dungeons &amp; Dragons in the 80s, read the Dragonlance novels published by TSR or played Everquest, chances are you have seen artwork by Larry Elmore.</p>
<p>Just about a year ago Mr. Elmore <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1488741362/larry-elmore-art-the-complete-elmore-artbook">launched a Kickstarter to publish most of his painted art</a> from the last 40 years, and it was successfully funded on New Year’s Eve of 2012.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise yesterday when the US Postal Service rang my doorbell and delivered my Kickstarter package. The Postal Service delivering on a Sunday?! (My wife is guessing that our local Post Office is running behind this year and may be working overtime to deliver on Sundays to catch up).</p>
<p>The book is absolutely gorgeous. Almost coffee table sized, I was expecting just his artwork, but it’s thankfully not. Filled with stories, remembrances, backgrounds on some of the paintings, and more.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silwenae/11388514563/" title="The Complete Elmore Kickstarter by pcutler, on Flickr"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Also included were the stretch goals: a Black and White Sketchbook (pictured above) and a number of 8×10 reproductions of the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons box set and Dragonlance book covers (pictured below).</p>

<p>I’ve only had a chance to briefly flip through the book, but I’m looking forward to spending some quality time going through it in more detail. This was $49 well spent and in his last Kickstarter update, Mr. Elmore has hinted at a future Kickstarter featuring a matching hardback of his black and white art:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am planning other Kickstarter Campaigns later on, some special books, like a NEW color Snarfquest graphic novel, and we are working on card games and board games, which I am greatly involved in. One of the most important projects, that may go up on Kickstarter next year, will be a large hardback black and white book. I wanted to get all my black and white work in this book, but there was no way…the book would be TOO thick. So, I want to do another hardback of all my black and white art, pencils and inks. The black and white book will be a matching book to this hard back color book. If you have purchased this color book and you purchase the black and white book, you will have a matching set of hardback books that cover around 95% of my life’s work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll definitely be buying that one, too.</p>
