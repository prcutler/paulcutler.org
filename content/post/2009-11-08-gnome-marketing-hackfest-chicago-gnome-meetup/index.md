We are just days away from the [Marketing Hackfest][1] in Chicago, IL. Thanks to Novell and Google&#8217;s sponsorship, nine of us are converging in Google&#8217;s Chicago office for two days.

While we&#8217;re there, we&#8217;d like to invite any Chicago GNOME users and developers to join us for a drink or bite to eat Tuesday night at 6:30 p.m. at the [Rock Bottom Brewery][2] at One West Grand Ave.

I look forward to seeing you there!
