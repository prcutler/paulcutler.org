I'm attending my first PyCon today.  I'm pretty excited.  I know some argue whether virtual vs. physical is good, 
but as somebody new to the community, it's almost easier to come lurk.  But if I knew more people, there's no 
question that the hallway track in a physical conference is always fun.

Just a few of the talks I'm looking forward to:

* "Learning python during lockdown: a surprising bonding experience with my child"
* "More Fun With Hardware and CircuitPython - IoT, Wearables, and more!"
* "Diversity & Inclusion Workgroup Panel"
* "Introduction to Pydantic"

And more!  This will be a fun weekend.
