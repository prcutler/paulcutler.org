[The EFF is reporting that Congress may sneak in the Broadcast Flag into other legislation in the next 48 hours][1]. This is not trivial &#8211; HD content is available over the airwaves unmodified already today and the [Broadcast Flag][2] will stop that single-handedly &#8211; once it goes forward there will be no going back to using your media and your hardware the way you want to.

[Fill out the Action Alert now][3] and / or [contact your Senators][4].

Just say no to the [Broadcast Flag][2].
