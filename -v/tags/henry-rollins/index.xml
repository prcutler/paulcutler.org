      <description>I don’t remember how I was first introduced to Henry Rollins and his spoken word performances. I know it was a long, long time ago and when I first purchased the CD Box Set of his albums, it was over twenty years ago now. I wore those CDs out and they helped me drive cross-country at least once.
For a man who got his start in punk music singing for Black Flag, Henry may be the closest thing we have to a Renaissance man.</description>
