I was pleasantly suprised to see that [Banshee][1] is now supported by [Mugshot][2]. I&#8217;ve been running Feisty for the last few weeks, and haven&#8217;t found a Mugshot .deb yet, but on my second machine I was testing out Foresight (different story for later), which had an up to date package for Mugshot. I was playing music on my main PC, look over to my second PC with Mugshot, and it&#8217;s reporting what songs I&#8217;ve just played. What a pleasant suprise! Talking to [Aaron Bockover][3] in IRC, it wasn&#8217;t developed by Banshee, so I&#8217;m guessing the lads at Red Hat are grabbing it via Dbus in the latest version of Mugshot.

In other Banshee news, Snorp has created a [Banshee plugin for Avant Window Navigator][4]. The plugin replaces the Banshee logo in your dock with the cover art from the current CD you&#8217;re playing. Make sure you have a newer version of AWN from Subversion &#8211; my AWN build from a week or two wasn&#8217;t compatible as Banshee would just keep crashing on Feisty.
