The Foresight Newsletter has launched! This [first edition][1] brings you a report about what&#8217;s happening with Foresight Linux, including release news, security updates, tips and tricks, what&#8217;s in development, Foresight in the press, and highlights one package in detail.

You can also subscribe to the newsletter (and future editions!) in your favorite feed reader such as Google Reader or Bloglines by copying and pasting [this link][2].

Special thanks to Thilo, Kevin Harriss, Ant√≥nio Meireles and Ken Vandine for contributing and editing.
