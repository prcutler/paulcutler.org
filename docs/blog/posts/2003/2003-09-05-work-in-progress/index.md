I&#8217;m updating silwenae.net, I&#8217;ve come to a compromise with myself.

I&#8217;m going to keep the blog software, but not as the homepage.

The homepage is in the process of getting updated with IcculusNews. Which has no documentation. It&#8217;s a series of PHP pages that calls a Perl daemon. It&#8217;s fun hacking at it even if I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing.

Thank god Kelly had Perl last semester. <img src='https://i0.wp.com/www.silwenae.net/blogs/img/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif?w=700' alt='&#58;&#68;' class='middle' data-recalc-dims="1" />

I&#8217;m going to install IcculusFinger as well, and when I&#8217;ve got this all working, if anyone wants webspace / blog / finger ability, I&#8217;ll be more than happy to share.
