I received an email from Phil Dibowitz two days ago regarding his work on trying to get the [Harmony 880 remote working on Linux][1]. He had seen a [blog post from late last year][2] where I had added on to Aaron Bockover&#8217;s bounty to get Harmony support working.

Ironically enough after responding to his email, I went through my morning routine of checking the news on the &#8216;net while I ate breakfast, and saw the same [story on Digg][3] (linking here), and now a few hours later, [Phoronix has picked up the story][4] as well.

I would like to post one correction to the stories I&#8217;m seeing: this was originally [Aaron Bockover&#8217;s idea][5]. [Aaron][6] is a Linux developer and maintainer of [Banshee][7], everyone&#8217;s favorite music manager for the GNOME desktop.

I&#8217;m excited to see all the interest in getting Harmony remotes working on Linux, and take Phil&#8217;s advice: [give Logitech constructive feedback][8] that we want to see support on Linux.
