  I had mentioned some of the other Christmas presents I received this year, but this one is by far my favorite.

From my parents, an authentic Favre jersey, autographed and framed, with a pigskin matte in the frame. It&#8217;s huge, the picture doesn&#8217;t do it justice.

Now to get the basement finished so I can build my shrine to the Packers.
