[Will Farrington has created a wonderful plugin][1] that controls Banshee from within X-Chat-GNOME. And thanks to [Ken][2] for packaging it so quickly.

It looks and sounds so simple, but it&#8217;s fun to play with. I absolutely love Banshee (and am so excited about all the [Banshee news][3] [this week][4]), and I spen a lot of time in IRC. It&#8217;s like peanut butter and chocolate, they just go together.

If you&#8217;re running Foresight, just do the following:

sudo conary update xchat-gnome=@fl:1-devel banshee-xchat=@fl:1-devel

I&#8217;m running a normal version of Foresight Linux (not the development version), but installing X-Chat GNOME out of 1-Devel hasn&#8217;t led to any issues.
