After continuing to play with Jinzora, I discovered something: Displayed number behind Genre&#8217;s is not the number of songs &#8211; it&#8217;s the number of artists.

For whatever reason, I thought it was the number of songs, leading me to believe the import process was missing tracks, though it would show the correct number of tracks imported.

Well, der. Jinzora was right.

I now return you to your scheduled programming while I rip my CD collection for the 4th time.
