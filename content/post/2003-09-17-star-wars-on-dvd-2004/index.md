[The Digital Bits][1], one of the better DVD news sites on the web, [is reporting in their Rumor Mill][2] that the Star Wars Trilogy (Episodes IV &#8211; VI) will hit DVD for Christmas next year.

They report that Lucasfilm is so happy with the upcoming Indy box set, they want to do something quite similar (3 movies plus one extras disc).

According to the Digital Bits: &#8220;We&#8217;ve heard from a number of industry sources we trust (and who have proven their reliability in the past) in the last few weeks.&#8221;

And these are the re-released Special Edition forms of the movie &#8212; according to Lucasfilm, the originals don&#8217;t even exist anymore. Which, if true, is a shame, but I do understand Lucas&#8217; wish for a definitive vision of his movies. (Even if Greedo shoots first now). It&#8217;s too bad they haven&#8217;t been preserved for history&#8217;s sake.
