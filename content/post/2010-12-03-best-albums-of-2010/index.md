It&#8217;s that time of the year when various writers and magazines start publishing their &#8220;Best of&#8221; lists as the year draws to a close.

Whether it&#8217;s a top 10 list or a top 50 list doesn&#8217;t matter &#8211; what matters is we celebrate the the great music that came out in 2010.  I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised in perusing the lists how many of these albums I&#8217;ve purchased and enjoyed.  While I may disagree with some of the rankings, I generally agree with almost all of the lists I&#8217;ve seen so far.

Before we get to the lists though, I highly recommend [this article which explains how all of these lists are compiled][1].  If you read one top 10 list, you should read this first.

Some of my favorite looks at the best albums of 2010:

  * [NPR&#8217;s Top 50 albums of 2010][2]
  * [Largeheartedboy&#8217;s favorite 11 albums of 2010][3]
  * [Paste&#8217;s 50 Best Albums of 2010][4]

<span style="font-size: medium;">I&#8217;m still working on my list &#8211; it will be out in the next week or two.  And I&#8217;ll make sure not to try and fall into the traps in the article above!</span>
