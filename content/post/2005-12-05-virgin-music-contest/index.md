One of my World of Warcraft guildmates posted [an interesting link on our forums today][1].

Virgin appears to be launching their music service, [Virgin Digital][2] with a little [contest][3].

Find the 74 bands in [this picture][4].

It&#8217;s an interesting mental exercise. You can follow our progress [in the original forum thread][1].
