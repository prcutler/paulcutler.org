I&#8217;ve been meaning to blog this all weekend, but I got [distracted][1].

[MPR has re-launched their website][2], replacing just the blog, [including bios of the on-air talent][3], [a feedback form][4], [a FAQ][5], and [donation information][6].

Speaking of donating, in the age of XM, Sirius, and Napster, when you can pay $10-$15 month for hundreds of stations, why donate? Because 89.3 is public radio, a community service, and is unlike and other radio station out there. Where DJ&#8217;s control the playlists, not big media (yes, even XM has a significant Clear Channel stake), and 89.3 will also have a heavy local focus for Minnesota artists. I did my part, and put my money where my mouth is.

They will be streaming live, including Windows Media Player (more ick), and aacPlus, a fairly new MPEG-4 audio stream that supposedly has excellent quality at low bandwidth. [The open source VLC project][7] has a player available for Windows, Mac, and Linux that will stream aacPlus. I&#8217;ll be installing that this morning!.

Give it a try, and listen in.
