I saved my copy of Newsweek this week. Not for their apology for screwing up, but for [Anna Quindlen&#8217;s last page article &#8216;Life of the Closed Mind&#8217;.][1]

Under the cover of watching the class of 2001 graduate this year, Ms. Quindlen asks the question when did everything become black and white? Right vs. wrong? Red vs. blue? When did having a public dialogue about the issues die off?

And as Ms. Quindlen begins her closing paragraph, she sums it up well:

> So the young men and women who began their college years in the shadow of September 11 graduate in its shadow as well. The intolerant, the monomaniacal, the zealots driven by religious certainty engineered the worst attack on American soil, and the result has been intolerance, monomania and zealotry driven by religious certainty.
