[ESPN][1] has had a banner running for the last few weeks promoting the halftime shows of the BCS College Bowls for their musical acts. One of them has been [Queen + Paul Rodgers][2].

I am huge Queen fan, and really got into them again in 90/91 when they were re-releasing their albums on CD. I had almost completed my collection when Freddie Mercury died in 1991. I&#8217;ve had mixed feelings on this whole tour with Paul Rodgers not understanding why Queen would be touring again without their frontman, the legendary Freddie Mercury.

Who was this [Paul Rodgers][3] guy? Why was he touring with Queen, and why would Brian May and Co. resurrect Queen with a new lead singer?

Well, it turns out Paul Rodgers was the founder and lead singer for Free, Bad Company, and the Firm. He has an impressive [resume][3]. Now knowing his background, I can respect Queen&#8217;s decision to tour with him.

Browsing around [Queen&#8217;s website][4], I came across their store where they offer their [Official Bootlegs][5]. While the collection is still growing, the price is amazing for what you get. For about $9 after translating the currency, you can buy live bootleg albums with up to 30 songs. Encoded in 192k WMA (192k = good, WMA = bad), the price is phenomenal for what you get. I&#8217;ll definitely be picking up a few of those in the days to come.
