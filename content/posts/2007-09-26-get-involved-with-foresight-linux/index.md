Are you a Foresight Linux user, and want to give back and help out, but not sure how? Take it from someone who had the same concerns and doubts about how you can help out &#8211; I&#8217;ve been using Linux for years, and knew I wanted to give back, and after I switched to Foresight this past spring, I found a core group of developers who were open and friendly, and welcomed me with any help I wanted to offer.

With Foresight Linux 2.0 in development, now is a great time to get involved. We are having a Developer meeting in IRC next Wednesday, October 3rd at 1:00 p.m. EST.

We are looking for help in all kinds of areas, and talking about forming some teams to tackle some of the outstanding projects &#8211; including documentation writing, packaging, bug triaging, development and a website redesign.

Come and listen, and maybe something will be discussed that you think you&#8217;d be good at lending a hand with. More information on the [foresight-developer mailing list][1] and on the [new Developer Meeting wiki page][2].

See you there!
