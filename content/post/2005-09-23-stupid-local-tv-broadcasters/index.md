I missed 45 minutes of Destination: Lost Wednesday night because of a major storm that ripped through the Twin Cities. (It was no Category 3 or higher storm, but it did a little damage).

The local ABC affiliate, Channel 5 KSTP, used the hurricane system and people&#8217;s fears of those storms to sensationalize the storm reporting for as long as they could, including 45 minutes of Destination: Lost and the first 20 minutes of the season premiere of Lost.

I have it on my TiVo &#8211; it&#8217;s just them repeating themselves for an hour &#8211; high winds, look at the radar, blah blah blah.

But that gets me to my point: ABC is [unwilling to re-broadcast the premiere][1] this weekend, due to cast contracts and the residual payouts. At least they&#8217;re admitting it&#8217;s about the money, so they can screw over their viewers.

Being technologically aware, I just went out and [downloaded it][2] from an HDTV rip and burned it to DVD. 42 minutes long now and no commercials &#8211; just because my local affiliate wouldn&#8217;t broadcast it.

And the television industry considers this an illegal act. An over the air television show, currently stored on my TiVo, and I can&#8217;t go download a copy and watch it on my TV. I purchased Lost Season One on DVD a week and a half ago. I&#8217;ll spend money where it&#8217;s deserved, for a quality and innovative program like Lost.

But yet, god forbid you miss one show in a series, you are not supposed to download them. What if it&#8217;s a show like Lost, Alias or 24 where you miss one episode and it can seriously set you back in understanding the plot?

The TV industry needs to get with the times then and offer a technological solution if they want to make this illegal. They should be ashamed of themselves for being the Luddites they are. [Sony Betamax vs. Universal][3] was settled over 20 years ago and yet here is history repeating itself.
