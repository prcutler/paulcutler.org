      <title>Silver Saucer Update</title>

      <description>Now that I have the ability to pick a random record to play using the Discogs API, I’ve completed one of the two big features.
I’m now debating what to do next. I have a few options, all still focused on the random album feature. (I may have to cancel the “On This Day” future, but that’s a different discussion for a different time).
Learn CSS I need to learn CSS as the theme I’m using needs to be updated.</description>

      <title>Play Singles Part 2</title>

      <description>I was talking to my wife yesterday about my progress and she agreed that I should update my existing method used for albums to also work for singles - and that I shouldn’t just re-use that method and to avoid code duplication. It’s good to get confirmation that I’m on the right path.
But I’m stuck on how to do this.
If we look at the route to play a full album:</description>

      <title>Wiring Up Play Singles</title>

      <description>Earlier this year when I finished cataloging all my records in Discogs, I then put each one into a “folder”, a way for Discogs to separate different kinds of records. It’s setup by the user, so I created a folder for each type of music I have, and the number is the ID that Discogs assigned to each one:
all_folder = 0 lp_folder = 2162484 twelve_inch_folder = 2198941 ten_inch_folder = 2162486 seven_inch_folder = 2162483 cd_folder = 2162488 tape_folder = 2162487 digital_folder = 2198943 CD, Digital and Tape don’t currently have any items in them, but I hope to at least catalog my CD collection some day, but that’s a different story.</description>

      <title>Displaying the Album Information</title>
      <link>https://paulcutler.org/posts/2020/12/displaying-the-album-information/</link>

      <description>In my last blog post, I was able to pass the folder to Discogs to get a list of albums, and then pick one at random and give me information back about the album picked. That information was returned as a dictionary and now it is time to wire it up to the Chameleon template in Pyramid that will display the HTML.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of the JSON:

      <title>Iterating Through the Folder Dictionary</title>

      <description>After taking a break and coming back to it, I finally was able to iterate through the dictionary containing the folders I’ve sorted my records in to on Discogs.
Dictionaries are a basic object in Python, but my struggles show that to be good - at anything - takes practice. And I haven’t been practicing. Thank goodness for Stack Overflow!
I embedded all kinds of print statements trying to figure out how to play with the JSON from Discogs.</description>

      <title>Silver Saucer Random Play Progress</title>

      <description>I’ve made some good progress over the last few days on being able to pick an album at random out of a given folder and get information about it.
All of the work has focused on the back-end. Once I know I’m getting the right data out of Discogs, I’ll hook up the front-end to display it, but for now, this has been a little more complex than I expected. (It always is, isn’t it?</description>

      <title>Discogs Authentication</title>
      <link>https://paulcutler.org/posts/2020/12/discogs-authentication/</link>

      <description>I was ready this morning to write a new blog post chronicling all the problems I had yesterday trying to authenticate against the Discogs API. After finding the motivation to sit down and code for a few hours, I ended the day with almost nothing done. I could access the parts of my collection that were public, but the parts that required authentication I couldn’t figure out.
I sat down with my copy of coffee this morning, re-read the Discogs API authentication documentation, and voila!</description>

      <title>Stupid Pandemic</title>

      <description>The COVID-19 pandemic has changed a lot of things for a lot of people. One of the things it’s done to me is made it harder to focus on my coding projects. (Part of that is I’m very deadline driven, and well, no deadlines on personal projects…)
Looking back on this year, I’ve actually accomplished a lot, but just not on the coding side. I’m just getting back to it and I have two projects I’m going to make progress on.</description>

      <title>Introducing Silver Saucer</title>
      <link>https://paulcutler.org/posts/2020/07/introducing-silver-saucer/</link>

      <description>I’ve started my next Python project: Silver Saucer, which will be hosted at silversaucer.com. I originally bought the domain about ten years ago when I was thinking of going into business for myself, which never happened and I hung onto the domain name because I liked it. It was inspired by Neil Gaiman’s poem, The Day The Saucers Came, which I also have a framed art print of:
 The Day the Saucers Came   Once upon a time, I was also a big fan of The X-Files, so it seems fitting.</description>
