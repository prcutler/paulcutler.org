I&#8217;ve upgraded the ole blog to [WordPress 2.0][1] and the [K2 theme][2] to the latest, revision 151.

Overall, I&#8217;m pretty impressed.  Visually, it&#8217;s much better, though the post editor is now a more WYSIWYG type, and there seem to be some kinks to be worked out with that, but I&#8217;m guessing it may have to do with a Firefox extension I&#8217;m using.  The plugins I use (FlickrRSS, Ultimate Tag Warrior) seem to work, and I&#8217;ve switched from Spam Karma 2 to Akismet for spam blockage.

I have some minor tweaks to make including Ultimate Tag Warrior using an icon, some links, and getting my EFF link back, but overall, I&#8217;m quite impressed.
