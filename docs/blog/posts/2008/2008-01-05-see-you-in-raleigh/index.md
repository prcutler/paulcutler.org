The first Foresight Conference has been announced! [From the announcement email][1]:

> We are tentatively scheduling the conference for the last weekend in March, March 29th and 30th in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. (This is the weekend following the Easter holiday).
> 
> The conference will consist of scheduled sessions, a number of unscheduled / BoF (Birds of a Feather) talks similar to a Barcamp or unconference, planning for the future, as well as social time.
> 
> In addition to Foresight users and developers, we would like to cordially other Linux users who would like to attend, including upstream maintainers and users and developers of other distributions.
> 
> More details to come soon!

I&#8217;ll see you there, and if you&#8217;re coming, [add your name on the wiki][2]!
