If you&#8217;re not following <news.gnome.org> for GNOME project updates or the [new Sysadmin blog][1] (which is aggregated on news.gnome.org), you should be.

Personal blogs = [planet.gnome.org][2]
  
Project blogs = [news.gnome.org][3]

Olav set up the Sysadmin blog a few weeks ago and Christer is doing all kinds of crazy things &#8211; like [communicating weekly downtime schedules][4] on it. Crazy, I tell you!
