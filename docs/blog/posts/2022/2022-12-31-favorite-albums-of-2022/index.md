As 2022 comes to a close and I look back at the first year of The CircuitPython Show, I just wanted to say thank you.

Thanks to everyone who listened to the podcast, was a guest, or left a review.  The support I received was phenomenal - thank you!

After wrapping up season 2 a few weeks ago, the show will return in 2023.
