I&#8217;ve had a Mac Mini for the last week. I am ecstatic about getting it for a couple of reasons:

  * Mac OS X is the only operating system I don&#8217;t own.

  * Max OS X is based on Unix, and I&#8217;m a big Linux guy.

  * Finder&#8217;s new functionality in Tiger is supposed to be similar to [Beagle.][1]

  * PowerPC processor &#8211; again, only processor architecture I don&#8217;t own (Pentium 4, AMD, AMD64).

Ok, so I&#8217;m bragging a little bit, but I&#8217;ve wanted a Mac for a long time, and they&#8217;ve just been too darn expensive. Even the Mac Mini I customized on Apple.com when they came out for over a $1000 (this one was a gift, it&#8217;s the entry level one).

Initial thoughts: Mac OS X is as well done as everyone says. It&#8217;s polished, the bundle iLife applications are very good, and the OS is very intuitive. It has it&#8217;s quirks &#8211; I still haven&#8217;t found where to launch Dashboard and play with the desktop widgets. I&#8217;ve looked in the software folder, I&#8217;ve looked in the dock, and I&#8217;m stumped.

The form factor is awesome. This thing is about 20% smaller than I really expected it to be. It&#8217;s just so darn _cute_.

The bad: The entry level Mac Mini is way too damn slow. 256 megs in a modern day operating system just doesn&#8217;t cut it. It feels sluggish. And for a real kick in the teeth, the Apple store offered to upgrade it to 512 megs for $150 with free installation. $150 for 512 meg DDR 333 stick? I can go to the local Best Buy store and get a 512 stick for $30-$40 on ad and have the Geek Squad install it for $30. I didn&#8217;t even bother to ask Apple how much 1 gig is.

Overall, I&#8217;m pretty impressed. The tiny, tiny footprint of the machine combined with a well done operating system bodes well for Apple as they switch to Intel over the next two years. I still won&#8217;t switch from Linux though.
