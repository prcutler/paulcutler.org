I&#8217;m playing with the newest release of the Kubrick theme, [K2][1], which is in an early alpha.

It doesn&#8217;t work in Internet Explorer correctly on Windows XP (the right hand sidebar is off significantly), but I really don&#8217;t care anymore. I&#8217;m sick of tinkering with themes because IE doesn&#8217;t render CSS properly.

If you are still using IE (and why are you?) please switch to [Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox][2].

I&#8217;m going to leave the default colors up for now, maybe tinker with the sidebar, and when it&#8217;s final, I&#8217;ll apply a black style / CSS (maybe from the old theme by neuro).
