            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I received an email from Phil Dibowitz two days ago regarding his work on trying to get the <a href="http://www.phildev.net/phil/blog/index.php?title=writing_a_linux_driver_for_harmony_remot&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">Harmony 880 remote working on Linux</a>. He had seen a <a href="http://www.paulcutler.org/blog/?p=600">blog post from late last year</a> where I had added on to Aaron Bockover’s bounty to get Harmony support working.</p>
<p>Ironically enough after responding to his email, I went through my morning routine of checking the news on the ‘net while I ate breakfast, and saw the same <a href="http://www.digg.com/linux_unix/Logitech_gives_Linux_users_the_finger">story on Digg</a> (linking here), and now a few hours later, <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=NTg3Mw">Phoronix has picked up the story</a> as well.</p>
<p>I would like to post one correction to the stories I’m seeing: this was originally <a href="http://abock.org/2006/12/13/harmony-880-remote-on-linux/">Aaron Bockover’s idea</a>. <a href="http://abock.org">Aaron</a> is a Linux developer and maintainer of <a href="http://www.banshee-project.org">Banshee</a>, everyone’s favorite music manager for the GNOME desktop.</p>
<p>I’m excited to see all the interest in getting Harmony remotes working on Linux, and take Phil’s advice: <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/support_downloads/">give Logitech constructive feedback</a> that we want to see support on Linux.</p>
