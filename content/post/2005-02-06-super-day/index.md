The big enchilada. The game they all play for. The Super Bowl.

I love football &#8211; it&#8217;s the one sport I have a passion for. While I hate baseball, hockey is ok (if they ever play), like NBA basketball, really like NCAA basketball and would put NCAA football a step above that, it&#8217;s NFL football I make a point of seeing week in and week out.

NFL Europe, training camps, I&#8217;ll do whatever I can to get my fix during the offseason.

And today is the day that all that hard work culminates in one game for the players.

But what drives me nuts about the Super Bowl is some of the hype (not all, but some). 8 hours of pre-game &#8211; 8 hours? Really? And after Janet Jackson last year, this year&#8217;s focus on being &#8220;tame&#8221; &#8211; and it&#8217;s just ridiculous. So it&#8217;s okay to have an erectile disfunction ad, but yet Fox changes the name of the _Best Damn Sports Show_ to the _Best Darned Sportshow_? It&#8217;s ok for Mike Ditka to tell me about limp dicks but Fox yanks Mickey Rooney&#8217;s ass in a commercial spoof?

All ranting aside, here&#8217;s hoping to a close game like last year, some decent commercials, and good friends and food to watch the game with. (And go Pats!)
