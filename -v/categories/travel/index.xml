      <description>I just got back from a business trip where we took a customer down to Key West, Florida. I’m not much of an outdoorsman, but we had an event where we went deep sea fishing.
I caught a 45″ barracuda – the first mate said it was one of the biggest catches he’s seen in a few years. I also learned I really enjoy jet skiing. Fun trip!</description>

      <description>My youngest son turns 7 at the end of this week. After starting a new job in early 2012 that had a lot of travel, I “borrowed” one of his Lego Stormtrooper Minifigs who needed a vacation from the daily grind of the Empire. He travels around with me and I’ve captured his adventures on his own Tumblr.
My wife tells me Jack giggles when he sees the updates, which makes it all worth it.</description>
