As you should know by now, I&#8217;m a huge [Ubuntu Linux][1] fan. I&#8217;ve been using Linux off and on since 1997, starting with Red Hat, and have tried most distros in between (SUSE, Mandriva, Gentoo, Debian) but it was Ubuntu that made me switch permanently from Red Hat (and later, Fedora) when Ubuntu&#8217;s 4.10 was released.

I use Ubuntu on all three of my main machines now (except my Windows Media PC when I have to use Windows, and my Mac Mini, just to toy with Mac OS X), and made the switch to use Ubuntu full-time a year ago when I decided to give up my gaming habit.

As an Ubuntu user, I highly recommend the [Ubuntu Blog][2], written by a Ubuntu fan, Ubuntonista, who posts daily about how to make your Ubuntu experience better. I make sure to stop by every day.

If you are already an Ubuntu Blog reader, Ubuntonista [has posted on why he writes and calls for comments][3] on what his readers want to see there. Make sure you stop by, thank him, and share your thoughts.
