      <description>As I attempt to learn Python, I’m fascinated by how people are able to do this as well as how they started to learn to program.
I’m not the only one, as Ryan Gordon (aka Icculus), a well known game developer who ports many games to Linux and Mac, asked a similar question on Twitter last month.
This led to a lot of interesting tweets and Ryan created a Storify page to share them.</description>

      <description>* Dusts off the old blog *
This thing still on? Still working? I guess it is! I could give you the usual excuses why I haven’t blogged much in the last few years. The rise of Twitter, general laziness, etc. But I might be back to blogging for a little bit.
I won’t call it a New Year’s resolution as I started it at Thanksgiving, but 2016 is the year I’m going to learn how to code.</description>
