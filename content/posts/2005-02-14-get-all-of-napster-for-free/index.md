[So yesterday I&#8217;m talking about Napster][1], and what do I [see on BoingBoing today][2] but a link to a [how-to on burning all of Napster &#8211; for free][3].

There I go again being ahead of the curve. But seriously, sign up for the Napster 14 day trial, download Winamp 5 and a couple of plugins, configure them, and stream the albums on Napster. The plugins will take the stream, and convert it to wav, which you then burn. The only catches are that one, it works in real time, so you have to listen to the music, and two, you have to provide the CD-Rs.

[From the site:][3]

> Three computers, one fast networked drive, and a few dedicated people: Turning Napster&#8217;s 14 day free trial into 252 full 80 minute CDs of free music.

.

Have fun!
