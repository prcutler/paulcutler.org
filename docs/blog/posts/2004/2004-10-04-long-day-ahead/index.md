It&#8217;s going to be a long day today. I&#8217;ve already received a hard time about the Packers loss yesterday&#8230; I even subjected myself to KFAN this morning on the way in to hear them laugh long and hard at the Pack.

I&#8217;m not a big fan of Fox&#8217;s first team broadcasting group of Joe Buck, Troy Aikman, and Cris Collinsworth, but I thought they were absolutely right when they were saying that the Packers&#8217; offense is still searching for an identity. After running the ball and stuffing it down the Panthers throat in Week 1, they haven&#8217;t stuck with their gameplan week after week.

I was surprised this morning to see Pederson on the injury list on ESPN. I had thought, as did the announcers, that Nall had entered the game because he had the stronger arm for the hail mary at the end of the game. Here&#8217;s to hoping that Favre is back next week.
