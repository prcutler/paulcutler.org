Ya know, I post this morning about the cool things Yahoo is doing in connecting their users, and how I think Google is doing more around services, and web services than around user inter-connection.

And then Google goes and [acquires a company like Dodgeball][1] just to prove me wrong. Ok, they&#8217;re not out to prove me wrong, but Dodgeball is the definition of a service that connects users.

If you haven&#8217;t heard of Dodgeball (they were getting a ton of press late last year) you need to check the link above and follow it to it&#8217;s home page. It&#8217;s all about using text messaging via cell phones to connect with friends, and more imporantly, friends of _your_ friends to meet new people. Cool stuff.
