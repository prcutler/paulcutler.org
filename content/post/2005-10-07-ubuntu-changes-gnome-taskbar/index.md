This week&#8217;s updates to the upcoming Breezy Badger release contain an &#8220;uh-oh&#8221;. The Ubuntu team has changed some of the default [GNOME][1] artwork, specifically replacing the GNOME foot with an Ubuntu logo.

Old Ubuntu taskbar:

I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m very happy about it. Sure, it&#8217;s extremely minor. But one of the things I love about Ubuntu is how close they&#8217;ve stayed to GNOME. Re-branding bits of it I can see, but I struggle with this one. The taskbar, to me, feels like it should be off limits.
