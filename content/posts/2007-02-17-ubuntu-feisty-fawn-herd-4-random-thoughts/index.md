I took the plunge and installed Feisty Fawn Herd 4 on my main machine last night. Doing a dist-upgrade resulted in kernel panic when GRUB tried to load, so I threw in the Herd 4 CD, and did a clean install. (I know, I should be installing alpha software on my main machine, but it&#8217;s running so smooth so far&#8230;)

If you haven&#8217;t checked out Feisty Fawn yet, check out the wiki pages on Ubuntu.com for the different alpha releases ([Herd 2][1], [Herd 3][2], [Herd 4)][3].

It&#8217;s amazing to see how far Feisty has come just through the alpha releases.

Some random thoughts:

  * Codec installation is awesome. (See the Herd 4 link above). I tried playing a MP3 in movie player, it downloaded the MP3 codec, installed it, and it played. I then fired up Banshee, and Banshee played MP3 files just fine.
  * Looking at the Herd 4 page, the Migration Assistant has been included. I&#8217;ve been [following the Wiki page][4] for that since it went live. Though I don&#8217;t dual boot anymore, this is one of the projects I&#8217;m very excited about, as this will help in a big way to get users from Windows to Linux, and Ubuntu specifically. I may play around with my last Windows machine just to try this out. If you dual boot, please help test this.
  * My Sansa e260 MP3 player now shows up as a digital music player, and not a USB disk. Still can&#8217;t write to it in Banshee though.
  * Beryl works like a champ using their repositories.
  * Gnomebaker still wants root. I don&#8217;t know if this is because I&#8217;m using a SATA burner or not, but I [applied the fix I previously blogged][5] for Edgy. 
  * I got Avant Window Navigator working with some help, I&#8217;ll post the how-to after this.
  * Feisty fixed my microphone problems I [ranted about last night][6]. Not out of the box, but it was quick. I double clicked on Volume Control on my panel, clicked &#8220;Edit&#8221;, &#8220;Preferences&#8221;, &#8220;Capture&#8221;. Then went to the Recording tab in Volume control, moved the slider bar up, and bam, my mic works in Sound Recorder and Audacity. Thank goodness! 
Herd 4 seems stable so far, and I know the risk I&#8217;m running in potential breakage as the betas and release come up over the next few weeks. </ul>
