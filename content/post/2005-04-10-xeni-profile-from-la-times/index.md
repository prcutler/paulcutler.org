Courtesy of [Boing Boing.net][1], the LA Times has [written a profile of Xeni Jardin][2]. Xeni is famous as a co-author of the Boing Boing blog, tech writer for Playboy, Wired, and Popular Science, and radio correspondent for NPR&#8217;s Day to Day.

Xeni is pretty interesting. I&#8217;ve TiVo&#8217;d a few shows she&#8217;s been on as a guest, and listened to her on NPR, and her voice always strikes me as something I didn&#8217;t expect after seeing her picture. She&#8217;s one of the new breed of journalists who &#8220;gets it&#8221; &#8211; the convergence of media, pop culture and the internet are creating a new form of journalism.
