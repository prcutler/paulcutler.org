A few weeks ago I was out watching football with some buddies. I was talking about my new car and how I was disappointed it didn&#8217;t have [Radio Data System][1] built in, which shows you the song name and title when listening to the radio. &#8220;Who still listens to the radio?!&#8221; he said. I replied, &#8220;I listen to [The Current][2]! We have one of the best public radio stations in the country!&#8221; A week or so later, he forwarded me the Arbitron ratings locally to debunk my statement.

As The Current celebrates its ninth birthday, [City Pages has published an Oral History of The Current][3]. Featuring former and current employees of [Minnesota Public Radio][4] and [the station][2], they talk about the founding of the station; the highs of getting it off the ground; the lows of the rating crash a few years later and bringing in a consultant; and the success they&#8217;ve had with both the station, supporting new artists and especially their support of the [local music scene][5]. It&#8217;s a fantastic read and gives you a rare behind the scenes look at running a radio station.

And to my friend who wanted to argue with me about having one of the best radio stations in the country, the opening paragraphs back me up:

> This week, 89.3 the Current celebrates the start of its 10th year, having become the model for cutting-edge radio throughout the country. Not bad for a station built from the ground up in six weeks.
> 
> Before the Current hit the airwaves in January 2005, local FM radio was a dead zone, and 89.3 was home to string orchestras. Flash forward to today, and the Current has revitalized the local music scene and been named the country&#8217;s best non-commercial radio station by industry peers for four years running.

Happy 9th birthday, 89.3!
