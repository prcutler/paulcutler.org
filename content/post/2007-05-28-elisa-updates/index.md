Moosy, an OpenSUSE blog, has a [short post up today on Elisa][1], mentioning that the 0.3 release will be a complete rewrite, and now includes Tango icons.

I look forward to the upcoming release. As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, Foresight has the latest Elisa release already in it&#8217;s repos, so hopefully we can get an updated version when it&#8217;s released. I was this close (holds fingers apart) to trying to reinstall MythTV this morning on my HTPC, but I couldn&#8217;t find a surge protector as I&#8217;m out of outlets at my home theater. (That should tell me something, shouldn&#8217;t it?)

Moosy links to the following Youtube showing off the new icons:
