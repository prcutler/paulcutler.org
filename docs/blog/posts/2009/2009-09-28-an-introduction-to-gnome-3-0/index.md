(This is the first in a series of blogs posts about [Ohio Linux Fest][1])

I gave a talk this weekend at Ohio Linux Fest titled &#8220;An Introduction to GNOME 3.0&#8221;. The purpose of my talk was, which I hope to do a few more times this year, is to start introducing the community to the changes coming in GNOME 3.0. Change is hard, especially when we&#8217;re talking about a change to the user interface, and I believe the sooner we start engaging and educating the community, the more helpful it will be.

The presentation focuses on three things:

  1. What is GNOME
  2. History of GNOME (up to and including a brief overview of GNOME 2.28)
  3. GNOME 3.0

One thing I hope attendees take away is that GNOME 3.0 is more than just GNOME Shell. I believe the call to action in the GNOME 3.0 community that Vincent and the release team started back in April and that continued at GUADEC really motivated a number of teams to see what they could do to contribute to GNOME 3.0. In the presentation I talk about Accessibility, Documentation, Marketing, the GNOME Developer Platform, the GNOME Activity Journal and Zeitgeist, Tomboy Online and GNOME Shell (including a demo).

I spent a lot of time reading [Presentation Zen][2] these last few months and used the concepts the book advocates. In addition to the presentation, I also provided a handout (available as a [PDF on my website][3] as well) for attendees to take away that goes into a little more detail and cites and attributes all of my sources.

I&#8217;ve uploaded my [slides, images, and the handout][4] on the GNOME Marketing wiki, all available in one archive. This material is available under a [Creative Commons Share-alike 3.0][5] license. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve got a few things wrong here and there, and I look forward to any feedback anyone has.

I&#8217;ll be giving this talk in November in St. Paul, MN at the [Penguins Unbound LUG][6], and I&#8217;m hoping to reach out to a few more LUGs in the Midwest, as well as submit it as a talk at [SCALE][7] next February. If you&#8217;d like me to come give a talk somewhere, let me know via email or my blog.
