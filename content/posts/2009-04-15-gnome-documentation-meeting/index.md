There is a GNOME Documentation Team meeting this Sunday, at 17:00 UTC.

I <del datetime="2009-04-15T00:46:19+00:00">am a sucker</del> volunteered to help [Shaun McCance][1] facilitate the meeting. Here is the meeting announcement I just sent to the mailing list:

> Are you a seasoned and wily Docbook veteran? New to writing documentation and don&#8217;t know where to start? Now is a great time to join the team!
> 
> There is not a formal agenda, but we will start with Shaun giving a brief update on Project Mallard (http://live.gnome.org/ProjectMallard) and a question and answer session. I will do my best to help facilitate the Q&A, but there may be questions that we won&#8217;t be ableto answer and have to come back to at a later date.
> 
> I also recommend reading Shaun&#8217;s latest blog post with his personal goals for GNOME &#8211; <http://blogs.gnome.org/shaunm/2009/04/14/my-goals/>.
> 
> Lastly, if you have a blog or micro-blog, spread the word about the meeting and let&#8217;s see if we can&#8217;t get some new faces to come. We have lots of work to do as we work towards GNOME 3.0!
> 
> Thanks in advance to everyone who is coming, and for those who can&#8217;t make this time, I will keep notes and publish them. 

Hope to see you there!
