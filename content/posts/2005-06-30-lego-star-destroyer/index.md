I remember when the Lego [Star Destroyer][1] came out in Christmas of 2002. I begged my wife for one for Christmas. At $300, it was the biggest Lego set to ever be released at over 3000 pieces. I had a vision of assembling it and never taking it apart and setting it on a pedestal&#8230;somewhere.

Alas, I never did get one.

[Via Wonderland][2], an old blog post but a good one.

[This couple did get][3] a Lego Star Destroyer, and using their webcam at 5 second intervals, took over 4000 shots of them putting it together over 10 hours, including a dinner break. It&#8217;s a classic blog post from Jan. of &#8217;03. [Alice][4] is right, someone desperately needs to put that to music. At just over 4 minutes, it would be a perfect music video.

Medium and large versions of the video are available [here][3].
