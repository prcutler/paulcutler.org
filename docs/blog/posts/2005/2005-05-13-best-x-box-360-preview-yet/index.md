HardOCP has the [best X-Box 360 preview][1] I&#8217;ve seen yet.

While I&#8217;m not a fan of the color or the aesthetics, I am very intrigued by the new X-Box Live features, and the rumors of Media Center integration. HardOCP&#8217;s article also touches on the ability to plug in a portable MP3 player or digital camera and stream content right to your TV through your X-Box &#8211; pretty cool stuff.
