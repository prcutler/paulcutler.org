            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I sold a bunch of my old Sonos equipment and decided to splurge on the arcade. I had been looking
at <a href="https://www.gameongrafix.com/">GameOnGrafix</a> for artwork for the side panels and the marquee for the arcade cabinet.
I was undecided what I wanted to do as Kelly has a vinyl cutter, so it might be possible to make my own side panel art,
but I was going to need a marquee.</p>
<p>And then I found the <a href="https://pixelcade.org/">Pixelcade</a>, which is an LED marquee. Available in five different sizes, I
went with the P4, a 20&quot; x 5&quot; marquee made of 2 LED panels. It should work out of the box with LEDBlinky (on Windows) and
RetroPie on the Raspberry Pi.  (I&rsquo;m still undecided what OS I&rsquo;m going to run if I don&rsquo;t use the Raspberry Pi 3 B+.)</p>
<p>Depending on the game you&rsquo;re playing, the marquee will display the game art / title for that game. From their website,
here&rsquo;s a cabinet when playing Pac-Man:</p>
<p><img src="pacman.jpeg" alt="Pac-Man"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s just a small sample of the game art Pixelcade supports from their homepage:</p>
<p><img src="pixelcade-art.jpg" alt="Pixelcade Art"></p>
<p>Check out their homepage for videos of it in action and more artwork.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to add some complexity to mount this in the cabinet as I have zero woodworking skills, but they have some
nice mounting guides that should hopefully get me started.</p>
<p>The Pixelcade consists of the two LED panels, a power supply, and a logic board with a micro-SD card. It looks like
there is really <a href="https://pixelcade.org/howto/">good documentation</a> for installation of the hardware and software,
including videos. And if I get really ambitious, there&rsquo;s even a <a href="https://pixelcade.org/api/">REST API</a> for more
customization.</p>
<p>I still have a ton of work before I even get to the point of installing this, but if and when this cabinet is done, the
Pixelcade is going to be a killer feature.</p>
