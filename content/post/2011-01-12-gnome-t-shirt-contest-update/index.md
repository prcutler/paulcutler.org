The [GNOME T-Shirt Design Contest][2] was supposed to come to a close on January 15th.  Due to some technical issues with the submission form, we are extending the contest two weeks through the end of the month.  The contest will now close at 11:59 p.m. UTC on January 31st.

There were a few periods where the submission form was broken and your entry may not have been submitted.  If you would like to confirm we have received your entry, please email [Paul Cutler][3] to inquire.  We apologize for the inconvenience.
