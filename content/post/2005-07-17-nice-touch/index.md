I installed a [Netgear XE102][1] powerline to wireless adapter this morning to see if I could get my X-Box a better wireless signal.

Installation was a snap &#8211; I&#8217;m very imperssed how far powerline has come. Plug the powerline adapter into the wall, plug an ethernet cable into the same adapter in my den and into a switch. In my living room, I then plug in another adapter, and voila, instant wireless range extender. No setup, just works. And my X-Box went from poor to good signal quality (I&#8217;ll talk about my X-Box Media Center Extender experience in another post later).

Tied for the best experience with the installation, was the bright yellow business card I found in the Netgear box. With a big Netgear logo at the top, there is a paragraph of information underneath it that informs you that software used in building the product uses the [GNU General Public License][2] and the GNU Lesser General Public License. It also gives you a link to [download the sourcecode on Netgear.com][3]. (Ironic that a source code link directs you to an ASP page).

**Bravo Netgear!** Bravo for calling out that you use open source in a document external to the manual or just in a website like some of your [competitors][4].
