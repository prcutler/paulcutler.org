I [mentioned][1] a few weeks ago a link from Total Dick-Head, a blog dedicated to all things Philip K. Dick. [Today&#8217;s post][2] covers the new [Library of America release][3] of four of Dick&#8217;s most original novels that is released today in one hardcover edition. The novels are:

  * The Man in the High Castle
  * The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch
  * Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
  * Ubik

The Library of America&#8217;s mission is to _&#8220;preserve the nation&#8217;s cultural heritage by publishing America&#8217;s best and most significant writing in authoritative editions is as strong as ever.&#8221;
  
_ 

Their goal is to publish books to [last the test time][4]:

  * The paper is acid-free and meets the requirements for permanence set by the American National Standards Institute; it will not turn yellow or brittle. The books are bound with the grain of the paper to ensure that they open easily and lie flat without crinkling or buckling.
  * The binding boards are flexible yet strong and make the book light, easy to carry, trim in appearance, and a pleasure to hold.
  * The page layout has been designed for clarity as well as elegance. The typeface, Galliard, is exceptionally readable and easy on the eyes.
  * The binding cloth is durable woven rayon, dyed in the thread for richness of color. Handsome endsheets match the binding cloth and add to the visual unity of the series. The books are Smyth-sewn for permanence and flexibility, and each includes a ribbon marker.

Apparently the street date for the book is today. I actually picked this up almost 3 weeks ago in Milwaukee at a local book store. The book is gorgeous &#8211; it came shrink wrapped, and the paper quality and presentation is top notch. I own a lot of Dick&#8217;s short fiction, and look forward to reading some of his early novels.
