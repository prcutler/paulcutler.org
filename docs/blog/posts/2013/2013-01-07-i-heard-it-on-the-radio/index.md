I didn&#8217;t grow up in Minneapolis and missed out on the iconic radio station, WLOL. [Jon Hunt reminisces about what made radio, and WLOL, great][1] growing up for him as a kid.

I share Mr. Hunt&#8217;s enthusiasm for radio. I remember as a kid in the 80s having my boombox reading for the nightly top 10 with my finger poised over the record button so I could get a new song onto a mixtape. Later, in the 90s, living in Minneapolis, I re-discovered my love of radio listening to Rev105, which [I wrote about almost 10 years ago][2].

I [feel lucky][3] that we have [89.3 The Current][4], but Mr. Hunt as right &#8211; even they don&#8217;t take the chances radio took back in the day.
