[More goodness today via BoingBoing][1]:

A [diary entry on DailyKos by RadicalRuss][2] nails the hypocrisy of the Grokster case in comparing it to the gun industry.

**This is a must read**.

From the story:

> Got that? If a company makes a product that is inappropriately used to illegally copy a movie, that company is liable. If a company makes a product that is inappropriately used to illegally kill a human, that company is not liable. What&#8217;s the common logic holding these disparate concepts together? Massive corporate special interest money. Welcome to your government of the corporations, by the corporations, and for the corporations, where a pirated copy of &#8220;Hollywood Homicide&#8221;* is bigger threat than an actual Hollywood homicide.
