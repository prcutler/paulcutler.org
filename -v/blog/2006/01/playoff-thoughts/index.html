                <p>I’m not sure why, but I was happy to see the Steelers win this afternoon.</p>
<p>The Colts have a coach who is well respected, with a rep he can’t win the big one, but who is supposed to be one of the nicest coaches you’ll ever meet. They have one of the best, if not the best, quarterback in the league. And yet I was rooting against them.</p>
<p>There’s something about Bill Cowher that makes me cheer for the man. He’s a pull no punches, tell like it is coach. I like the trick plays. I like the blue collar feel to the Steelers. I like that Cowher just wins – and his tenure in the league is as impressive as anything.</p>
<p>Jerome Bettis is pure class as he has accepted his role, and Big Ben, while tip-toeing the line of cockiness, is a hell of a leader on the feel. Troy Palamalu just makes plays – and he was robbed today.</p>
<p>Robbed! I don’t know what it was, but I thought the refs in both of today’s games were just off. From the non-call false start / off-sides in the Colt / Steelers game to the overturn of Palamalu’s interception, there were even a couple calls in the Bears / Panthers games that just seemed wrong.</p>
<p>Poor refs can’t ever catch a break.</p>
<p>I was sad to see the Patriots lose, but happy to see the Bears and Redskins lose. (Yes, I’m more happy for teams to lose than teams to win). The Bears is an easy call – I’m a Packer fan, and the true rivalry is with the team in Chicago. For the Seahawks – meh. I’m happy for them as it’s been 21 years since their last playoff win, and I respect Coach Holmgren – even if he is coaching the wrong team.</p>
<p>Next week’s picks: Steelers and Panthers win, and meet in Super Bowl XL.</p>
