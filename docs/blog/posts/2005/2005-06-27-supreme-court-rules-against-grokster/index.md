The [verdict is in this morning][1] and the Supreme Court has ruled against Grokster in [MGM vs. Grokster][2].

Here&#8217;s a couple of key points from the article:

> The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that _companies that sell_ file-sharing software can be held liable for copyright infringement. 

(Emphasis mine) &#8211; Companies that market and sell P2P software for the sole purpose of infrigmenent is what the court is saying. Software such as bittorrent &#8211; which was developed to transfer large files such as movie trailers and linux distributions &#8211; wouldn&#8217;t be an issue. That, and bittorrent is free.

> &#8220;One who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright &#8230; is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties using the device, regardless of the device&#8217;s lawful uses,&#8221; Justice David Souter wrote in the ruling.

The Supreme Court has remanded the case back to the lower court that originally ruled for Grokster.

The good news is that 1984&#8217;s Betamax ruling is still law. Devices made, that could infringe, can still be made. What the court has said is don&#8217;t create a device and market to the fact that it&#8217;s only made to infringe copyright. The bad news is, that burden of proof is now on the manufacturer&#8217;s to prove that they didn&#8217;t create and/or market to the fact that a device can infringe.

It&#8217;s not over yet. I&#8217;ll update the post when the EFF gets their opinion up.
