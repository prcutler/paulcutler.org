I wasn&#8217;t there, but my family was well represented with my father and sister in Madison today as John Kerry was joined by Bruce Springsteen and 100,000 strong.

We are 5 days away and every vote counts. Pick up the phone, ask a friend to vote, it doesn&#8217;t matter for whom, but get folks to the polls. Here in Minnesota, same day voter registration is in effect, so get out the vote!
