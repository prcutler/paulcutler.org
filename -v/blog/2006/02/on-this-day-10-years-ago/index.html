<p>On February 8, 1996, Congress enacted the 1996 Telecom Act, which included the Communications Decency Act. After the President signed both laws, John Perry Barlow, at Davos, issued his â<a href="http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html">Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace</a>.â?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And Mr. Lessig is right. John Perry Barlow’s Declaration <em>is</em> still a good read. And, in my opinion, the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/telecom.html">1996 Telecom Act</a>completely failed what it was trying to accomplish. Ten years later, and we are seeing the re-forming of Ma Bell (Look at SBC – purchased two other regional phone companies in the last 5 years (Pacific Bell &amp; Ameritech) and last year’s purchase of what was left of AT&amp;T), these same phone companies complaining about web services like Google running over “thier pipes” and content providers should pay for the privilege (isn’t that why individual users pay a monthly fee for broadband?), and compared to the rest of the world, the U.S. has one of the worst broadband availability, and some of the highest prices.</p>
<p>It’s too bad too, because I belive the 1996 Telecom Act meant to do good things, and they just never happened.</p>
