Today is the day Ubuntu Breezy Badger is released and becomes [Ubuntu][1] 5.10!

Lots of good stuff built in to this release, some big, some small. ([Release Notes][2]). Bluetooth support, better partitioning, Edubuntu/OEM/Server versions (all new!), graphical boot and even editable GNOME menus.

[Download from a mirror today!][3]
