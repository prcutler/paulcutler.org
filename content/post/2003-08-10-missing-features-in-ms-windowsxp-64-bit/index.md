64 Bit WindowsXP seems to be missing some features [according to MS&#8217;s TechNet page][1]

Like what you ask?

Well, just to name some:

Windows Media Player
  
Digital video disc (DVD) video playback
  
The System Restore feature is not supported in Windows XP 64-Bit Edition.
  
Windows Messenger Service
  
File and Settings Transfer Wizard

If I were AMD, I&#8217;d be pissed.
