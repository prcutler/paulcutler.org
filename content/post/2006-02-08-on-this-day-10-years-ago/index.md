[Lawrence Lessig on today&#8217;s history lesson][1]:

> On February 8, 1996, Congress enacted the 1996 Telecom Act, which included the Communications Decency Act. After the President signed both laws, John Perry Barlow, at Davos, issued his â[Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace][2].â?
> 
> The Supreme Court struck the core of the CDA within 16 months. The Telecom Act is still being litigated, and Congress is now talking about trashing it.
> 
> But John Perryâs Declaration is still a great read. 

And Mr. Lessig is right. John Perry Barlow&#8217;s Declaration _is_ still a good read. And, in my opinion, the [1996 Telecom Act][3]completely failed what it was trying to accomplish. Ten years later, and we are seeing the re-forming of Ma Bell (Look at SBC &#8211; purchased two other regional phone companies in the last 5 years (Pacific Bell & Ameritech) and last year&#8217;s purchase of what was left of AT&T), these same phone companies complaining about web services like Google running over &#8220;thier pipes&#8221; and content providers should pay for the privilege (isn&#8217;t that why individual users pay a monthly fee for broadband?), and compared to the rest of the world, the U.S. has one of the worst broadband availability, and some of the highest prices.

It&#8217;s too bad too, because I belive the 1996 Telecom Act meant to do good things, and they just never happened.
