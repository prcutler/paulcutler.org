So I&#8217;m in Madison, WI with my wife last weekend spending some time together, and I tune to the radio to 92.1 WMAD, one of my all-time favorite alternative radio stations. And what do I find? Some light alternative called &#8220;The Mix&#8221;. So another one bites the dust. In the last couple of years they had gotten a bit harder, but still played awesome alternative with some Limp Bizkit, Staind, etc thrown in. Almost a cross of Drive105 and 93x here in the Twin Cities.

So I google for information about the format switch, turns out it took place Oct. 29th, 2002. Figures, right about when football season ended and I hadn&#8217;t been to Madison in a while.

So I found some articles talking about &#8220;it was just an evolution&#8221; for the format switch, and other lame excuses.

But then I came across the [Upper Midwest Broadcasting website.][1] This must be one of the most depressing websites ever.

It&#8217;s a site dedicated to radio and TV news in the Upper Midwest (Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota). It details format changes, anchors / DJs coming and going, and ownership changes. What makes it so depressing is seeing all the consolidation. I can&#8217;t even count the number of times I&#8217;ve seen Clear Channel discussed, and then ABC. Even smaller regionals consolidating to fight back. Whoever said less choice is good? And the number of DJ&#8217;s doing the voictracking thing &#8211; where they pre-record snippets of conversation from one city and are replayed as if &#8220;live&#8221; if another city or on multiple stations depresses me.

What&#8217;s interesting, and maybe a bit inspiring, is the number of low power stations that have been granted. Maybe there is hope yet.
  

  
Check out the [Dead Radio Stations Website][2] page. Rev105 guestbook, 93.7 The Edge, 93x, lots of old stations who have their old sites mirrored. Good stuff to keep alive!
