I live about 35 minutes from downtown Minneapolis, pretty far out in the suburbs, in a town of just under 20,000 people called Chaska.

As I&#8217;m driving back from dropping the dog off at the kennel (which is really far out there), I see a billboard just outside the Chaska limits for an upcoming GI Joe toy convention in downtown Minneapolis.

Now, I don&#8217;t know if they did any market research about who exactly lives in Chaska, or just couldn&#8217;t afford a real billboard closer to downtown, say on a busy highway, but I can&#8217;t believe that that billboard is going to be effective _at all_.

Just to give you an idea of how far out I live from Minneapolis:
