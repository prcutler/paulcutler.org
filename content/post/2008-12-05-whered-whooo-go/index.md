In the immortal words of Goose from [Top Gun][1]: _&#8220;Where&#8217;d whooooo go?&#8221;_

I took the last 6 weeks to disappear as I started a new job, working in my home office. I owe the Foresight community an apology, as I should have given some warning. (Though I did let Ken and Antonio know).

What started as a one week sabbatical from the internet between jobs stretched out, as I was traveling 3 of the 4 first four weeks of the new job, and working in a home office requires a high level of focus. Add to that meeting new people, figuring out what you&#8217;re doing and who does what, I needed to step back for a bit from Foresight. I shut down IRC and IM so I could minimize distractions while working at home. It seems to have helped &#8211; I think I&#8217;ve found a rhythm and schedule that&#8217;s working.

I&#8217;ve been popping back in to IRC this week, and browsing through the commits and JIRA issues trying to get back up to speed. It&#8217;s amazing how much is going on in just the short period I was away.

Again, I apologize for not having been around, but the good news is I&#8217;m working my way back, and looking forward to helping take Foresight to the next level.
