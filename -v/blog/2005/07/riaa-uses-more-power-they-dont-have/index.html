<p>The RIAA has ordered a take down notice to <a href="http://www.rpgfilms.net/">RPG Films</a>. RPG films is a machinima site that takes animation made from video game / video game engines to make short movies and films. Some of them included music video’s – which is where the RIAA had a problem.</p>
<p>How is this not fair use? There is no MP3 to download . Only the most sophisticated computer user could figure out how to seperate the audio from the video, and even then the quality would be awful – with a video file you’re trying to compress it down as far as you can to save your users’ bandwidth.</p>
<p>If anything, this probably helps promote more music you’ve never heard, that will spark you to find out who to make it and go buy it.</p>
<p>The RIAA just doesn’t get it.</p>
