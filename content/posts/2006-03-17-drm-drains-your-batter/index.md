More reasons why DRM is evil:

Cnet [recently conducted a test of MP3 players][1], and DRM encoded WMA files drained the battery faster than DRM-free MP3s.

> When it comes to the Creative Zen Vision:M&#8217;s 14-hour claim, CNET got about 16 hours of playback time with MP3s from a full charge, which was a nice surprise. However, when they tried playing WMA 10 DRM crippled subscription tracks on it, they only got just over 12 hours; a loss of almost 4 hours (~25%) of playback time due to the battery-hungry DRM. CNET found similar results with other players with WMA DRM drastically reducing battery life by up to around 20%. Apple&#8217;s FairPlay DRM seems to have less of an effect with battery life being reduced by around 8% when compared with MP3 playback.
