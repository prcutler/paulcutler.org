I was the 1716th person to sign up for [Save Betamax &#8211; National Call-In Day September 14][1].

If you haven&#8217;t heard, the new <a href=http://eff.org/news/archives/2004_09.php#001899">INDUCE Act</a> will try to limit copyrights even more strictly than they already are.

After the recent verdict by the 9th Court of Appeals in the MGM vs. Grokster case, this law&#8217;s intent is specifically to limit the court&#8217;s rulings in these types of matters. Not only will it try to limit copyright, but technology as well.

It&#8217;s time to fight back. I&#8217;m calling Congress Tuesday. You should too.
