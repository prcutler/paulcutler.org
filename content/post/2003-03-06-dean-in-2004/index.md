Any man that says &#8220;I&#8217;m going to put the Democrat back in the Democratic Party&#8221; might be my man. Though it took him a while to give credit to the late Senator Wellstone for the line.

He&#8217;s been getting a lot of press lately for being the anti-war candidate. I spent an hour Tuesday night researching him and his positions, and he stands for a lot more than that. His comments about gun control in particular were excellent, understanding that gun control varies by areas of the country. Other topics such as health care, foreign affairs, and especially fiscal responsibilities struck a nerve.

I&#8217;ll be keeping an eye on him, especially considering I&#8217;m not hot on many of the candidates, but that&#8217;s a different discussion for a different time.
