Just recently, I had mentioned Senator Feingold on the blog, and here is [more proof that he gets it.][1]

As Congress gets closer to extending the police state that is the Patriot Act, Senator Feingold says:

> &#8220;I will do everything I can, including a filibuster, to stop this Patriot Act conference report, which does not include adequate safeguards to protect our constitutional freedoms,&#8221; said Sen. Russ Feingold (news, bio, voting record), D-Wis., who was the only senator to vote against the original version of the Patriot Act.

Secret laws requiring identification for interstate travel, wiretaps without judicial review, secret reviews of what books you check out from a library or you buy, and other invasions of privacy are about to be extended for another four years.

Talk to your representatives in Congress, and let them know it&#8217;s wrong.
