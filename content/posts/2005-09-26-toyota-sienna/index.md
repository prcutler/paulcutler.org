  I officially feel old &#8211; we bought a 2005 Toyota Sienna minivan Saturday.
</p>

With the baby on the way, that will make 3, and 3 kids do not sit comfortably in a row in the back of my 2000 Ford Explorer, which we traded in.

We bought the XLE Sienna, which has a bunch of features, including heated leather seats, JBL sound system, power everything, and worst of all, some minor woodgrain in the center panel and on the inside front doors. Not too much thank god, but we bought the car sight unseen, as they were quickly running out of 2005s, and it was one of the few left in the state with the features we wanted. It&#8217;s nice enough, and drives nice. 

But I miss my explorer, and now have to drive my wife&#8217;s 2001 Ford Escape while she drives the minivan. She&#8217;s about as excited to drive the Sienna as I am the Escape.
