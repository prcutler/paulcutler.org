Google [has launched][1] Google Talk a day early. Turns out Google is running one big [Jabber][2] server. Get yourself [an IM client that is Jabber compatible][3] such as [Gaim][4] and do this:

1. Open a client supporting Jabber (AdiumX, Gaim, etc.)
     
2. Your server name is talk.google.com
     
3. Your username is the same as your Google ID. Example: user@gmail.com
     
4. Your password is the same as you use to login to Gmail or other Google login locations.

_Update: And now the [talk.google.com][5] website is up offering a Windows Jabber client for download, as well as Jabber-compatible instructions for Mac & Linux users._
