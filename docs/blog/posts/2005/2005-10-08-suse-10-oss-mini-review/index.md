[Seb Payne reviews SUSE 10 OSS][1] so you don&#8217;t have to. More of a mini-review, really, but it hits the good points.

YAST support is so-so and GNOME feels unfinished. One of the things that has driven me nuts about SUSE in the past is it&#8217;s KDE icons in GNOME &#8211; which it still retains.

Seb Payne is a Hula developer, and has been bouncing back from Ubuntu to SUSE and back again. Like Seb, I&#8217;m sticking with Ubuntu.
