      <description>We are only 49 days away from Record Store Day 2013, to be held on April 19th.
Support your local record store and get some cool, limited edition releases. The official records to be released isn’t out yet, but some sites are up with the leaked lists. Other than the Mad Season re-release, I haven’t seen a lot that I’m personally interested, but there are enough records coming out to make everyone happy.</description>
