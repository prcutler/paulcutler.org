[GNOME Journal][1], the online magazine dedicated to everything surrounding the [GNOME Desktop][2], needs your help!

We haven&#8217;t published an edition of the GNOME Journal since December 2007, and work is ramping up to get a new edition published.

What kind of help do we need? I&#8217;m glad you asked! It might not be what you think. We need:

  * CSS / HTML hackers &#8211; We are migrating GNOME Journal from it&#8217;s current CMS to WordPress, and we have some final touches that need to be fixed on our WordPress theme, as well as the look and feel of the archives section.
  * Editors! We have the content, it just needs to be proofed.
  * Writers &#8211; We have the content for this edition, but we know how long it can take to write an article, and we want to get back to publishing on a more regular basis.

To sum it up &#8211; if you want to help, we probably have a job for you. We are having a meeting Thursday night (tomorrow!) in GimpNet IRC in #gnomejournal at 22:00 p.m. EDT. More information at the links below.

Want to learn more? Here are some links:

  * [GNOME Journal Wiki page][3] on live.gnome.org
  * Want to write an article for GNOME Journal? [Here are some article ideas][4] on the wiki.
  * Here is our [meeting agenda for Thursday nights meeting and sign-up page][5] if you can come. 
  * Join the GNOME Journal [mailing list][6] and [read this month&#8217;s archives][7] to see what we&#8217;re up to.
  * Here is the [mailing list post that summarizes][8] our infrastructure to-do list for CSS / HTML / WordPress hackers.

Now is a great time to join the GNOME Journal team as we&#8217;re just getting active again. All help is welcome &#8211; hackers, writers, editors. Join now!
