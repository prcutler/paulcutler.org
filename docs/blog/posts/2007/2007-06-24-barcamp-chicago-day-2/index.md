We&#8217;re back at Barcamp as of just after noon after 4 hours of sleep. We&#8217;re surprisingly awake and ready to go. We had a small hicuup trying to download the images needed for today&#8217;s Conary talk, but SpecialKevin bailed us out.

Ken is on in 10 minutes &#8211; the first talk is on Conary, and he will be demonstrating a MythTV appliance. (I&#8217;m so excited &#8211; I&#8217;m on vacation as of Thursday, and one of my projects over vacation is to get my MythTV box up and running finally. The timing of this talk couldn&#8217;t be better!)

Ken then continues on for another hour at 2:00 CST with the Foresight presentation. The day&#8217;s a little in flux, so we might push it back as people are still trickling in (we were up late&#8230;.). And then at 3, the first US based GNOME usergroup meeting, a brainstorming session with SpecialKevin.

More to come soon!
