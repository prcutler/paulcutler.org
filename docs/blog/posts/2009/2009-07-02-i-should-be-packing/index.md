Tomorrow night at this time, thanks to the generosity of the GNOME Foundation which is sponsoring my travel, I will be on a flight (hopefully asleep) crossing the Atlantic. I&#8217;m heading to Europe for the first time to attend the [Gran Canaria Desktop Summit][1]. (My wife is fairly annoyed my first trip to Europe does not include her, but that&#8217;s another story).

A few of us from the GNOME Journal team will be there &#8211; if you have an idea for an article, interview, or a cool app to show off, please look me up. I&#8217;m very excited to meet face to face, and very thankful for the opportunity.

And now I need to go finish packing for my flight tomorrow afternoon.
