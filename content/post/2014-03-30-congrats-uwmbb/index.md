Congratulations to the University of Wisconsin&#8217;s Men&#8217;s Basketball team on their victory over Arizona to win the West Regional bracket and advance to the Final Four.

[Tom Oates of the Wisconsin State Journal has an excellent article][1] on what this means for Coach Bo Ryan.

The game was a nail biter, with the last 18 minutes of regulation being a one possession game before finally going into overtime and the Badgers pulling out a huge win. On to North Texas and a chance to play in the national championship.
