Thanks to gout to [FreeCulture.org&#8217;s RIAA-free CDs Holiday Gift Guide][1]. FreeCulture.Org has put together a list of bands whose labels are **not** members of the RIAA. (You know &#8211; the group that sues 13 year old kids for things they didn&#8217;t do, and when they can&#8217;t pay up, blackmails them).

Suprisingly, there&#8217;s some really good bands on the lists. A few notable selections:

  * [Dan&#8217;s List][2]: Interpol, New Pornagraphers, The Go! Team, Modest Mouse
  * [Gavin&#8217;s List][3]: Pavement, The Shins, Sleater-Kinney
  * [Jordan&#8217;s List][4] (Mainstream 90&#8217;s Bands with new non-RIAA labels): Dishwalla, Collective Soul, K&#8217;s Choice. And suprisingly, Hootie & The Blowfish. (Sure, chuckle, but maybe they get it now). Probably the best list out of the bunch.

And plenty more I didn&#8217;t name. And check out their [blog post][5] making and submitting your own RIAA-free CD Holiday Gift Guide.

So if you&#8217;re in the mood for some new music this year, check out one of the above artists &#8211; they get that it&#8217;s about the music, and the artists &#8211; not one of the Big 4 labels and supporting big media&#8217;s pockets.
