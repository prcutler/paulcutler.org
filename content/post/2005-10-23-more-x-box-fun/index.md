Playing around with the hacked X-Box, I figured out how to edit the XML configuration file to have My Music & My Movies on the XBMC point directly to my Buffalo Terrastation that houses all my movies and music &#8211; no more network browsing to get there, nice and easy.

Then I did something which I haven&#8217;t done in forever, which was hop on IRC. Got the link to download some emulators, and threw up MameOX and a Sega Genesis emulator. Threw some roms on the X-Box, and I was playing Elevator Action. I had upped Vanguard as well &#8211; I don&#8217;t think my wife is happy with me now as that was one of her favorite games growing up and she knows it&#8217;s there just to distract her. ðŸ™‚
