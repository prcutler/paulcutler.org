Bob Mould recently [did an interview][1] on [89.3 The Current][2]and after listening to the interview on-line (I only caught part of it in the car) he mentioned he had a new album coming out.

Sure enough, Googling for Bob Mould turns up [his weblog][3] with a big link to [pre-order his new CD][4]. The album [comes out July 26][5] unless you pre-orded from Yep Rock Records in time, which I did. It shipped last Tuesday, and I received it yesterday.

The album is great. Vintage Bob Mould, he returns to his 90&#8217;s sound with guitar driven sound, and hints of his recent foray into electronica with his last album Modulate. A good example of where the guitar + minor bits of electronica is _(Shine Your) Light Love Hope_, which mixes both sounds very well, as does _I am Vision I am Sound_. The next track on the album, _Paralyzed_ is a great example of the power guitar that made Sugar and Bob Mould&#8217;s albums so well done. _Best Thing_, _Underneath Days_ and _Missing You_ are a fewyou have to check out for the signature Bob Mould guitar sound.

A few ballads are even thrown in to mix it up &#8211; _High Fidelity_ slows it down, while _Gauze of Friendship_ is well done on the acoustic guitar.

I purchased the 2 disc special edition, and am happy and sad at the same time. Happy that I got the 2nd (bonus) 9 track CD, with 2 remixes of _(Shine Your) Light Love Hope_ and a remix of _Paralyzed_. The 2 disc set comes in a box, with extra artwork and the second disc (photo below).

I&#8217;m disappointed in that both discs are enclosed in a paper case, rather than a nicer jewel case. The artwork, while well done, as loose sheets that are jewel case sized, will probably never see the light of day outside the special edition box. I would have preferred a slightly larger box with both discs in a hard jewel case, which would make using in the car and treating right much easier.

The price for the pre-order was right &#8211; at first I thought $25 + $4 shipping was a bit high, but looking at Amazon&#8217;s pre-order price with a $29 retail and everyday price of $26 I actually got a deal. The music is vintage Bob Mould, well done, and well worth the money spent.
