I&#8217;m kind of frustrated with b2evolution (the software package running this blog).

In the .8 release, they added the functionality to do multiple blogs on one site. This broke my site fairly badly, and the documentation is lacking &#8211; but I don&#8217;t have a problem with that. This is beta software on top of a base package someone else created.

I did post a help post on their forums and got zero responses, even after searching before I posted.

.83 beta was just released, so I&#8217;ll try that. But if it doesn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;m seriously considering a very basic site running IcculusNews and IcculusFinger from [Icculus.org][1].

Just don&#8217;t know if port 263 is open&#8230; otherwise I meet all the requirements, and having a web page that looks and feels like the old web appeals to me&#8230;
