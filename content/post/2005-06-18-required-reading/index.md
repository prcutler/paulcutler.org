My new favorite magazine and website is brought to you by the geniuses behind [Make Magazine][1].

From their website:

> The first magazine devoted to digital projects, hardware hacks, and D.I.Y. inspiration.

It&#8217;s like Popular Science was, except for the 21st century.

The [MAKE Blog][2] is fantastic, updated often with lots of DIY tricks and links.

I even downloaded two of their [Podcasts][3] last week, and those were pretty good too.

The magazine is fantastic &#8211; it&#8217;s a quarterly, nice and thick, with information on what others are out there hacking on, one project with detailed step by steps per month, and tons of cool other articles.

[O&#8217;Reilly][4] has done it again.
