For the last few weeks, Neil Gaiman has tweeted links to a cryptic new website that asked you to RSVP (via email) to a website, [Who Haunts Neil][1]. Yesterday, if you had sent an RSVP, you received an email with an update to this very mysterious site, with Mr. Gaiman hosting a video introducing his latest project: _Wayward Manor_.

Neil, in partnership with game studio The Odd Gentlemen, is launching his first game. _Wayward Manor_ will be a puzzle / adventure hybrid and is doing a Kickstarter-like funding campaign, where you can [pre-order the game][2] at a number of different payment tiers with different rewards. It will be released first on PC & Mac, and a tablet version is planned.

If you know anything of Neil Gaiman, he has a love and personal passion in the macabre &#8211; a word he even uses to describe the game. He&#8217;s previously talked about how he loves [Charles Addams][3] and this seems to fit right in to that kind of genre.

I had the opportunity to see Neil a few weeks ago in Bloomington, MN on his book tour for The Ocean at the End of the Lane and he remains one of my favorite authors. I&#8217;m excited to see his first foray into video games.

Watch the video below hosted by Neil and his adorable English accent introducing _Wayward Manor_.
