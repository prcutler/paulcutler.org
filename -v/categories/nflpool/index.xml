      <description>tl;dr: I don’t get testing, but thanks to Talk Python I’m starting to put it together. If you’ve taken both the Python for Entrepreneurs course and the Building Data Driven Web Apps with Pyramid this might help you write tests using the Python for Entrepreneurs code. And if you’ve taken courses at Talk Python, take advantage of the office hours!
I don’t get testing in Python at all. I don’t have a computer science degree and Python is a hobby for me.</description>

      <description>Alternative title: There is No Offseason (or writing my Python apps never ends and that&amp;rsquo;s ok) The blogging might slow down some, but the coding never stops. Ok, well maybe a little. After creating and launching MLBPool2 this past spring, I took a small break and then back at it for the upcoming season of NFLPool.
I have two big goals for NFLPool before the 2018 season starts:
 Fix the time / timezone issue where a player tried to submit his picks before the first game of the season started to, but was denied.</description>
