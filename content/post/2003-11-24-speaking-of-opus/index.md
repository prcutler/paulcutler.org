I liked the comic this morning. I thought it was a really good way to re-introduce the old penguin.

I submitted the MSNBC interview link to Slashdot on Friday about Opus, but they didn&#8217;t take mine, and posted someone elses yesterday. And it was my first ever submission too! At least I had mod points at the time.
