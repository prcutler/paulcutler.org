I watched the Lost finale last night, including last weeks and this week&#8217;s 2 hour finale.

The finale was well done, I especially liked the multiple flashbacks for each character. Hurley continues to crack me up, and the show did a very good job tying the characters and stories together.

[This website looks to continue the finale][1], and starts more questions than there are answers.
