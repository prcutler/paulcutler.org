There is a small chance my website might temporarily go offline for the next week or two. I&#8217;ve been working with [Site5][1] to transfer servers and downgrade my services, but communication has been spotty. Unfortunately, my account is technically up this week, and as luck would have it, I will be traveling when that occurs.

If that happens, and my account isn&#8217;t extended, I won&#8217;t be able to deal with it as I&#8217;m traveling for work later in the work. And then I will be very unhappy.

Cross your fingers!
