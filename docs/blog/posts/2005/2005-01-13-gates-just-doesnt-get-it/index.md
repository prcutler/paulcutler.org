[Gizmodo][1] has their interview with Bill
  
Gates Part Four: Communists and DRM up.

Bill Gates, Microsoft&#8217;s chariman has been getting flak for some comments at CES where he equates those who don&#8217;t favor copyright and DRM as communists. He more than proves that it&#8217;s Gates himself that doesn&#8217;t get it in the above interview.

Look Bill: No one questions that artists should be compensated for their work. Period. The fact that some of us may choose to create content, say, a blog, and not want to be compensated, and want to share it, is our choice. And when we do choose that, we can choose to use the [Creative Commons licenses][2] to share our work.

God forbid a music artist, or the spoken word, or the written word want to be given away at the artists&#8217; discretion. It&#8217;s worked in the programming world, and more and more examples in the media world have started.

Viva la revolution.
