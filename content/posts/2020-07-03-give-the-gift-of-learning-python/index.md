Humble Bundle is back with a Python focused bundle:  Learn Python Programming with PyCharm.  Featuring $1400 worth of books, online training, exercises and more.  I've benefited from from the Python Humble Bundles in the past as well training videos and books in this bundle.  I've previously written about my love of the Talk Python training videos and three are included here, too.  (Disclosure:  I once received a training free from Talk Python in exchange for a review.)

This gave me the idea that I want to donate one of these bundles to an organization that can pass it on to someone who wants to learn programming and Python:

Michael Kennedy referred me to the [Hidden Genius Project](https://www.hiddengeniusproject.org/).  I've reached out to them and I'm waiting to hear back.  I asked them two questions:
* Can they take the giftable link from Humble Bundle and get it to someone who will use it?
* Can they also take individual parts of the Humble Bundle?  For example, I have a paid PyCharm license already - can they take the 6 month license I received in the bundle I bought for myself and pass that on to someone?

I also [posted about this on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/hkl4mx/idea_give_the_gift_of_learning_python_with_the/).  If you know of a deserving organization that can take and use any part of the Humble Bundle, add a comment there or [email me](https://paulcutler.org) or [message me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/prcutler).  I'll figure out a way to keep the list published.

If Python has been good to you and if you have the means (I know there is pandemic going on and a lot of people are in different financial situations) think about buying a Humble Bundle for $25 and giving it as a gift.  Once we've got some organizations identified, I will match the first $100 in donations to the same groups.
