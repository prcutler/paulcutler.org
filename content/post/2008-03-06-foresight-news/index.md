Here are just a few things going on in the world of Foresight recently:

  * [Tasky][1] is [packaged for FL:2][2]. Get control of your to-do lists on your desktop, works with [RTM][3]. Cool, new app in development.
  * The new [Foresight website][4] was released 3 days ago! Still a few bug fixes to go. And we&#8217;re looking for help on translations.
  * A forum [was picked][5] for Foresight: [SMF][6]. Hopefully will deploy this month. 
  * [Shuttle][7] chooses Foresight for it&#8217;s new [KPC][8]. More coverage [here][9], [here][10], and [here][11]. [Digg it][12]!
  * [Beta 1][13] of Foresight 2.0 was released this morning! First time we&#8217;ve released installable CDs (2) in addition to one DVD. (Though the DVD installer is way faster using the new tar installer)
  * We&#8217;re looking for help testing the beta as well. We have [use cases that need to be tested][14], and please [file any issues][15] you come across.
  * The first [Foresight User and Developer Conference][16] is definitely on, and the date has been finalized: April 18th, 19th and 20th. [Sign up on the wiki][16]. Open invite for all Foresight users, and we encourage upstream developers and other distros to come too!
  * The [latest Foresight newsletter][17] was released last Friday. Did you read it yet or [subscribe to it in your feedreader][18]?

We have even more news in the works, so keep an eye on [Planet Foresight][19]!
