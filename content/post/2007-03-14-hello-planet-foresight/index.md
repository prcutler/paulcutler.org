First of all, thank you for inviting me to join the Planet crowd &#8211; I&#8217;m very flattered and honored to be part of the community.

Who am I? I&#8217;m a married father of 3 living just outside of Minneapolis, MN USA, and when the kids aren&#8217;t keeping me busy, trying to learn how to contribute and help out with various projects, including [Banshee][1], [GNOME][2] and [Foresight Linux][3]. I&#8217;ve been using Linux for just over 8 years, a number of various distributions over that time, but was primarily a Red Hat Linux user, and then an Ubuntu user for the last couple of years before making the switch to Foresight about a month ago. This month marks the two year anniversary of using Linux as my only operating system on all my computers.

I am also an active believer and supporter of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation][4].

Some of the current areas I&#8217;m targeting to help out with are [documentation][5], including a [Getting Started guide][6] for users new to Foresight Linux; documenting the LiveCD release for both Foresight and GNOME; and helping out with [marketing][7] once that&#8217;s gets going. And who can forget submitting and triaging [bugs][8]!

This feed is my Linux RSS feed &#8211; if you want more ramblings on anything from copyright to sports to books and movies, feel free to visit my [blog][9], which I probably need to update more often. You can also find me on IRC on Gimpnet and Freenode as &#8220;silwenae&#8221;, [Mugshot][10], [Flickr][11] and [del.icio.us][12]. My handle / alias &#8220;silwenae&#8221; was a randomly generated name from an online roleplaying game that has stuck with me these last 7 or 8 years.

Thank you to the Foresight community for being so welcoming, and I look forward to helping out.
