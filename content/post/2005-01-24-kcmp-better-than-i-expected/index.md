My corporate firewall / proxy server defeated me at work today. I was unable to stream the Windows Media stream for [89.3, KCMP The Current][1]. So tomorrow, I shall go old school, and bring an old radio / small boombox. Take that corporate IT managers!

[The Current publishes their playlist for the last 6 hours][2], here&#8217;s a sample (in reverse order) of what I heard on the way home from work today:

The Jayhawks &#8211; I&#8217;d Run Away
  
Shivaree &#8211; I Close My Eyes
  
Iron & Wine &#8211; Teeth In The Grass
  
Pinetop Perkins &#8211; Meanest Woman
  
The Black Keys &#8211; Girl Is On My Mind
  
A.C. Newman &#8211; Miracle Drug
  
R.E.M. &#8211; Driver 8
  
T Rex &#8211; Mambo Sun
  
Fountains of Wayne &#8211; Radiation Vibe

They had a Beach Boys song in there too, that there website doesn&#8217;t list for whatever reason.

Looking through today&#8217;s playlist is absolutely amazing &#8211; Ani DiFranco (32 Flavors!), Dylan, Soul Coughing, a bunch of REM, Luna, deep cuts from Liz Phair, Luna, Muddy Waters and Sonic Youth. I could go on. This is everything I expected and more. I can&#8217;t communicate how happy and excited I am.

This is music. This is radio. This is freedom.
