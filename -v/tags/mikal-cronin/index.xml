With 2013 now in the books, I’d like to share some of my favorite albums of 2013. After Polica dropped their debut album digitally on December 20th, 2011, I’ve learned to wait until the year is over to share my favorite albums – don’t want to miss one!
These might not be the critic’s choices, but these are albums I like, and almost all of them I’ve bought on vinyl this year.</description>
