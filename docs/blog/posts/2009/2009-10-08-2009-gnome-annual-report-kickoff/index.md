It&#8217;s that time of year to start thinking about the GNOME Annual report and recapping all the wonderful activities the GNOME community has been involved in over the past year.

Lucas has done an [awesome][1] [job][2] over the last few years and this year has asked me to help with coordinating the annual report.

The annual report is one of the first things I ever contributed to GNOME (as an editor) and I hope I can do as good a job as Lucas has done.

With that said, we need your help! As I mentioned in the [kickoff email][3], we need help with:

  * Is this the right format? Are these the right sections?
  * Writers! Want to write one of these sections? Grab it! Want to write something not listed? Add it and write it!
  * Editors. Good editing is as important as good writing.
  * Artwork and layout.
  * High res photos of GNOME community members.

If you have ideas for articles that should be included, links and information for the authors, or any new ideas, please let me know or feel free to [edit the GNOME Annual Report 2009 wiki page][4]!

And just like Lucas has done in past years, don&#8217;t be surprised if I reach out to you individually to help.
