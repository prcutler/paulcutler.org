[Best of Bootie 2013][1] is out! And just in time for Christmas, too!

Featuring 22 of the year&#8217;s best mashups from some of the best DJs currently in the business, Best of Bootie 2013 is [available as one big MP3 file or 22 tracks in one convenient zip file][2]. Curated by [A Plus D, aka DJs Adrian & Mysterious D, founders of Bootie][3], they didn&#8217;t just stop with their 22 favorite mashups &#8211; there are also 10 bonus mashups available for download, too.

I&#8217;ve been listening to the Best of Bootie albums [since 2005][4] &#8211; it&#8217;s my go to music for running and working out and pretty much the only introduction I get to pop music these days. Give it a spin at the Soundcloud link above or [download it now][2] &#8211; you&#8217;ll love it. (Don&#8217;t wait either &#8211; songs have disappeared due to takedown notices. Get it while it&#8217;s hot!)
