      <description>Here’s some music news from the last few months you may have missed while I was being a slacker and not blogging.
 You can download The Hold Steady’s January 31, 2011 show at the Music Hall of Williamsburg in FLAC or MP3. In case you missed it, The Current launched a 24 hour local music station in April. All Minnesota artists, all the time – and it’s quite good! Listen on-line here.</description>

      <description>2010 has gone and now it’s time to share some of my favorite music of the year. Everyone has a top 10 list, so I thought I’d try something different. Well, that, and I can’t seem to whittle my list down to ten.
2010 was a great year for music. For the last few years music executives have been crying that the sky has falling as music sales decline. What they need to remember is that quality beats quantity – when they stop focusing on hit makers and on quality music and artists who will last, the sales will be there.</description>
