The music server is still coming along. I&#8217;m almost done ripping my CD collection, with less than 100 CDs to go. I have about 50 CDs I need to check the tags on that I ripped this weekend that I haven&#8217;t updated yet.

From there, I move them on to the backup box, get all the file directories set up correctly (that&#8217;s going to take a while), check all the tags one more time, and put them on the web server.

I&#8217;ve been ripping my CDs in [Ubuntu][1], with the MP3 debs. Sound Juicer doesn&#8217;t have quality settings, so I used [GooBox][2] to rip to MP3 at 192k. I use [Easytag][3] to update the tags, specifically the year and genre. GooBox unfortunately doesn&#8217;t capture the year from CDDB when it rips, and the genre&#8217;s are never right.

For whatever reason, whether it&#8217;s my DVD-RW is too sensitive, the OS, or the application, some CDs won&#8217;t rip, even with minor scratches. Even after burning copies of the CD, and using the burn to attempt the rip, it was no joy. Using my Windows box, I used [CDex][4] to rip, and didn&#8217;t have any issues, so I have a handful of those to rip as well.

The good news is I&#8217;m almost done. The bad news (for the music) is we completed the electrical in the basement this weekend (yay!). Once we pass inspection this week, then it&#8217;s a lot of manual labor to get all the insulation up in the ceiling. I&#8217;m in Seattle two weekends from now, so the goal is to get that all done this weekend. Fun.
