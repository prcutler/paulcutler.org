I was taking a peek at [WordPress.com][1] (more on that in a minute) and it showed one of the top hosted blogs there is the [Ubuntu weblog][2].

It already has some nice tips and tricks posted (like the bash command append). I&#8217;ll definitely be adding that to my blogroll.

WordPress.com is similar to Movable Type &#8211; hosted blog solution for users who don&#8217;t want or have a server to host their own blog on.
