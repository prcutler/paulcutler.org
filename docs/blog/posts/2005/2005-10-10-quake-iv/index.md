I&#8217;m excited to [see that Quake IV will have Linux support][1] via a client patch within a few weeks (the game went gold last week).

You have to love [iD Software][2] for doing the right thing &#8211; whether it&#8217;s Linux clients or GPL&#8217;ing the source of their games when they are done with them.

Though the [PC Gamer review score of 70%][3] is a little worrisome.

But it&#8217;s Raven and iD, and I love both studios for their quality work.
