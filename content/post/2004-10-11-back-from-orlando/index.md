Back from sunny Orlando.

Sunny and 85, with a few clouds on Fri. and Sat. Not that I&#8217;m complaining, though flying back today, the Twin Cities weather is nicer than it was there, but at least the storm we left in Orlando didn&#8217;t have a name.

Not sure how I survived 4+ days without internet access, lots of work and lots of play got me through.

Off to Chicago this week for the BFG lan party, I may try to blog it live. It will depend on the setup there, and transferring photo&#8217;s from my camera to the PC to the website, we shall see, it might be kind of cool to try. Long as I don&#8217;t pass out again.

Packers better win tonight. That is all.
