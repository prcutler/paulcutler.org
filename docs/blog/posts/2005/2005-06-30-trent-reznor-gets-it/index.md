Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails gets it. It being the [remix culture][1].

Mr. Reznor [has released the second single][2], _Only_ to be remixed. _The Hand That Feeds_ was the first single released, in Garage Band format only at the time.

This time around, it&#8217;s been released in 4 different file formats, including Acid Express and Garage Band so Windows users have a shot at remixing this time. I have a copy of the former around somewhere, and the latter on my Mini. I might try my hand at it this time.

It&#8217;s very cool of NIN to give back to the community. I downloaded a few of the remixes for _The Hand That Feeds_ last time, and some were pretty good.
