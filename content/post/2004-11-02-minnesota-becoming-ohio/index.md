And I&#8217;m not talking about conservatism.

The Minneapolis Star Tribune&#8217;s [lead story at this hour][1] is about election concerns in Minnesota.

Higher than expected turnout, and that&#8217;s saying something as Minnesota led the nation 4 years ago at 69%, reports of voter intimidation, Moveon.org staffing their tables, and running out of new voter registration cards are just some of the things covered in the article.

And the mouthpiece of the Republican party, Norm Coleman, mouthing off about concerns of fraud.
